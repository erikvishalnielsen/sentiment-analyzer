        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\n(Reuters) - CrowdStrike has been sued by shareholders who said the cybersecurity company defrauded them by concealing how its inadequate software testing could cause the July 19 global outage that crashed more than 8 million computers.\n\nIn a proposed class action filed on Tuesday night in the Austin, Texas federal court, shareholders said they learned that CrowdStrike's assurances about its technology were materially false and misleading when a flawed software update disrupted airlines, banks, hospitals and emergency lines around the world.\n\nThey said CrowdStrike's share price fell 32% over the next 12 days, wiping out $25 billion of market value, as the outage's effects became known, Chief Executive George Kurtz was called to testify to the U.S. Congress, and Delta Air Lines reportedly hired prominent lawyer David Boies to seek damages.\n\nThe complaint cites statements including from a March 5 conference call where Kurtz characterized CrowdStrike's software as \"validated, tested and certified.\"\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Austin-based CrowdStrike said: \"We believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company,\" Kurtz and Chief Financial Officer Burt Podbere are also defendants.\n\nThe lawsuit led by the Plymouth County Retirement Association of Plymouth, Massachusetts, seeks unspecified damages for holders of CrowdStrike Class A shares between Nov. 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024.\n\nShareholders often sue companies after unexpected negative news causes stock prices to fall, and CrowdStrike could face more lawsuits.\n\nDelta Chief Executive Ed Bastian told CNBC on Wednesday that the outage cost his airline $500 million, including lost revenue and compensation and hotels for stranded fliers.\n\nCrowdStrike shares closed on Wednesday down $1.69 at $231.96. They closed at $343.05 on the day before the outage.\n\nThe case is Plymouth County Retirement Association v CrowdStrike Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas, No. 24-00857.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Sandra Maler)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Airfreight proved resilient post-CrowdStrike. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nNew data from Xeneta shows airfreight returned to normal levels just nine days after the July 19 CrowdStrike Windows outage.\n\nThousands of flights were canceled at a time when airfreight demand is soaring, creating concern among logistics managers.\n\nWenwen Zhang, airfreight analyst at Xeneta, tells American Shipper that the cargo backlogs caused by the IT failure increased the cargo load factor (Xeneta\u2019s measurement of available capacity against volume/weight of goods flown) of some airlines by up to 4 percentage points compared to the previous week. Cargo load factors mostly returned to pre-IT failure levels on July 28.\n\n\u201cMost flight cancellations were quickly reversed and air cargo once again showed resilience,\u201d said Zhang. \u201cThis was helped in the fact there are currently more passenger flights due to summer travels, which provides more belly capacity.\u201d\n\nXeneta data shows the cargo load factor for July increased by 5 percentage points year on year to reach 59%. Compared to low demand in July 2023, airlines are now seeing strong demand from e-commerce.\n\n\u201cThe summer should be a quieter time of year for airfreight, but July saw the sixth consecutive month of general cargo spot rate increases,\u201d said Zhang. \u201cShippers and freight forwarders have real concerns ahead of the traditional peak season later in the year because there is going to be a scramble to secure capacity, which means increasing rates.\u201d\n\nThe increase in demand has throttled July spot prices by 13% year on year.\n\nXeneta data shows the global average air cargo spot rate for the last week of July reached its highest level of the year at $2.70 per kilogram. July marks the sixth consecutive month of growth.\n\n\u201cThe increasing global demand for air cargo in 2024 is driven largely by the phenomenal rise of e-commerce from China,\u201d said Zhang. \u201cThere is also the knock-on impact of disruption to ocean container services due to conflict in the Red Sea, which has seen some shippers turn to airfreight to protect supply chains.\u201d\n\nGlobal air cargo supply grew at a much lower pace of 2% year on year in July.\n\n\u201cGlobal air cargo supply chains are under huge pressure in 2024, with increasing demand far outstripping supply growth,\u201d warned \u00a0Zhang. \u201cThe last thing shippers needed was the global IT failure on July 19th, which saw thousands of flights delayed and canceled at major airports worldwide.\u201d\n\nZhang added: \u201cThere is also a balancing act for carriers in managing different customer groups. They want to benefit from the huge volumes of goods being shipped by e-commerce giants like Temu and Shein. But they also have their wider customer base to think about \u2013 if there is limited capacity available later in the year, then who will they prioritize?\u201d\n\nThe post Airfreight shows resiliency post-CrowdStrike, Xeneta data shows appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian says the airline is facing $500 million in costs related to a global tech outage this month that disrupted emergency services, communications and thousands of businesses.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC, Bastian said Wednesday that the monetary amount represents lost revenue as well as \u201cthe tens of millions of dollars per day in compensation and hotels\u201d for the five-day period.\n\nA week ago, CrowdStrike blamed a bug in an update that allowed its cybersecurity systems to push bad data out to millions of customer computers, setting off the global tech outage that grounded flights, took TV broadcasts off air and disrupted banks, hospitals and retailers.\n\nCybersecurity company CrowdStrike also outlined measures it will take to prevent the problem from recurring, including staggering the rollout of updates, giving customers more control over when and where they occur, and providing more details about the updates that it plans.\n\nAmong airlines, Delta was by far the hardest hit hard by the outage, having to cancel thousands of flights, because key systems were crippled by the incident.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation is investigating why Delta failed to recover as quickly as other airlines. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said last week that the department would also examine Delta\u2019s customer service, including \u201cunacceptable\u201d lines for assistance and reports that unaccompanied minors were stranded at airports.\n\nBastian said on CNBC that Delta will be seeking damages from the disruptions. CrowdStrike has not made any offers to help Delta financially so far, he added. It has offered free consulting advice.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): Hedge Funds Are Bullish on This Cybersecurity Stock Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other cybersecurity stocks.\n\nThe growth in internet use has made connectivity ubiquitous across the daily lives of businesses and individuals. It has also opened up more avenues for nefarious individuals or organizations to run financial heists, steal confidential data, or disrupt critical infrastructure and systems. The scale of these activities is staggering as well, with research outlining that as of 2021, cyber criminals caused a stunning $6 trillion in damages - an impact greater than all but the two largest economies in the world.\n\nThese threats have led to the growth of a vibrant cybersecurity industry which came into the spotlight of global media coverage in July 2024 after an outage affected an unbelievable 8.5 million computers worldwide. The outage shed light on the intricate nature of the global computing ecosystem as well as the risks that are present if security infrastructure has a single point of failure. While it's too early to speculate on the losses, some estimates from insurer Parametrix show that insured losses could touch as much as $1 billion for Fortune 500 companies. As if this weren't enough, the insurance firm's CEO believes that the global impact could be several times higher. He estimates that the total financial losses could sit at $15 billion while global insured losses could range between $1.5 billion to $3 billion.\n\nLooking at the scale of these losses, it's only natural to ask, what caused the global cyber outage? Well, the problem started when a cybersecurity provider that was the third biggest cybersecurity company in the world, rolled out an upgrade for its Falcon security platform. This caused systems that used the Windows operating system to crash since the software upgrade included a corrupted file that works with the deepest level of a computer called a kernel. The OS showed the infamous blue screen of death, which is the software's response to protect the user from damage to the kernel that can lead to a loss of data. The disruption lasted for quite a while too since all the systems affected by the update have to be manually booted into safe mode to remove the corrupted file before they can normally function.\n\nComing back to the financial side of the cybersecurity industry, like other sectors, it is also facing disruption through artificial intelligence. Research shows that the AI driven cybersecurity industry was worth $20 billion in 2023. From then until 2027, the sector is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.3% for a final value of $49.2 billion. In other words, the industry is expected to more than double in four years. As for the costs of cybersecurity breaches, they're also expected to grow from 2021 levels in the age of AI. These costs are estimated to sit at $8 trillion by 2023 end and jump to $10.5 trillion by 2025 end. The current era in the finance industry is marked by high interest rates, and they've made their impact on cybersecurity mergers too. In 2023, 363 M&A deals were announced in the cybersecurity industry, for an 18.8% annual drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nWithin these deals, strategic buyers, i.e. those that buy firms that align with their business strategies, accounted for 57.3% of the deals. Despite the lower number of deals, valuations remained robust. Between Q4 2020 and Q4 2023, average EV/Revenue and EV/EBITDA multiples in the cybersecurity M&A sector were 3.3x and 11.6x, which were higher than the broader averages of 2.1x and 10.4x.\n\nDelving deeper, despite the tough business spending and inflation in 2023, cybersecurity stocks did post some returns. These came at a time when broader software as a service (SaaS) stocks were struggling due to corporate uncertainty about future spending plans. The Houlihan Lokey Cybersecurity Index, which tracks the performance of 28 top cybersecurity stocks, increased by 83% year to date by 2023 end and jumped by 28% during the fourth quarter. These returns were accompanied by a revenue growth of 18% and a stronger earnings growth of 29%, showing the benefits of operating in a high margin software industry which allows cybersecurity stocks to eke out more pennies on the dollar when it comes to profit. While the 83% returns of the index themselves mark a strong lead of 58 percentage points over the flagship S&P, this band widens when we further narrow down the top cybersecurity stocks to only include the high growth firms. Their last twelve month returns as of 2023 end were 101% for an even wider band of 76 percentage points.\n\nShifting towards valuation, like the broader SaaS industry, cybersecurity stocks are primarily evaluated through their enterprise value to revenue. The high growth cybersecurity stocks had a median EV/2024E Revenue ratio was 9.8x. For the medium and low growth stocks, the median ratios were 5.9x and 3.0x. respectively. Crucially, ratios for high and medium growth cybersecurity stocks were significantly higher than the EV/Revenue ratios of acquisition targets that we've shared above. This implies that as far as the current environment for cybersecurity acquisition goes, value seems to be driving at least some deals as businesses find it difficult to raise capital because of high interest rates. As for revenue growth percentage, the median values ranged between 33% for the high growth firms to 4% for the low growth firms.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we ranked the holdings of multiple cybersecurity ETFs by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q1 2024 and selected the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Best Video Surveillance and Private Security Stocks to Buy\n\nSecurity personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q1 2024: 76\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) provides a cloud based platform for a variety of cybersecurity products such as identity management, threat detection and protection, threat intelligence, and data protection amongst others. Its shares are the talk of the cybersecurity industry during July 2024 due to a historic outage that many believe is the largest in its history. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s shares sank by 23% in July after a corrupted file froze millions of computers worldwide after a software update. The nature of this update, which targets the heart of a computer called a kernel, meant that a remote reboot was impossible and technicians had to manually remove the file on the computers. Estimates show that the losses can go as high as $15 billion, and the share price fall was a perfect illustration of how cybersecurity stocks can lose billions in the blink of an eye. The outage has also altered CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s hypothesis, and it could deal with lower revenue through customer loss or weakening cash flows if potential legal actions against it lead to negative outcomes.\n\nPrior to the outage, Carillon Tower Advisors mentioned CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q1 2024 investor letter where it was quite optimistic about the firm:\n\n\"CrowdStrike Holdings, a security software provider, reported strong earnings results, driven by strength in endpoint security, cloud security, and identity protection. Revenue growth and profitability metrics exceeded investor expectations for the quarter, and the forward guidance was ahead of expectations as well. The cyber threat environment remains elevated, and it is likely that the rise of artificial intelligence will make it easier for criminals and threat actors to design and launch sophisticated attacks, increasing the need for CrowdStrike.\"\n\nOverall CRWD ranks 3rd on our list of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy.

While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Why CrowdStrike (CRWD) Shares Are Getting Obliterated Today",
        "content": "Why CrowdStrike (CRWD) Shares Are Getting Obliterated Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) fell 12.5% in the afternoon session after CNBC reported that Delta Air Lines hired famous attorney David Boies to seek damages following the recent cybersecurity incident that caused a global tech outage. The incident was caused by a faulty update developed by CrowdStrike that affected millions of PCs running the Windows operating system, disrupting critical business services. According to the sources, no lawsuit has been filed yet; however, the airline is seeking compensation from CrowdStrike and Microsoft, given the damages caused by the incident.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nCrowdStrike's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 16 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for CrowdStrike and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 8 days ago, when the company dropped 13.7% as investors continued to assess the potential implications of the recent technology outage. On Friday, July 19, 2024, a security update pushed by CrowdStrike caused a global tech outage, with millions of Windows devices malfunctioning. Some displayed the dreaded \"blue screen of death\u2014an error screen that indicated a system crash.\" In a press statement released after the incident, Microsoft estimated the total number of affected Windows systems to be 8.5 million devices. While it represented less than 1% of all Windows devices, the impact appeared severe, disrupting critical systems such as hospitals, banks, and airports. The company has since deployed a fix.\n\nInvestors are likely uncertain about the knock-on effects of the incident. There could be concerns about the potential impact on the company's brand as markets access the losses caused by the incident. There is also uncertainty about the magnitude of expenses that will be incurred in the coming months due to the incident, which could include compensation to the affected parties.\n\nMultiple Wall Street analysts have since downgraded the stock's rating, citing some of these concerns. Guggenheim\u00a0analyst John DiFucci moved from a Buy to a Neutral rating, highlighting potential \"\u00a0resistance\u00a0to new deals in the near term.\" The analyst provided more reason for the downgrade, adding, \"The company's response to the issue it caused was impressive, but nevertheless, it caused significant disruption to businesses (and people) across the world. The restoration of its reputation may take more time and will likely affect new business signings, at least in the near term.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly, a BTIG analyst downgraded the stock's rating from Buy to Neutral, expressing worries about the incident, and cited\u00a0\"more negative feedback than expected.\"\u00a0 Overall, these sentiments imply the market is still unsure about the overall impact of the incident. The stock's decline also suggests CrowdStrike has a huge task ahead as it works to regain the trust of all parties impacted by the incident.\n\nCrowdStrike is down 6.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $230.79 per share it is trading 41.1% below its 52-week high of $392.15 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,454.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Shares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) continue to drop on Tuesday after its major software update problem of more than a week ago. The stock was already down more than 30% from recent highs, and investors might have thought that the worst was over once the problem had been corrected. But today, Delta Air Lines is reminding investors that this ordeal is far from over, which is why CrowdStrike stock was down 9% as of 10:45 a.m. ET.\n\nWho is going to pay Delta's bill?\n\nOn July 19, CrowdStrike updated its software. But the update had a defect, which knocked out Microsoft's Windows operating system for businesses around the world. Major airlines were among those with systems that went down, causing widespread travel delays. And now, Delta may be looking for compensation.\n\nAccording to CNBC, Delta just hired prominent attorney David Boies, which suggests that it may be considering a lawsuit against CrowdStrike. The cost of the outage for Delta alone is estimated to be up to $500 million.\n\nWhat can investors expect?\n\nThere are legitimate reasons for investors to be concerned about future growth for CrowdStrike. While business has been booming, the company may have suffered some reputational damage because of its misstep, which may keep some customers from signing new contracts in the near term.\n\nEven if CrowdStrike's revenue doesn't take a hit from this, this news from Delta is a reminder that its cash position could be hurt. A court could rule that it's on the hook for Delta's expenses. And that's just one airline. The company could be facing similar litigation from the other major airlines that went down during the ordeal.\n\nWith roughly $3 billion in net cash as of the latest quarter, CrowdStrike is in a strong financial position to overcome its costly error. That's good. But if it has to compensate all the businesses that went down in the Windows outage, it will undeniably hit shareholder value, which is why CrowdStrike stock is still falling today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Here's Why I'm Not Selling CrowdStrike Stock --Yet",
        "content": "At the start of July, CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) investors were a happy bunch. The stock was up over 50% for the year and doing incredibly well.\n\nUnfortunately, CrowdStrike stumbled over its own feet when it launched an update with an error that caused millions of devices to crash. This was claimed by some to be the biggest IT outage in history, which isn't something you want hanging over your head.\n\nThe aftermath of that issue caused the stock to fall by about 35% from its all-time highs. Most people would likely have seen this as a clear sell sign, as the optics of this failure could spill over into its business.\n\nHowever, I'm not to that point. I don't think panic-selling CrowdStrike is a good idea, but I may change my mind after more information comes to light in a few weeks.\n\nCrowdStrike's platform is still the best in its industry\n\nCrowdStrike provides one of the most vital services in today's market: cybersecurity. What many people are forgetting after this self-inflicted damage is that CrowdStrike has prevented countless cyberthreats that could have caused similar (or worse) outages.\n\nCrowdStrike's software monitors activity and determines what is normal and what could constitute a threat. Once it detects a threat, it shuts down network access to this device.\n\nThis is the primary function of the CrowdStrike Falcon platform, but customers can also add more functionality. With products in the cloud security, identity protection, and threat intelligence space, there are more than 20 modules that customers can add to the base product.\n\nAt the end of Q1 FY 2025 (ending April 30), 65% of CrowdStrike's customer base used at least five modules. That's a deeply integrated software with wide functionality, and replacing it would be costly, difficult, and time-consuming. Furthermore, its customers would likely have to piece together the same offerings from different cybersecurity vendors, which could cause some compatibility issues. There is very little chance this piecemeal option is cheaper or more effective, so I rate the chances of a mass exodus from CrowdStrike's product as fairly low.\n\nCrowdStrike already released its indictment review report and has vowed to make changes, so this does not happen again. Whether the market regains confidence in the company or not remains to be seen, but CrowdStrike cannot afford another outage like this.\n\nThis isn't the first time a company has had a significant public issue. Many have happened before; some companies recover, while others never do.\n\nTake Chipotle, for example. From 2015 to 2018, it had multiple health scares from its food, and while that affected its business in the short term, it had no effect on the long-term outcome. Customers obviously had other food choices available, but they kept coming back to Chipotle because of the quality of the restaurant.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is a story CrowdStrike investors can latch on to. I might have a different opinion if CrowdStrike weren't best-in-class or highly integrated into thousands of companies. But right now, I don't think it's time to sell.\n\nWhat would cause me to sell?\n\nHowever, that could all change when CrowdStrike reports Q2 earnings around late August to early September. That will be a must-listen conference call, as management will undoubtedly get a barrage of questions from analysts trying to understand how the outage affected business.\n\nI will be looking to see if management reports a significant departure of its customer base. I'm not terribly concerned if it sees some slowdown in new contracts signed. With the widespread news coverage of this outage, nearly all clients who were going to sign a contract with CrowdStrike will likely reassess.\n\nThis will undoubtedly cause some deals to fall apart or not be worth as much money due to CrowdStrike sweetening the deal to get clients to the signing table, but I'm not concerned about the short term.\n\nCrowdStrike's full-year revenue guidance will be my biggest focus. If it stays the same, that's great news. If it dramatically falls, I'll likely be headed for the exit, indicating some of its long-term subscription clients have left.\n\nUntil we have that information, everyone is just guessing about CrowdStrike's stock. However, I'm fairly confident CrowdStrike will stay strong throughout this adversity and remain one of the best cybersecurity investments on the market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Shares of CrowdStrike fell more than 4% in premarket trading on Tuesday after a report Delta Air Lines will seek compensation from the cybersecurity firm over the recent global IT outage that crippled industries including airlines.\n\nThe cyber outage led to more than 2,200 flight cancellations on July 19 and Delta has canceled over 6,000 flights so far since then.\n\nCrowdStrike's \"Falcon Sensor\" software had caused Microsoft Windows to crash and display a blue screen, known informally as the \"Blue Screen of Death\".\n\nDelta has hired a law firm and will also seek compensation from Microsoft, CNBC reported on Monday.\n\nCrowdStrike's stock, which had more than doubled in 2023, has fallen over 24% since the outage, leading to a loss of over $20 billion in market valuation.\n\nMany clients are considering slowing or pausing spending on CrowdStrike and expecting pricing concession, according to a survey by Evercore ISI.\n\n\"Nearly everyone agreed that they expect some form of monetary relief, such as discounts, service revenue credits, or free products,\" the brokerage said in a note on Tuesday, adding that feedbacks from clients suggest that CrowdStrike was already discussing this with its customers.\n\nAnalysts at Needham said damages from the outage will lead to \"hindered customer willingness to rely heavily on singular platforms, as that choice introduces concentration risk.\"\n\nThe brokerage said that CrowdStrike customers it spoke to displayed frustration over the outage, depicting it as a \"total nightmare\" disrupting their business during one of the year's busiest travel and shopping periods.\n\n(Reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese; Editing by Maju Samuel)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Should You Buy CrowdStrike Stock Now or Wait?",
        "content": "It's been a rough couple of weeks for CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD).\n\nThe leading endpoint-cybersecurity provider experienced the biggest crash in its history and what some believe could be the biggest IT failure ever.\n\nA buggy software update from CrowdStrike crashed Microsoft Windows operating systems around the world, leading to major disruption in global industries such as airlines, broadcasting, and retail.\n\nAs a result, CrowdStrike stock crashed as well, falling 11% on July 19 and another 13.5% on July 22 as problems with its software lingered after the weekend. By the end of the week, the stock had lost another 3%, falling more than 25% from before the outage happened.\n\nThe sell-off in the stock seems deserved given the reputational damage to the company and the potential challenges to retaining and adding new customers.\n\nHowever, savvy investors also know that these types of sell-offs can be good buying opportunities as the stock could recover those losses as coverage of the incidents fades and CrowdStrike returns to business as usual.\n\nSo should you buy CrowdStrike now or wait until the company's status is clearer? To answer that question, let's take a look at the state of play with CrowdStrike following the outage. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe path to recovery\n\nThere is some good news for CrowdStrike investors last week. CEO George Kurtz said on Friday that nearly all (or roughly 97%) connected devices were back online.\n\nCrowdStrike will have to do damage control to reassure customers that it's reliable and that the problem, which was an error in its software update and not a cyberattack, won't happen again.\n\nHowever, there are reasons to think that the company can overcome the mistake over time. First, the increased awareness around CrowdStrike and global IT infrastructure could lead to more hiring and spending around cybersecurity and IT infrastructure. Companies may also choose multiple cybersecurity services, creating redundancies to protect themselves.\n\nThere's another reason to believe that CrowdStrike stock can bounce back from the recent setback.\n\nSpending on cybersecurity isn't going away and will continue to grow. Customers have a choice of CrowdStrike or a competitor like Palo Alto Networks, SentinelOne, and even Microsoft's own endpoint-cybersecurity software.\n\nBut other companies have also faced challenges, such as outages and negative media attention, and the stocks have rebounded.\n\nOne of the best-known data breaches was of Equifax in 2017, exposing the personal information of 147 million people. The stock plunged on that news but had recovered nearly all of those losses six months later.\n\nStory continues\n\nCloud-identity specialist Okta has also sustained multiple breaches since 2022, but the stock has crept higher since then.\n\nThat's not to say that the CrowdStrike incident doesn't matter. Its reputation has taken a hit. Some customers may choose to switch to a rival, and the company may have to spend more on controls to make sure this doesn't happen again and assuage customers of the same.\n\nShould you buy CrowdStrike now or wait?\n\nCrowdStrike stock deserves to take a setback for the faulty software update, but a 25% haircut seems excessive.\n\nThe cybersecurity stock is still expensive, trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 19, but it's growing quickly with revenue up 33% in its most recent quarter and has strong profit margins after adjusting for share-based compensation.\n\nGiven its lofty valuation, CrowdStrike could fall further, but the sell-off driven by a temporary news event looks like a good buying opportunity for the stock. A smart approach would be to open a small position but keep some cash in reserve to buy the stock if it falls further.\n\nThe long-term picture still looks bright for CrowdStrike despite the recent setback. Don't be surprised to see the stock start to rebound in the coming weeks as investors look forward to its earnings report in a month.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) standing at $258.81, reflecting a +1.03% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.08% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.12%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.07%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the cloud-based security company had lost 33.15% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 4.62% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.21% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of CrowdStrike Holdings in its upcoming release. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $0.99, showcasing a 33.78% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $959.84 million, up 31.19% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $3.97 per share and revenue of $3.99 billion, indicating changes of +28.48% and +30.62%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for CrowdStrike Holdings. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.67% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. As of now, CrowdStrike Holdings holds a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that CrowdStrike Holdings has a Forward P/E ratio of 64.55 right now. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 31.36 of its industry.\n\nOne should further note that CRWD currently holds a PEG ratio of 2.95. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Internet - Software industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.8 as of yesterday's close.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 97, positioning it in the top 39% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups.

        "title": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this cloud-based security company have returned -33.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which CrowdStrike falls in, has lost 7.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.99 per share, indicating a change of +33.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.97 points to a change of +28.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.7%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.78 indicates a change of +20.5% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, CrowdStrike is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRWD _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate of $959.84 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +31.2%. The $3.99 billion and $4.98 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +30.6% and +24.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $921.04 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +33%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.57 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $904.82 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.79%. The EPS surprise was +4.49%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "2 S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy Before They Soar as Much as 80% According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "After notching another all-time high earlier this month, the S&P 500 index has been taking a breather. The widely followed benchmark index -- composed of 500 of the largest U.S. companies -- has hit new highs 38 times thus far in 2024, so it's earned a break.\n\nSome investors believe this pause could be a sign the rally is on its last legs, but others on Wall Street are unconcerned. Among the bulls is XM Investment analyst Marios Hadjikyriacos. \"Stock markets are enjoying the best of all worlds, buoyed by a resilient U.S. economy and speculation that Fed rate cuts are just around the corner, helping to justify stretched valuations,\" he wrote.\n\nUBS analyst Mark Haefele is equally optimistic. \"All-time highs often generate investor concern that markets have peaked. Such worries are not supported by history,\" he wrote in a note to investors.\n\nWith that in mind, here are two S&P 500 stocks that still have serious room to run, according to select Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings: Implied upside of 76%\n\nUnless you've been living in a cave, you likely heard the news about CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) last week, and it wasn't good. The cybersecurity specialist sent out a software update that crashed Microsoft Windows, causing a global tech meltdown that disrupted banks, airlines, and hospitals, among others. CrowdStrike was left with some high-profile egg on its face, and CEO George Kurtz has been summoned before Congress to testify about his company's role in the breakdown. In the days that followed the incident, the stock crashed by as much as 35%.\n\nWhile the dust has yet to fully settle from the event, CrowdStrike did what it could to minimize the damage to its reputation. Executives were quick to communicate that the issue was \"not a security incident or cyberattack\" while also issuing an apology and deploying a fix within a matter of hours.\n\nWhile some investment banks downgraded the stock or lowered their price targets, Oppenheimer took a different view. While acknowledging the short-term fallout and potential near-term impact, its analysts maintained their outperform rating and price target of $450 on the stock. That would equate to an upside of about 76% from Friday's closing price.\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that most CrowdStrike customers are staying put, acknowledging the company's best-in-class cybersecurity solutions and recognizing that mistakes happen. Most on Wall Street seem to agree. Of the 52 analysts who cover the stock, 49 rate the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommend selling.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike's recent results help illustrate the stock's appeal. In its fiscal 2025 first quarter (which ended April 30), revenue grew 33% year over year to $921 million, and annual recurring revenue also grew by 33%. This suggests CrowdStrike's growth streak could have staying power over the long term.\n\nFurthermore, CrowdStrike's forward price/earnings-to-growth ratio -- a metric that factors in its impressive growth trajectory -- clocks in at less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\nCharter Communications: Implied upside of 80%\n\nCharter Communications(NASDAQ: CHTR) provides a wide range of broadband internet, cable, and wireless phone services to roughly 32 million residential and business customers across the U.S.\n\nThe end of the federal Affordable Connectivity Program has spooked investors regarding the stock, and stunted the company's growth. In the first quarter, its revenue rose just 0.2% to $13.7 billion, though earnings per share surged by 14%. That top-line result fueled a panic-induced stock price decline. Shares are still 19% off their high.\n\nMoffettNathanson partner and senior analyst Craig Moffett is realistic about the challenges ahead, but argues that a return to predictability in the broadband business will act as a catalyst for the company. He maintains a buy rating and $660 price target on the stock, which would equate to an upside of about 80% compared to Friday's closing price.\n\n\"We've long argued that Charter doesn't need to show 'broadband reacceleration,'\" Moffett pointed out. \"They merely need to show that broadband unit results are predictable enough ... to allow for focus on all the other good things ... (wireless, ARPU growth, margins).\"\n\nTrading at just 12 times trailing 12-month earnings, the stock looks like a steal for investors who have the proper time horizon and a cast-iron constitution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Better Cybersecurity Stock: CrowdStrike vs. Palo Alto Networks",
        "content": "Organizations around the world depend on cybersecurity to protect against hackers. The extent of that dependency became apparent on July 19 when a software update made by cybersecurity company CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) contained an error, causing widespread disruption across many businesses, including airlines, hospitals, and banks.\n\nThis unexpected incident prompted CrowdStrike shares to plummet 11% on the day of the outage. Since then, the stock has continued to drop, falling below $270 at the time of this writing, well off its 52-week high of $398 on July 9. Is this dip an opportunity to pick up the stock?\n\nOr is it better to buy shares in a CrowdStrike rival, such as Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW)? The stock's price has risen in the wake of CrowdStrike's botched software update. Let's compare these two cybersecurity companies to decide which is the better investment.\n\nEvaluating CrowdStrike\n\nWhile CrowdStrike's July 19 outage is an embarrassment for the company right now, what matters more to an investment decision is how the company can perform over the long haul. Based on its results so far this year, a case can be made for investors with a long-term view to take advantage of the stock's current price crash and buy.\n\nOne reason is CrowdStrike's outsize revenue growth. In its fiscal first quarter, ended April 30, the company delivered $921 million in sales, a 33% year-over-year increase.\n\nA factor in CrowdStrike's rising revenue has been customers adopting multiple cybersecurity solutions from the company. Its software platform offers various add-ons beyond basic monitoring, such as asking its security personnel to proactively hunt for cyber threats. In the first quarter, 65% of customers adopted five or more of these additional options, and deals involving eight or more add-ons grew 95% year over year.\n\nAlong with impressive sales growth, CrowdStrike's financials are strong. The company achieved a record free cash flow (FCF) of $322 million in its fiscal Q1, a 42% year-over-year increase.\n\nThe company exited Q1 with an excellent balance sheet. Total assets were $6.8 billion with cash and equivalents alone comprising $3.7 billion.\n\nTotal liabilities were $4.3 billion, and of that amount, deferred revenue accounted for $3.1 billion. This deferred revenue represents payments received from customers that will eventually be recognized as income once CrowdStrike fulfills its contract obligations.\n\nThe case for Palo Alto Networks\n\nWhile CrowdStrike's performance to date has been healthy, the same is true of rival Palo Alto Networks. In its fiscal third quarter, ended April 30, Palo Alto Networks saw revenue rise 15% year over year to $2 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, it generated fiscal third-quarter FCF of $492 million, up from the prior year's $401 million. Its balance sheet at the end of Q3 was exceptional with $17.9 billion in total assets, and cash and equivalents of $1.4 billion. Total liabilities were $13.5 billion with $10.2 billion of that in deferred revenue.\n\nAs part of a plan to grow its business, the company introduced a new strategy this year. The plan encourages customers to consolidate their cybersecurity spending from multiple vendors to Palo Alto Networks. So far, the results suggest the strategy is working.\n\nIn its fiscal third quarter, the number of accounts spending more than $1 million with the company increased 22% year over year, while those spending greater than $10 million rose 28% year over year.\n\nCEO Nikesh Arora highlighted how one business unhappy with its existing cybersecurity vendor opted for Palo Alto Networks because of its \"ability to deliver consolidated capabilities through a platform across half a dozen areas.\"\n\nChoosing between CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks\n\nBoth CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks have delivered impressive performances this year, so another factor to consider when deciding between these two stocks is valuation. The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is a commonly used metric for this. PANW PE Ratio Chart\n\nCrowdStrike's P/E ratio is about 10x higher than Palo Alto Networks', even after its share price dropped due to the July 19 outage. This indicates Palo Alto Networks' stock is a better value.\n\nCombining valuation with its strong performance in fiscal 2024 makes Palo Alto Networks stock a compelling investment. Adding to this is that the long-term fallout from CrowdStrike's bungled software update is unclear at this time.\n\nAs a result of the July 19 outage, some Wall Street analysts downgraded CrowdStrike stock. For instance, Guggenheim's John DiFucci stated, \"There likely will be negative effects on its business due to the disorder across the world that CrowdStrike has caused, even if temporary.\"\n\nDiFucci has a point. In fact, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced he halted the use of CrowdStrike after its software issue arose.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, at this time, the better stock to buy in this contest of cybersecurity titans is Palo Alto Networks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 \u201cMove fast and break things,\u201d a high-tech mantra popularized 20 years ago by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, was supposed to be a rallying cry for game-changing innovation. It now seems more like an elegy for a society perched on a digital foundation too fragile to withstand a defective software program that was supposed to help protect computers \u2014 not crash them.\n\nThe worldwide technology meltdown caused a flawed update installed earlier this month on computers running on Microsoft's dominant Windows software by cybersecurity specialist CrowdStrike was so serious that some affected businesses such as Delta Air Lines were still recovering from it days later.\n\nIt's a tell-tale moment \u2014 one that illustrates the digital pitfalls looming in a culture that takes the magic of technology for granted until it implodes into a horror show that exposes our ignorance and vulnerability.\n\n\u201cWe are utterly dependent on systems that we don\u2019t even know exist until they break,\u201d said Paul Saffo, a Silicon Valley forecaster and historian. \u201cWe have become a little bit like Blanche DuBois in that scene from \u2018A Streetcar Named Desire,\u2019 where she says, \u2018I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2018Gum and shoelaces\u2019 and the perils of a connected world\n\nThe dependence \u2014 and extreme vulnerability \u2014 starts with the interconnections that bind our computers, phones and other devices. That usually makes life easier and more convenient, but it also means outages can have more far-reaching ripple effects, whether they are caused by a mistake like the one made by CrowdStrike or through the malicious intent of a hacker.\n\n\u201cIt might be time to look at how the internet works and then question why the internet works this way. Because there is a lot of gum and shoelaces holding things together,\u201d said Gregory Falco, an assistant professor of engineering at Cornell University.\n\nThe risks are being amplified by the tightening control of a corporate coterie popularly known as \u201cBig Tech\": Microsoft, whose software runs most of the world's computers; Apple and Google, whose software powers virtually all of the world's smartphones; Amazon, which oversees data centers responsible for keeping websites running (another key service provided by Microsoft and Google, too, in addition to its e-commerce bazaar); and Meta Platforms, the social networking hub that owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nIt's a highly concentrated empire with a few corridors open to a network of smaller companies such as CrowdStrike \u2014 a company with $3 billion in annual revenue, a fraction of the nearly $250 billion in annual sales that Microsoft reels in. All of the key players still tend to put a higher priority on the pursuit of profit than a commitment to quality, said Isak Nti Asar, co-director of the cybersecurity and global policy program at Indiana University.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe have built a cult of innovation, a system that says. \u2018Get technology into people\u2019s hands as quick as possible and then fix it when you find out you have a problem,\u2019\" Nti Asar said. \u201cWe should be moving slower and demanding better technology instead of giving ourselves up to these feudal lords.\u201d\n\nHow on Earth did we get here?\n\nBut is Big Tech to blame for that situation? Or is it 21st-century society that obliviously allowed us to get to this point \u2014 consumers eagerly buying their next shiny devices while gleefully posting pictures online, and the seemingly overmatched lawmakers elected to impose safeguards?\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to point the blame somewhere else,\" Saffo said, \u201cbut I would say you better start looking in the mirror.\u201d\n\nIf our digital evolution seems to be headed in the wrong direction, should we change course? Or is that even possible at a juncture where some credit card companies charge their customers a fee if they prefer to have their monthly billing systems delivered to them through a U.S. Postal Service that has become known as \u201csnail mail\u201d because it moves so slowly?\n\nRemaining stuck in a different era worked out well for Southwest Airlines during the CrowdStrike snafu because its system is still running on Windows software from the 1990s. It's such antiquated technology that Southwest doesn't rely on CrowdStrike for security. That sword has another, less appealing edge, though: Behaving like a Luddite hobbled Southwest during the 2022 holiday travel season when thousands of its flights were canceled because its technology was unable to properly adjust crew schedules.\n\nBut it's becoming increasingly untenable to toggle back to the analog and early digital era of 30 or 40 years ago when more tasks were done manually and more records were handled on pen and paper. If anything, technology appears destined to become even more pervasive now that artificial intelligence seems poised to automate more tasks, including potentially writing the code for software updates that will be checked by a computer \u2014 that will be overseen by another computer to make sure it's not malfunctioning.\n\nThat doesn't mean individual households still can't revert to some of their old tricks as a backup for when technology falters, said Matt Mittelsteadt, research fellow for Mercatus Center, a research institution at George Mason University. \u201cThere is this creeping realization that some of the things we once mocked, like putting a password on a Post-It note, isn't necessarily the worst idea.\"\n\nAt this juncture, experts believe both the government and the private sector need to devote more time mapping out the digital ecosystem to get a better understanding of the weaknesses in the system. Otherwise, society as a whole may find itself wandering through a field of digital land mines \u2014 while blindfolded. Says Mittelsteadt: \u201cWe have no intelligence about the environment we are operating in now other than that there is this mass of ticking time bombs out there.\u201d\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why CrowdStrike Stock Plummeted Again This Week",
        "content": "CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) stock saw another big sell-off in this week's trading. The company's share price ended this week's trading down 16% from last week's market close, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nLast Friday, CrowdStrike's software was at the center of a major IT outage -- and the event has triggered big sell-offs of the company's stock. The cybersecurity specialist's valuation pullback continued this week as investors and analysts weighed the potential fallout of the major system failure for the business.\n\nCrowdStrike's update on the big IT outage hasn't comforted investors\n\nDue to a bug contained in an automatic update that CrowdStrike rolled out last Friday, millions of computers using Microsoft's Windows operating system were taken offline last week. CrowdStrike has emerged as a leading provider of endpoint device protection and other related cybersecurity services, but last week's far-reaching IT meltdown has called the company's systems, performance outlook, and valuation into question.\n\nCEO George Kurtz provided an update on Thursday that said 97% of Windows sensors that had been taken down in the previous week's outage were now working again. Unfortunately, the recovery hasn't done much to assuage concerns among investors and analysts.\n\nAnalysts are cutting price targets on CrowdStrike\n\nOn Wednesday, Citigroup published a note on CrowdStrike maintaining a buy rating on the company's stock. On the other hand, lead analyst Fatima Boolani lowered the firm's one-year price target from $425 per share to $345 per share. If CrowdStrike were to hit that target, it would represent upside of roughly 35% compared to the company's current share price. But Boolani also highlighted a risk that CrowdStrike could fall to as low as $170 per share.\n\nIn a note published Thursday, Barclays lowered its one-year price target on CrowdStrike from $400 per share to $285 per share. Based on the cybersecurity specialist's share price at today's market close, that would imply upside potential of roughly 11%. While Barclays maintained an overweight rating on CrowdStrike stock, the dramatic downward revision for the price target on the stock suggests that the outage will continue to present substantial valuation headwinds.\n\nIn an optimistic scenario, Barclays thinks that CrowdStrike could climb back to $310 per share over the next year. But the firm also sees a risk that shares could fall to as low as $210 per share.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

The solution aims to improve end-to-end automation and data-driven decisions using self-service analytics and generative Private AI.\n\nThis business process management software provider is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +20.5%. Revenues are expected to be $142.07 million, up 11.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWhile earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor Appian, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on APPN going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "Here's what the CrowdStrike outage exposed about our connected world. It's not good.",
        "content": "Nearly a week after a massive IT outage shut down computer systems around the world, cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (CRWD) issued a statement Thursday revealing that a single software update was responsible for grounding planes, curtailing hospital procedures, and closing businesses for days.\n\nThe announcement came as the majority of companies returned to business as usual. But it points to the vulnerability of our modern internet infrastructure and how taking out even a relatively small number of devices \u2014 Microsoft (MSFT) estimates 8.5 million systems were affected \u2014 can impact our lives.\n\n\u201cWhat we see here is the cascading effect that a minor software update, or in the future, maybe a cyberattack or malicious code, can have a huge impact,\u201d David Bader, director of the Institute for Data Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nAnd without some kind of broader plan to address the matter, another widespread outage is all but guaranteed to happen.\n\n\u201cWhat we're seeing today is these types of cascading failures occurring more and more frequently,\u201d Bader said. \u201cThese will continue as we see AI, and as we move toward [artificial general intelligence], that these types of failures, whether they're accidental, some bad programming, such as CrowdStrike, or whether their malicious attacks, will continue showing the vulnerability of our technological world.\u201d\n\nA lack of coherent rules\n\nAccording to the announcement statement by CrowdStrike, the company issued a software update on July 19 that included a flaw that went undetected in validation checks. The error immediately crashed certain Windows systems connected to the web, causing them to display a crash message known as the blue screen of death.\n\nCrowdStrike says it\u2019s responding to the matter by reworking how it prepares its software updates, including more stringent testing and staggering deployment to prevent a global systems collapse in the future. Screens show a blue error message at a departure floor of LaGuardia Airport in New York on Friday, July 19, 2024, after a faulty CrowdStrike update caused a major internet outage for computers running Microsoft Windows. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that software is developed by people. And while they\u2019re usually incredibly capable people, they\u2019re still human, and humans make mistakes. That\u2019s generally how flaws enter software ecosystems, whether it\u2019s CrowdStrike\u2019s programs or some other company\u2019s platform.\n\n\u201cEven the best testing processes fail,\u201d explained Gartner analyst Jon Amato. \u201cYou can do a certain amount of automated testing, but those automated tests are themselves designed by human beings and human beings are fallible.\u201d\n\nAnd while CrowdStrike is certainly looking to improve its own internal processes as far as ensuring the stability of its software updates, that doesn\u2019t mean every other software company will do the same.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe really don't have any organization in the US that is looking holistically at our technological resilience,\u201d Bader said. StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe don't have a body that can generate the best practices needed for private industry to both protect against the delivery of the software updates and what a customer should do, for instance, the banks, the hospitals, the airlines, how they should protect themselves to ensure that these problems don't impact them in the future.\u201d\n\nAnd while the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency offers tips, there\u2019s no major enforcement mechanism in place to force companies to follow specific strategies when issuing software updates or addressing program failures and malicious attacks.\n\nWithout those, Bader said, a larger outage and prolonged recovery are bound to happen.\n\nA bigger problem?\n\nOutside of a need for a regimented approach to IT failures, the CrowdStrike outage also points to a broader problem within the backbone of the world\u2019s tech infrastructure: A small number of companies have an outsized impact on how the web operates.\n\n\u201cWe definitely know that these are very fragile systems, and the fact that they work as well as they do is, frankly, a miracle, given all of the different players, the lack of heterogeneity of the stack,\u201d Gregory Falco, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and systems engineering at Cornell University's Sibley School, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut expanding the number of companies that plug directly into our internet infrastructure isn\u2019t exactly an easy fix either. That\u2019s because the more companies there are, the more opportunities there are for failures.\n\nUltimately, the solution to these kinds of world-scale problems might just come down to forcing companies to be better prepared for catastrophe. And if software does fail, understanding how to contain the fallout. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "The Progressive and Kohl's have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 26, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares The Progressive PGR as the Bull of the Day and Kohl's KSS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on CrowdStrike CRWD, Okta OKTA, CyberArk Software CYBR and Zscaler ZS.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all six stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nThe Progressive has been a standout stock in the market leading insurance sector, delivering exceptional performance both in the short term and over the long haul. With a strong growth outlook, a top Zacks Rank, and a discounted valuation, Progressive stock is well-positioned to continue its impressive run.\n\nInvestors seeking a reliable, growth-oriented stock might consider Progressive as a key component of their portfolios.\n\nThe Progressive Stock Relative Strength\n\nProgressive stock has exhibited remarkable strength throughout the year, significantly outperforming the broader market.\n\nThis robust performance is not a recent phenomenon; Progressive has consistently delivered outstanding returns over the long term. Over the past 15 years, the stock has compounded at an annual rate of 18.8%, nearly 13xing investors' money during that period.\n\nThis track record of consistent growth underscores Progressive's resilience and its ability to thrive in various market conditions.\n\nSteadily Rising Earnings Revisions Trend\n\nProgressive's impressive business performance is reflected in its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. The company's earnings estimates have seen steady upward revisions over the past year, with analysts unanimously raising their forecasts across timeframes. This positive trend highlights the confidence analysts have in Progressive's growth prospects and increases the odds of a near-term rally.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to grow at an impressive annual rate of 23.8% over the next three to five years. This robust growth forecast is driven by Progressive's strong underwriting performance, innovative product offerings, and efficient cost management. As the company continues to capitalize on its competitive advantages, investors can expect sustained earnings growth.\n\nDiscounted Valuation at Progressive\n\nDespite its strong performance and promising growth outlook, Progressive is currently trading at a relatively discounted valuation. The stock's one-year forward earnings multiple stands at 17.9x, which is below the market average of 22.9x and below its five-year median of 20.6x. This attractive valuation provides a margin of safety for investors, reducing downside risk while offering substantial upside potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Progressive's PEG ratio is a mere 0.75, indicating that the stock is undervalued relative to its expected growth. This low PEG ratio suggests that Progressive offers exceptional value for growth-oriented investors, making it an appealing choice in today's market.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Progressive Corporation stands out as a top-performing stock with a strong growth outlook, favorable earnings revisions, and a discounted valuation. Its track record of consistent long-term growth, combined with its impressive short-term performance, makes it a compelling investment opportunity.\n\nAs the company continues to execute its growth strategy and capitalize on its competitive advantages, investors can expect Progressive to deliver sustained returns. For those looking to add a reliable, growth-oriented stock to their portfolios, Progressive should be at the top of the list.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nKohl's, a specialty department store chain with 1,100 locations across the United States, has struggled significantly in recent years due to deteriorating business fundamentals.\n\nThe company's lackluster performance is underscored by a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) rating, falling sales growth, and a relatively high valuation despite its challenges. Given this setup, investors should approach Kohl's stock with caution and consider avoiding it altogether.\n\nFalling Sales Growth at Kohl's\n\nOne of the most alarming signs for any company is negative sales growth over an extended period. Unfortunately for Kohl's, the company has experienced a 15% decline in sales over the past five years.\n\nThis downward trend is particularly concerning in the retail industry, where sustained growth is crucial for long-term success. As sales continue to fall, it becomes increasingly difficult to justify holding the stock until there is a significant turnaround.\n\nDeep Underperformance for Kohl's Stock\n\nKohl's stock has been a severe underperformer over the past decade, significantly lagging behind the broader market.\n\nThis underperformance is not just a relic of the past; recent performance has been equally dismal. Year-to-date, Kohl's stock is down 29% and is currently trading near its recent lows. This consistent downward trend highlights the ongoing challenges the company faces in a highly competitive retail environment.\n\nKohl's Valuation Remains Elevated\n\nDespite its weakening business fundamentals, Kohl's stock continues to trade at a relatively premium valuation. The stock's one-year forward earnings multiple is 14.4x, which is above its 10-year median of 11.1x and significantly higher than the industry average of 9x.\n\nThis elevated valuation is hard to justify given the company's declining sales and overall poor performance. Investors typically seek bargains in struggling companies, but Kohl's current valuation suggests it is far from being a bargain.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile Kohl's boasts a strong brand developed over many years, the retail and department store industry continues to face intense competition. The rise of e-commerce and changing consumer behaviors have put significant pressure on traditional brick-and-mortar stores like Kohl's.\n\nUntil Kohl's can address its growth issues in a material and sustainable way, the stock remains an unattractive option for investors. The combination of declining sales, poor stock performance, and an unjustifiably high valuation suggests that investors should steer clear of Kohl's for the foreseeable future.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nForget CrowdStrike (CRWD): 3 Quality Security Stocks to Buy Instead\n\nCrowdStrike has been one of the most prolific security software providers in recent times thanks to its Falcon platform. However, a faulty Falcon update on Jul 19 resulted in a global IT outage. CRWD shares dropped 11% on Jul 19 and have been on a downward spiral since then.\n\nThe blue screen of death (BSOD) outage reportedly impacted 8.5 million Windows machines. In its preliminary Post Incident Review (PIR), CRWD has blamed the BSOD outage on a bug in the Rapid Response Content, which somehow went undetected during validation checks.\n\nLosses from the massive IT outage are now expected between $400 million and $1.5 billion, per cyber analytics firm Cybercube, as cited by Reuters. Insurer Parametrix estimates insured losses between $540 million and $1.08 billion for Fortune 500 companies, excluding Microsoft.\n\nApart from the staggering losses, recovery from the IT outage is expected to take several days. CRWD's software runs at the kernel level of a computer, which helps it to detect cyberattacks more efficiently. However, computers affected by the bug are required to be rebooted manually to safe mode by an administrator and then delete the affected file. This is expected to be a time-consuming process.\n\nThe incident has significantly impacted CrowdStrike's reputation and brand value. CRWD is taking correctional measures as per the PIR, including enhanced software testing procedures, as well as a plan to conduct validation exercises through third-party. However, prospects don't look bright as the reputational damage can result in customer exodus, thereby hurting top-line growth.\n\nSince the incident, CRWD shares have declined more than 15%. Year-to-date, shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have gained 1.1%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's return of 18.6%.\n\n3 Better Bets Than CRWD Stock\n\nHere, we have picked three security stocks that are better bets than CrowdStrike. These stocks have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nPer the Zacks proprietary methodology, stocks with this favorable combination offer good investment opportunities.\n\nOkta is benefiting from an expanding clientele, driven by the strong adoption of its Identity Threat Protection solution. It exited the first quarter of fiscal 2025 with the total customer count increasing 6% year over year to 19,100.\n\nOkta's expanding portfolio has been a key catalyst. Its Okta AI, a suite of AI-powered capabilities embedded across both Workforce Identity Cloud and Customer Identity Cloud, empowers organizations to harness the power of AI to build better experiences and protect against cyberattacks.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, Okta expects revenues between $2.53 billion and $2.54 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 12%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $2.53 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.91%.\n\nOKTA expects fiscal 2025 non-GAAP earnings between $2.35 and $2.40 per share. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $2.40 per share, up 5.3% over the past 60 days.\n\nOkta currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of A. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nCyberArk Software is benefiting from the rising demand for cyber security and privileged access security solutions due to the long list of data breaches and increasing digital transformation strategies.\n\nCyberArk's security platforms simplify security infrastructure for organizations by protecting against, detecting and responding to cyber-attacks before the security of vital systems is compromised. This reduces the total cost of ownership, thereby giving the organization a competitive edge. CYBR's strategic mix shift toward software-as-a-service and subscription-based solutions is driving top-line growth.\n\nFor 2024, CyberArk expects revenues in the range of $928-$938 million, up from the previous guidance range of $920-$930 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $935.16 million, suggesting 24.38% growth over 2023.\n\nCYBR carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present and has a Growth Score of A. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has been steady at $2.04 per share over the past 60 days.\n\nZscaler is benefiting from a strong portfolio. Its Edge cloud for policy enforcement, multi-tenancy, proxy for SSL or TLS inspection and zero trust network access are well poised to gain adoption amid the thriving remote work culture.\n\nPortfolio expansion through acquisitions with the likes of Avalor, Canonic Security and ShiftRight is noteworthy. Avalor acquisition expands Zscaler's Zero Trust Exchange data, incorporating more than 150 pre-built integrations to empower customers in proactively identifying and predicting critical vulnerabilities while enhancing operational efficiencies. Canonic Security improved ZS' focus on protecting against attacks that target software-as-a-service. ShiftRight buyout boosted its cloud security offerings.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, Zscaler forecasts revenues in the range of $2.14-$2.142 billion, up from the previous guidance of $2.118-$2.122 billion. Calculated billings are now expected in the range of $2.603-$2.606 billion, up from the earlier guidance of $2.55-$2.57 billion.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $2.14 billion, indicating 32.39% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for fiscal 2024 earnings is pegged at $2.99 per share, up 9.5% over the past 60 days.\n\nZscaler has a Zacks Rank #2 at present and a Growth Score of A.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "3 Semiconductor Stocks to Bet On for Market-Crushing Returns",
        "content": "Just as the ancient Roman Empire was powered by human labor deployed in agriculture, the modern era relies on semiconductors to power the digital age. This makes investing in semiconductor stocks an easy proposition, as it is investing in the civilization itself.\n\nGlobally, the semiconductor stocks market is headed for a 10% CAGR by 2029 at $980.80 billion, according to Statista Market Insights. In the meantime, investors should put these stocks on a watchlist, if they haven\u2019t already.\n\nLet\u2019s explore three top semiconductor stocks to consider for massive portfolio returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo The logo of Nvidia AI displayed on smartphone screen. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Muhammad Alimaki / Shutterstock.com\n\nWidely viewed as overweight at a 72.29 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the psychological effect of the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) 10-for-1 stock split is not to be underestimated. Compared to its competitor AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), NVDA stock is priced cheaper. Simultaneously, it holds 88% dominance in the GPU market, per Jon Peddie Research as of Q1 of fiscal year 2024.\n\nWith equal cornering of the artificial intelligence (AI) generative demand market by providing both GPUs and a full-stack software suite for early large language model (LLM) trainers, much is also expected of Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell architecture. This new lineup of B100 and B200 GPUs purportedly offer up to 15x performance while drastically lowering power consumption.\n\nMoreover, according to a recent report, the B200 series AI chips are on their way to be repackaged as \u201cB20\u201d, a somewhat hobbled version intended for China due to US export control restrictions. Although China is busy building its own semiconductor foundries to counteract US pressure, the reliance of Chinese AI companies on Nvidia\u2019s CUDA platform is still in effect.\n\nAt the same time, the US could hit China with another block. If this happens to the H20 chip, the one Nvidia specifically designed to go around the export control license, the company could lose up to $12 billion revenue, according to Jeffries\u2019 latest notes to investors.\n\nWith that in mind, Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) upped NVDA stock target from $120 to $140. UBS is even more optimistic, citing robust Blackwell demand, having raised their price target from $120 to $150.\n\nAccording to 39 analyst inputs aggregated by Nasdaq, the average NVDA price target is $142.67 per share. At present $112.28 price, NVDA shares are below the 52-week high of $140.76. In the last three months, NVDA stock is up 53%.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the computer networking category, key player Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) caters to growing data center needs. The firm sells both multilayer network switches and software solutions to large enterprises. Those include cloud computing to high-performance computing (HPC) used in the training of AI models.\n\nIn light of the CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) debacle, it should also be noted that ANET uses a Linux-derived Extensible Operating System (EOS). The open standard OS is exceedingly customizable. It defines Arista Network\u2019s suite of products to scale data centers and connect multiple clouds.\n\nThe multi-purpose architecture of EOS separates protocol processing from state information. In other words, an in-service software upgrade with EOS wouldn\u2019t have disrupted the global economy as CrowdStrike with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows did.\n\nOn July 30th, Arista is scheduled to announce its Q2 FY24 earnings. In the prior quarter, the company reported 16.3% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth to $1.57 billion. Net income was even better, having increased by 46% to $637.7 million. In Q2, the company expects $1.62 to $1.65 billion revenue range.\n\nAnd, subsequent quarters may exceed that range. At the present price of $314.12, ANET stock is close to its 52-week high of 376.50, up 40% in the last three months. The average ANET price target is $324.5 with the high target of $385 per share.\n\nNXP Semiconductors (NXPI) A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nNXP Semiconductors (NASDASQ:NXPI) provides automakers with integrated circuits that make vehicles easier to drive and connect to digital platforms. Those include Ford (NYSE:F), Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMTF), BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) and Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VLKAF). Further, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was among the first to push this concept known as software-defined vehicles (SDVs).\n\nHowever, Tesla preferred to partner with Nvidia as NXP\u2019s direct competitor in the automotive solutions arena. Additionally, NXPI offers ultra-low-power microcontrollers alongside high-performance processors for the broad application in IoT and mobile\u2019s near-field communication (NFC) embedded systems.\n\nIn Q2 earnings delivered on Monday, the Dutch company reported $3.13 billion revenue, down 5% YOY. Likewise, the company\u2019s net income dropped 5.7%, at $658 million. This means that, although NXP beat earnings estimates for three consecutive quarters up until Q2, the surprise was only -0.71%, at $2.82 estimated versus $2.8 earnings per share reported.\n\nHowever, as a cyclical company, investors should expect to see tailwinds ahead, riding on NXPs S32 CoreRide platform for the next generation of SDVs. This makes NXPI as one of top semiconductor stocks in this exciting new market.\n\nPresently priced at $247.51, NXPI shares are up 20% over the last three months. Expected average price target is $294.52 per share. The high estimate is $370 based on Nasdaq data.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "If you're a CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) investor like myself, you've had a rough few days. After approaching nearly $400 at the beginning of July, it tumbled significantly after an automatic update rendered some Windows-powered devices unable to run.\n\nUnfortunately, the stock took a hit after the news broke as investors headed for the exits due to fears that the company could lose a significant portion of its customer base. I have some of those same concerns, but I'm still working through exactly what I should do, as CrowdStrike's platform is still far superior to anything else.\n\nAs a shareholder, I have three options: Sell my shares, buy more stock, or wait and see what happens.\n\nSell: CrowdStrike has a long road ahead\n\nIf you're a prospective CrowdStrike customer and were going to sign a contract to use its software, would you still do it now, days after the failure? Perhaps not. The same goes for any clients looking to renew their contracts. While this business isn't necessarily lost forever, these clients will take their time and thoroughly review to determine if CrowdStrike is still their ideal cybersecurity provider.\n\nUndoubtedly, there will be a few who say \"no\" that would have said \"yes\" if not for the events on July 19. So, regardless of the outcome, a CrowdStrike sell-off was certainly warranted.\n\nAdditionally, CrowdStrike's stock was trading at a very high valuation before this failure, so a pullback was likely inevitable. CRWD PS Ratio Chart\n\nHowever, I don't think panic selling is the right move here. CrowdStrike still has best-in-class software and is likely implementing systems to ensure this never happens again. But the damage is still done.\n\nBuy: CrowdStrike's stock hasn't been this cheap in a while\n\nAnother thought that crossed my mind was to load up on CrowdStrike stock. I'm still a believer in the company, thanks to its best-in-class solution. Furthermore, CrowdStrike's Falcon platform is so woven into the fabric of how many companies protect from cyber threats that switching away would be incredibly painful.\n\nWith high switching costs plus no other company offering the full functionality of the Falcon platform, it's hard to imagine a situation where customers are in a position to switch away from CrowdStrike. Furthermore, many of CrowdStrike's clients signed multiyear deals already, so the chance for them to switch to a competitor's product is still years away. By then, many will have forgotten about this issue, as less than 1% of Windows devices were affected by this issue.\n\nStory continues\n\nA prime example of this is Chipotle's various health scares from 2015 to 2018. Eventually, customers forgot, and the stock continued its massive run. I think this story is one that CrowdStrike investors can latch onto as hope in this trying time.\n\nThis pullback allows investors to buy the stock for about the same price as in December 2023, but I don't think there's any reason to be a hero and buy now. There could be more pain to come, and while I think I will be a long-term buyer of the stock, now isn't the right time to rush in.\n\nHold: We don't know everything right now\n\nAfter considering both the buy and sell camps, I've arrived at what I will do: Hold the stock. I don't like losing a significant chunk of my gains in CrowdStrike stock, but I think the long-term opportunity exists. Additionally, I want to hear what management says during its second-quarter conference call, which should occur sometime in late August or early September.\n\nManagement will offer insight into how this is impacting contracts, which could cause my opinion to sway toward the buy or sell side. However, I have no way of obtaining that information besides staying patient. If I could travel into the future and know exactly what I should do with my CrowdStrike shares, then this would be a mistake 100% of the time.\n\nHowever, I don't have that ability, and I know I've been burned more by making rash decisions than by being patient while investing.\n\nI'll decide after I know more about how this is truly affecting CrowdStrike's business. But for now, I think it's best to hold onto CrowdStrike stock and see the impact.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "CrowdStrike CEO Involved In Another Global Tech Disaster Years Ago? Unbelievably, Yes\n\nGeorge Kurtz, the CEO of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, is under the spotlight for a massive tech failure. Last Friday, a faulty update from CrowdStrike caused a worldwide tech outage that disrupted banks, airlines, retailers, and more. Shockingly, this isn\u2019t Kurtz\u2019s first rodeo with a tech catastrophe.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmerica's construction sites are desperate for Robots \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in a house-printing startup who\u2019s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry. Don\u2019t miss the real AI boom \u2013 here\u2019s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2011, Kurtz was the Chief Technology Officer at McAfee, another major name in cybersecurity. In 2010, McAfee released a flawed update that mistakenly identified a critical Windows file, \u201csvchost.exe,\u201d as a virus. This critical error crashed millions of computers and got them stuck in reboot loops.\n\nJust like last week, the only fix was a manual intervention, and similarly, that whole debacle created chaos for countless users and businesses.\n\nSee Also: Don\u2019t miss out on the next Nvidia \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nThe Ripple Effects Of The CrowdStrike Update Mess\n\nThe impact of CrowdStrike\u2019s faulty update was massive. According to Business Insider, major airlines like American, United, and Delta had to ground flights, leaving thousands of passengers stranded and causing travel chaos. European airlines, like Ryanair, also faced big delays and told passengers to arrive early to deal with the mess.\n\nThe UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) reported issues with appointment and patient record systems, even canceling medical procedures and appointments. In Germany, hospitals were forced to also cancel elective operations, adding to the strain on health care providers already dealing with other pressures.\n\nRetail operations were not spared either. Some Speedway gas stations in the U.S. had to close because digital gas pumps failed, and others could not accept payments.\n\nTrending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nWhy Did This Happen?\n\nCrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts. Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted. This is not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed. We...\n\n\u2014 George Kurtz (@George_Kurtz) July 19, 2024\n\nThe root cause of the disaster was a defect in a single update for Windows provided by CrowdStrike that led to widespread system failures. The issue was not the result of a cyberattack but rather a critical flaw in the update\u2019s coding. When released, it triggered a series of malfunctions in less than 1% of Windows machines.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the relatively small percentage, the number of systems affected was enough to create global chaos. In response to Kurtz\u2019s tweet, one Twitter user pointed out how little it takes to \u201cbring down half the computers around the world.\u201d\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s immediate response included identifying the issue, isolating it, and deploying a fix. However, Microsoft stated that some users fixed their problems by rebooting the system 15 times.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s admission that such a huge error was not caught during testing has raised serious questions about its internal processes and safeguards.\n\nTrending: Rory McIlroy\u2019s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 \u2014 here\u2019s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100\n\nHistory Repeating Itself\n\nThis incident has brought George Kurtz\u2019s past into sharp focus. In 2010, as McAfee\u2019s CTO, Kurtz was at the helm during another significant tech failure. The problem was eerily similar, and the fallout was substantial, with McAfee facing severe criticism and a loss of customer trust.\n\nSince Thursday, the day before the outage, CrowdStrike stock has lost around 21% of its value, and Kurtz\u2019s net worth plummeted from $3.2 billion to $2.6 billion on Wednesday, the 24th, according to Forbes.\n\nGiven this history, many are now wondering how Kurtz, with all his experience, let something like this happen again at CrowdStrike. The company has promised to investigate thoroughly to determine how the mistake happened and to implement measures to prevent it. However, fixing the damage to its reputation might take a while.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWhen today\u2019s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them \u2014 here\u2019s how not to get left out.

        "content": "When your reputation is in tatters, being able to pull your company up out of the ashes takes a Herculean effort.\u00a0Certainlyit is not easy.\u00a0As\u00a0Warren Buffett once said, \u201cIt takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you will do things differently.\u201d Some companies\u00a0apparently\u00a0never thought about it.\n\nArthur Anderson had been a respected accounting firm with decades of service but its complicity in the Enron and Worldcom scandals damaged it beyond repair. Its conviction on obstruction of justice charges (eventually overturned) eventually caused it to cease operations.\n\nOn the other hand,\u00a0Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) showed that it can be done. The consumer health giant\u2019s reputation was in tatters after cyanide-laced Tylenol caused the death of several people in Chicago in the 1980s. Although it was the work of a psychopath, Johnson & Johnson pulled all Tylenol bottles everywhere from the shelves. It also halted all manufacturing and marketing and offered to replace all bottles already purchased by the public with solid tablets. The incident led to changes in how medicine\u00a0is packaged\u00a0but also showed how a company could respond to save itself and its brand from ruination.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSeveral controversial stocks today are dealing with reputational fallout from their actions. Whether they can ever fully recover remains to be seen. With their stocks trading at significant discounts, let\u2019s\u00a0take a closer\u00a0look to see if they are worth investing in.\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) Bud Light Beer 36 pack beer cans display at grocery store.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the surface,\u00a0Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) seems like it should eventually rebound\u00a0but\u00a0there is a deeper problem that could mean it is irrevocably damaged.\n\nAmid a secular decline in beer sales, the brewer\u00a0launched a social media campaign last year to reach a younger audience for its Bud Light brand. At the time, the beer was the biggest-selling brand in the country, a position it held for over two decades.\n\nHowever, by featuring a transgender woman on the can at the height of the culture wars, it ignited a protest by conservatives to boycott Bud Light. In the first month following the controversy, Bud Light sales cratered 26%\u00a0andAnheuser-Busch\u2019s overall sales declined 1%. They are still falling today. In\u00a0the four-week period\u00a0ending July 6, Bud Light had\u00a0fallen to third place with just a 6.5% share of the market, half of what it had been. It cost Anheuser-Busch over $1 billion in sales and some $27 billion in brand value.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis\u00a0does seem like something that will fade in time\u00a0and\u00a0BUD says losses have stabilized. Yet\u00a0with\u00a0liberals also upset with Anheuser-Busch backpedaling away from the promotion, lost Bud Light sales may never return.\n\nBUD stock has recovered from the worst of its losses but remains 9% below where it stood before the controversy erupted.\n\nBoeing (BA) image of a Boeing (BA) 737 max aircraft. stocks to buy and sell related to Boeing\n\nSource: Marco Menezes / Shutterstock.com\n\nArguably one of the biggest stories this year\u00a0has been\u00a0the safety record of\u00a0Boeing (NYSE:BA) airplanes.\u00a0Followinga hatch door popping off mid-flight on a Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft,\u00a0a series of\u00a0additional mishaps followed.\u00a0A tire fell off the landing gear, an engine caught fire, an external panel fell off and\u00a0there have been\u00a0hydraulic system problems.\u00a0They all occurred in the span of a few weeks.\n\nSince then, whistleblowers have\u00a0come forward to say\u00a0Boeing and its parts supplier\u00a0Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR) play fast and loose with safety. It got so bad that Boeing will acquire Spirit in a $4.7 billion deal to have greater oversight. Airlines are now looking elsewhere for planes to buy. Boeing also\u00a0just\u00a0agreed to pay a $244 million fine and spend at least $455 million over the next three years to boost safety and compliance programs.\n\nYet\u00a0as\u00a0I noted earlier this month, commercial aircraft is only half of Boeing\u2019s business. It is also a\u00a0major\u00a0defense contractor responsible for some of the most important military aircraft, including the President\u2019s Air Force One. Because it is one of only two major commercial aircraft manufacturers along with the U.K.\u2019s BAE Systems(OTCMKTS:BAESY), and it is so critical to military aviation, it cannot be allowed to fail. I wrote, \u201cIts low point now represents an opportunity to buy an undervalued defense contractor.\u201d\n\nBoeing stock is down 30% in 2024 and is cheap enough to buy into now.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last of the controversial stocks is\u00a0Crowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD).\u00a0Its \u201cscandal\u201d just occurred on July 18 when the independent cybersecurity outfit accidentally uploaded a bug into a software patch. The cascading series of events\u00a0that followed\u00a0caused IT systems globally to crash.\n\nMultinational corporations, major\u00a0tech stocks and\u00a0government agencies worldwide saw their computer operations bricked. For a company tasked with cybersecurity responsibilities, causing such mass outages is not a good look. Crowdstrike stock collapsed 25% in the aftermath. It traded north of $343 the day before the crash and now goes for $258.\n\nYet\u00a0Wall Street remains upbeat on Crowdstrike. It believes this is just a passing issue for the controversial stock. Because it didn\u2019t involve a hack of the company\u2019s systems and a loss of data but was\u00a0rather\u00a0a human error issue, analysts believe Crowdstrike can recover.\n\nIt is likely rivals will\u00a0use the problem to take some\u00a0market share from Crowdstrike.\u00a0Its stock may also languish for some time to see what the financial hit will be to its business. But companies have bounced back from such \u201cfat finger\u201d disasters before and CRWD stock should\u00a0as well.\n\nOn\u00a0the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in JNJ stock.

As the host of CNBC's \u201cMad Money,\u201d he\u2019s known for his high-energy stock recommendations. Less than two months ago, however, Cramer was very optimistic about CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), a leading cybersecurity company. But, recent events have shown just how unpredictable the stock market can be, even for experts.\n\nCrowdstrike now -30% in just a month since Jim praised it.

He pointed out that the company had consistently performed well since it went public, never missing an earnings quarter. He highlighted the strong leadership of CEO George Kurtz and was confident that CrowdStrike would keep doing well despite challenges in the enterprise software sector. \"I don't think that Domino is going to fall,\" he confidently stated, making it clear he believed in the company's bright future\u200b.\n\nHowever, things went south when CrowdStrike created a global IT outage because of a faulty software update. This disruption affected millions of Microsoft computers and countless businesses. It also caused CrowdStrike's stock to drop by 11% initially and up to 24% later. Although CEO George Kurtz quickly took responsibility and explained that the problem was an internal issue, not a security breach, all the affected computers had to be fixed manually.\n\nCrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts.

He also attributed the stock\u2019s drop to \u201cbad luck,\u201d mentioning an unrelated Microsoft Azure outage that worsened things. He reassured viewers that the problem was just a sloppy update, not a flaw in CrowdStrike's core technology, and predicted a quick recovery for the company as confidence in its capabilities returned\u200b, saying, \"The fact is that it was just an update, it was not a hack.

        "content": "CrowdStrike CRWD has been one of the most prolific security software providers in recent times thanks to its Falcon platform. However, a faulty Falcon update on Jul 19 resulted in a global IT outage. CRWD shares dropped 11% on Jul 19 and have been on a downward spiral since then.\r\n\r\nThe blue screen of death (BSOD) outage reportedly impacted 8.5 million Windows machines. In its preliminary Post Incident Review (PIR), CRWD has blamed the BSOD outage on a bug in the Rapid Response Content, which somehow went undetected during validation checks.\r\n\r\nLosses from the massive IT outage are now expected between $400 million and $1.5 billion, per cyber analytics firm Cybercube, as cited by Reuters. Insurer Parametrix estimates insured losses between $540 million and $1.08 billion for Fortune 500 companies, excluding Microsoft.\r\n\r\nApart from the staggering losses, recovery from the IT outage is expected to take several days. CRWD\u2019s software runs at the kernel level of a computer, which helps it to detect cyberattacks more efficiently. However, computers affected by the bug are required to be rebooted manually to safe mode by an administrator and then delete the affected file. This is expected to be a time-consuming process. \r\n\r\nThe incident has significantly impacted CrowdStrike\u2019s reputation and brand value. CRWD is taking correctional measures as per the PIR, including enhanced software testing procedures, as well as a plan to conduct validation exercises through third-party. However, prospects don\u2019t look bright as the reputational damage can result in customer exodus, thereby hurting top-line growth.\r\n\r\nSince the incident, CRWD shares have declined more than 15%. Year-to-date, shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have gained 1.1%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 18.6%.\n\nYTD Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\n3 Better Bets Than CRWD Stock\n\nHere, we have picked three security stocks that are better bets than CrowdStrike. These stocks have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\u00a0\r\n\r\nPer the Zacks proprietary methodology, stocks with this favorable combination offer good investment opportunities.\r\n\r\nOkta OKTA is benefiting from an expanding clientele, driven by the strong adoption of its Identity Threat Protection solution. It exited the first quarter of fiscal 2025 with the total customer count increasing 6% year over year to 19,100.\r\n\r\nOkta\u2019s expanding portfolio has been a key catalyst. Its Okta AI, a suite of AI-powered capabilities embedded across both Workforce Identity Cloud and Customer Identity Cloud, empowers organizations to harness the power of AI to build better experiences and protect against cyberattacks.\r\n\r\nFor fiscal 2025, Okta expects revenues between $2.53 billion and $2.54 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 12%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $2.53 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.91%.\r\n\r\nOKTA expects fiscal 2025 non-GAAP earnings between $2.35 and $2.40 per share.

        "content": "Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike is facing new criticism after offering a ten dollar UberEats voucher as an apology for the major global IT outage last week which grounded flights and cancelled medical appointments.\n\nA flawed software update from the company impacted around 8.5 million Windows computers worldwide last Friday, bringing businesses and infrastructure to a standstill.\n\nNow the company has been criticised for sending an email to staff and some partners thanking them for their work to help fix the issue which told recipients: \u201cTo express our gratitude, your next cup of coffee or late night snack is on us!\u201d. Passengers queue at Birmingham Airport during the IT outage (Jacob King/PA)\n\nThe gesture has been widely mocked on social media, with some suggesting the offer of a cup of coffee did not make up for the thousands of hours of lost work time and the damage done to public trust in the firm.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe scheme has also been blighted by some reporting being unable to redeem the code, with CrowdStrike admitting that Uber later flagged the offering as fraud \u201cbecause of high usage rates\u201d.\n\nThe offer does not appear to have extended to CrowdStrike customers impacted by the outage.\n\nIt comes as questions remain over whether any financial compensation will be due to CrowdStrike customers because of the outage, but the cybersecurity firm has pledged to improve its software testing procedures in the wake of the incident.\n\nIn a published review of the outage, CrowdStrike said a bug in its system meant \u201cproblematic content data\u201d in a software update file was missed.\n\nThe US firm has also been asked to schedule an appearance before Congress, with chief executive George Kurtz asked to give evidence about the incident to US legislators.",

        "title": "Intuitive Surgical and Hooker Furnishings have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 25, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Intuitive Surgical, Inc. ISRG as the Bull of the Day and Hooker Furnishings Corp. HOFT as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on CrowdStrike CRWD, Microsoft MSFT and Palo Alto Networks PANW.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nIntuitive Surgical, Inc. is back to its winning ways as da Vinci procedures continue to grow worldwide. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to see 14% revenue growth in 2024 and 16% in 2025.\r\n\r\nIntuitive Surgical manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system globally. It strives to make surgery more effective, less invasive and easier on surgeons, patients and their families. As of June 30, 2024, its da Vinci surgical system installed base grew to 9,203 systems.\r\n\r\nAnother Earnings Beat in the Second Quarter\r\n\r\nOn July 18, 2024, Intuitive Surgical reported second quarter 2024 results and beat on the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.25. Earnings were $1.78 versus the consensus of $1.53.\r\n\r\nIt was the 6th earnings beat in a row.\r\n\r\nThe pandemic was a difficult time for the company as surgical procedures plunged worldwide. But that impact has receded.\r\n\r\nWorldwide da Vinci procedures grew 17% year-over-year in the second quarter. It placed 341 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 331 last year.\r\n\r\nRevenue rose 14% to $2.01 billion from $1.76 billion last year driven by growth in da Vinci procedure volume and an increase in the installed base of systems.\r\n\r\nThe Company finished the second quarter with $7.68 billion in cash, up $360 million.\r\n\r\nAnalysts Bullish on 2024 and 2025\r\n\r\nNo surprise that the analysts are bullish on Intuitive Surgical. 10 estimates were revised higher in the last week for both 2024 and 2025.\r\n\r\nThe 2024 Zacks Consensus Estimate jumped to $6.62 from $6.26. That is earnings growth of 16% from 2023 as the company made $5.71 last year.\r\n\r\nThey are bullish on 2025 as well. 10 estimates were also revised higher for 2025 in the last week. The Zacks Consensus rose to $7.60 from $7.32, or another 14.8% earnings growth.\r\n\r\nHere's what this strong earnings growth looks like on the price and consensus chart.\n\nShares at All-Time Highs\r\n\r\nIntuitive Surgical went IPO in 2000. The stock has been one of the top performers over the last 24 years and recently hit new all-time highs.\n\nIt's not a value stock. Intuitive Surgical trades at 68x earnings.\r\n\r\nBut for investors looking for growth, Intuitive Surgical, with its double digit revenue and earnings growth, should be on your short list.\n\nStory continues\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nHooker Furnishings Corp. continues to focus on execution during this sustained downturn in the furniture industry. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see a big decrease in earnings in fiscal 2025.\r\n\r\nHooker Furnishings is celebrating its 100th year of business this year. It is a designer, marketer and importer of casegoods (wooden and metal furniture), leather furniture, fabric-upholstered furniture, lighting, accessories and home decor for the residential, hospitality and contract markets.\r\n\r\nThe company's corporate offices and manufacturing facilities are located in Virginia, North Carolina and California. It has showrooms in High Point, NC, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. It also operates distribution centers in Virginia, Georgia and Vietnam.\r\n\r\nHooker Furnishings also sells online.\r\n\r\nA Big Miss in the First Quarter of Fiscal 2025\r\n\r\nOn June 6, 2024, Hooker Furnishings reported its fiscal 2025 first quarter results and missed on the Zacks Consensus by $0.36. Earnings were a loss of $0.39 versus the consensus of a loss of $0.03.\r\n\r\nIt was the second miss in a row.\r\n\r\nNet sales fell 23.2% to $93.6 million year-over-year. All three of its reporting segments experienced a decline in sales driven mostly by the continued weak demand for home furnishings.\r\n\r\nYear-over-year, industry-wide US furniture store sales fell compared to the prior year same months for the 14th consecutive month.\r\n\r\nBalance Sheet and Dividend\r\n\r\nThe company is focused on maintaining a healthy financial position and balance sheet while the downturn in the industry continues. After all, Hooker didn't get to 100 years in business without navigating challenging economic conditions.\r\n\r\nIt has $41 million in cash on hand and inventory levels are well-aligned to current demand. They have actually come down $5.2 million to $56.6 million compared to $61.8 million three months prior, which was at the end of the fiscal year.\r\n\r\n\"Given the uncertainty in the furniture industry and the general economy, we remain committed to our capital allocation policy. Our short-term capital allocation strategy is focused on preserving capital until we begin to see an industry-turnaround, while also protecting our 50-plus year history of quarterly dividends and continuing to invest in organic growth,\" said Chief Financial Officer, Paul Huckfeldt.\r\n\r\n\"We believe we have a conservative balance sheet, which can help us weather the current demand environment\", he continued, \"but understand the need for caution in a cyclical industry like ours,\" he added.\r\n\r\nEarnings Estimates Were Cut\r\n\r\nGiven the tough industry conditions, it's not a surprise that the earnings estimates have been cut.\r\n\r\nOne estimate was cut for fiscal 2025 in the last 60 days but it took the Zacks Consensus down to $0.09 from $1.10. That's a decline of 90.1% as Hooker made $0.91 last year.\r\n\r\nShares Near 5-Year Lows\r\n\r\nShares of Hooker soared during the pandemic as furniture sales also soared. But the party ended in 2021 and the stock has struggled.\r\n\r\nIt's trading near 5-year lows.\r\n\r\nBut is it cheap?\r\n\r\nWith the cutting of earnings estimates, Hooker still has a high forward P/E of 171.\r\n\r\nThe company is committed to its dividend, however. That is yielding 5.96%.\r\n\r\nBut investors might want to wait for the furniture industry to see some green shoots before jumping in on Hooker Furnishings.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nIs CrowdStrike a Buy Here?\n\nCrowdStrike, a leader in next-generation endpoint protection, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services, has been at the forefront of headlines following a global IT outage that halted many aspects of the economy and affected many Microsoft Windows devices.\n\nIt's been a rough few days for the stock, reflective of the incident. But is the move a buying opportunity, or should investors stay on the sidelines until we learn more? Let's take a closer look.\n\nCrowdStrike Plunges\n\nThe recent move has pushed valuation multiples down, with shares currently trading at a 14.3X forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio compared to a 23.8X high just this year. The company is forecasted to see 30% sales growth in its current fiscal year, though it's critical to note that these expectations will likely be adjusted following the fiasco.\n\nIn addition, Guggenheim Securities, BTIG, and Scotiabank all downgraded their ratings for the stock from 'Strong Buy' to 'Hold' just this week, again reflecting the potential negative ramifications.\n\nMicrosoft released a statement following the incident, stating, 'While software updates may occasionally cause disturbances, significant incidents like the CrowdStrike event are infrequent. We currently estimate that CrowdStrike's update affected 8.5 million Windows devices, or less than one percent of all Windows machines. While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services.'\n\nWhile the recent dip is certainly appetizing, given the company's established nature and pure size, investors should wait on the sidelines until the situation becomes clearer. In addition, its current Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) rating alludes to further near-term share pressure.\n\nCompetition Looks to Pounce\n\nGiven the recent development, several cybersecurity stocks could see some beneficial tailwinds, such as Palo Alto Networks. The company's current year outlook has remained bullish, with the $5.57 per share expected up 12% over the last year.\n\nPalo Alto Networks' sales growth is also expected to remain strong, forecasted to jump 16% in its current fiscal year. The stock has remained on a strong growth trajectory, posting double-digit percentage year-over-year revenue growth rates in each of its last ten quarterly releases.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe recent CrowdStrike fiasco that brought down Microsoft devices has certainly brought about some headwinds for the stock, plunging following the incident.\n\nWhile the rough price action could be seen as a buying opportunity among some, the company's cloudy earnings outlook, reflected by its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) alludes to further share pressure in the near term. Instead, investors should pivot to stocks enjoying positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nFurther, we could be in the early stages of the incident, with the overall impact not yet fully understood. A rival, Palo Alto Networks, could see buying pressure given its competitive nature with CrowdStrike.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "While the cybersecurity industry has generally been a bastion of strength in the tech sector, not all stocks are created equal. Despite the rising threats that drive demand for digital protection, some companies in this space are showing signs of weakness that could lead to significant declines in their stock prices.\n\nInvestors often flock to cybersecurity stocks as they represent a growing need in an increasingly digital world. As of 2023, the market is valued at $222 billion and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.3%, reaching approximately $500 billion by 2030. The increasing prevalence of cyber-attacks, driven by the widespread use of e-commerce platforms, smart devices, and cloud technologies, is a key factor fueling this market growth.\n\nAlthough the overall market is expected to continue its robust growth momentum, investors\u2019 enthusiasm can sometimes lead to overvaluation or overlook the fundamental issues that some companies might face.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor those looking to safeguard their investments, stepping back from certain high-risk cybersecurity stocks before the end of July might be wise. Here are three such stocks showing troubling signs that investors should consider divesting to avoid potential losses.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leader in cloud-delivered endpoints and cloud workload protection. However, recent events and the company\u2019s current valuation suggest it may be time for investors to consider selling their stakes.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s stock has faced significant challenges recently due to a technical glitch that caused a global IT outage. This incident has raised concerns about the company\u2019s software reliability and potential financial liabilities from disrupted businesses worldwide. Despite the company\u2019s rapid response to deploy a fix, the fallout could impact its reputation and financials.\n\nMoreover, despite strong historical performance, CrowdStrike\u2019s valuation raises concerns. The company\u2019s stock trades at a forward PE 346x, significantly higher than the industry average. This premium valuation comes amid a backdrop where other leading cybersecurity firms are trading at much lower multiples.\n\nThe cybersecurity market is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Companies like Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet continue to expand their offerings, potentially squeezing CrowdStrike\u2019s competitive edge and forcing it to invest heavily in sales and marketing to retain its leadership position.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is experiencing significant challenges that are impacting its market performance and operational dynamics. Over the last 12 months, Fortinet\u2019s stock has declined 25%, with flat returns over the past three years, marking a stark underperformance relative to its peers.\n\nThe primary concern for Fortinet has been the declining sales of its firewall products. This trend, which began manifesting in mid-2023, has continued into 2024, adversely affecting the company\u2019s consolidated results and investor sentiment.\n\nFortinet\u2019s financial health has shown signs of strain. The company\u2019s revenue growth has decelerated significantly, with forecasts suggesting a continuation of this trend. Analyst consensus reflects a decline in expected EPS growth. This slowdown is a critical red flag, indicating potential long-term growth issues, particularly as the company faces stiff competition from pure-play cloud providers like CrowdStrike and hybrid competitors like Palo Alto Networks.\n\nMoreover, Fortinet\u2019s current valuation does not adequately reflect the risks associated with its slowing growth and operational challenges. The stock trades at a premium compared to some of its peers, which is hard to justify given the company\u2019s underwhelming revenue growth projections and ongoing strategic misalignments.\n\nCyberArk (CYBR) Cyberark (CYBR) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nCyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) is an identity security company that faces several challenges, including intense competition, market saturation, and high stock valuation.\n\nAs of the latest market close, CyberArk\u2019s shares are trading at a premium, fueled mainly by its past performance and market optimism surrounding its subscription-based revenue model. While the company\u2019s recent growth is commendable, the current valuation has made the forward PE ratio hard to justify, even with the company\u2019s robust growth narrative.\n\nCyberArk faces fierce competition from larger players like Microsoft and Palo Alto Networks, which have deeper pockets and broader product ecosystems. Additionally, while strategically sound, the company\u2019s focus on identity security directly competes with newer market entrants that might offer more innovative solutions or more aggressive pricing strategies. The threat from these disruptive technologies and business models could undermine CyberArk\u2019s competitive position and erode its market share.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohammed Saqib did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Why CrowdStrike's Outage May Ultimately Benefit Its Stock",
        "content": "Until recently, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) stock was trading at record highs. The success of its endpoint security product was driving greater use of its Falcon platform -- and more interest from investors, who had pushed its valuation to stratospheric levels.\n\nHowever, investors began to question their thesis after a software update for its Microsoft-based systems led to a massive global IT outage. Amid the fallout, CrowdStrike stock dropped 11% on Friday and another 13% in Monday's trading session.\n\nYet despite the market's now-bleaker view of the company, this experience may ultimately benefit CrowdStrike shareholders.\n\nCrowdStrike stock after the outage\n\nTo put it simply, established CrowdStrike shareholders may come out ahead because the buying opportunity that this debacle has created will lead more investors into the stock. The stock dropped approximately 35% over the course of just nine trading sessions, so investors who had been holding out for a lower price may decide that now is the time to buy.\n\nMoreover, history shows that companies that address such issues tend to win back the confidence of investors over time.\n\nFor example, CrowdStrike peer Palo Alto Networks lost 28% of its value when investors turned against its business strategy in February after the company delivered its fiscal Q2 2024 earnings report. However, Fortune Business Insights has forecast a 14% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the cybersecurity industry through 2032. The prospect of steadily rising demand for cybersecurity appears to have rescued Palo Alto -- the stock is now down by only around 10% since the day before that February earnings report.\n\nA similar updraft could buoy CrowdStrike stock over time. Assuming management moves quickly to rectify this mistake, investors will again focus on industry growth trends, which should eventually bode well for the company.\n\nThe state of CrowdStrike stock\n\nDespite its long-term prospects, investors should not try to predict how CrowdStrike stock will perform in the short term.\n\nFor one thing, investors are still processing the extent of the IT outage and its implications. Anything could still happen to the cybersecurity stock in the near term, and as the second trading session since the outage indicated, the selling may not be over.\n\nAdditionally, CrowdStrike stock remains pricey. Since the company only recently transitioned to profitability, investors might be willing to overlook its forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 66 (at this writing). What they might find harder to accept is its price-to-sales ratio of 20. By that metric, it's a significantly more expensive stock than its most direct competitors.\n\nStory continues CRWD PS Ratio Chart\n\nIn this latest period of uncertainty, that multiple could slide even further when accounting for falling revenue growth rates. In its fiscal 2025 first quarter (which ended April 30), CrowdStrike's revenue rose 33% year over year to $921 million.\n\nWhile that is well above the forecast CAGR for its industry, it is slightly below the 36% growth rate the company reported in its fiscal 2024. Additionally, before the outage, the company had forecast revenue for fiscal 2025 of $3.98 billion to $4.01 billion. At the midpoint of that range, its growth rate would be 30%, a factor that could prompt further selling.\n\nHow to invest in CrowdStrike\n\nGiven CrowdStrike's current state, interested investors should consider picking up its shares. The company is a leader in its industry, and it is unlikely that one incident will change that.\n\nHowever, how one buys CrowdStrike stock is meaningful, too. I would suggest that investors should not buy the entire stake they intend to build all at once. If you're interested in adding this stock to your portfolio, now would be an excellent time to start doing so through dollar-cost averaging.\n\nThe massive drop in the second trading session after the outage illustrates why. An investor who made an all-in move on the day of the outage would have been down significantly just 24 hours later. Conversely, those who buy smaller allotments now will own a position even if it recovers rapidly. The dollar-cost averaging approach also allows investors to add more shares with the same amount of capital should prices continue falling, mitigating investor risk during this volatile time.\n\nCrowdStrike stock going forward\n\nUltimately, the company's shareholders may be better off for experiencing this stock price decline. Admittedly, glaring public failures and a lower stock price are not the sorts of things investors crave from the companies they invest in. And if investors wind up dissatisfied with how management responds to this event, the negative reverberations could persist for some time.\n\nHowever, if CrowdStrike effectively adjusts its course, investors who had been waiting on the sidelines now have a lower price. This will allow them to begin dollar-cost averaging, leaving them with a base of support as the market moves on from the outage. Assuming it reclaims its all-time high, the stock could have more shareholders and more demand as the investment case for CrowdStrike continues to improve over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Turnaround AI Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 67% and 93%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Excitement about artificial intelligence drove shares of CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) to record highs earlier this year. But the stocks have since tumbled 31% and 34%, respectively.\n\nCrowdStrike's losses happened quickly, precipitated by a faulty software patch that caused a global IT outage last weekend. Super Micro Computer's losses accumulated gradually following mixed financial results in the March quarter. But certain Wall Street analysts view the stocks as significantly oversold, and they expect shares to rebound sharply.\n\nIn July, Ittai Kidron at Oppenheimer raised his price target on CrowdStrike to $450 per share, citing a robust product pipeline, including a new generative artificial intelligence assistant. His forecast implies 51% upside from its current share price of $263. In April, Ananda Baruah at Loop Capital raised his price target on Supermicro to $1,500 per share, citing increased confidence in its leadership position in artificial intelligence servers. His forecast implies 93% upside from the current share price of $776.\n\nInvestors should never set too much store by price targets, but CrowdStrike and Supermicro warrant further consideration. Read on to learn more.\n\nCrowdStrike: 67% implied upside\n\nCrowdStrike sells about two dozen cybersecurity software products through a single artificial intelligence (AI) platform. The company is best known for its leadership in modern endpoint security, a category concerned with protecting devices like desktops. CrowdStrike captured 21% market share in modern endpoint security software last year, and that figure will approach 24% this year, according to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nLeadership in endpoint security is advantageous because endpoint devices are the primary source of threat intelligence for enterprises. As such, CrowdStrike has a material data advantage that (arguably) makes its AI models uniquely effective in detecting cyberthreats. CEO George Kurtz recently told analysts CrowdStrike has the \"industry's most effective and accurate AI models to prevent attacks.\"\n\nCrowdStrike is also gaining momentum in other markets. Analysts have recognized its prowess in cloud workload security, ITDR (identity threat detection and response), and MDR (managed detection and response). Beyond that, the company has one of the fastest-growing SIEM (security information and event management) products on the market, and its generative AI assistant (Charlotte AI) is gaining traction with customers, according to Kurtz.\n\nLet's talk about the elephant in the room. On July 19, CrowdStrike pushed a defective update that caused millions of machines running the Windows operating system to crash. The massive IT outage disrupted businesses across numerous industries, from banks and airlines to hospitals and 911 call centers. Shares plummeted on the news.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortunately, CrowdStrike responded quickly and effectively. There may be further downside in the near term, such as legal action or difficulty winning new customers. But those headwinds should fade eventually. Malik Ahmed Khan at Morningstar wrote, \"We think the pullback represents a good buying opportunity for long-term investors.\"\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects revenue to increase at 26% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends January 2027). That estimate makes the current valuation of 20 times sales look tolerable. Patient investors comfortable with volatility should consider buying a small position today. The stock may not return 67% over the next year, but I think CrowdStrike can beat the S&P 500 over the next three to five years.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: 93% implied upside\n\nSuper Micro Computer designs and manufactures high-performance computing platforms for data centers, optimized for use cases like data analytics and artificial intelligence. Its portfolio includes complete server and storage solutions, server subsystems like motherboards and chassis, and server management software. The company sources chips from suppliers like Nvidia and AMD.\n\nSupermicro has emerged as a leader in the AI server market due to its internal design competencies and modular approach to product development. Specifically, the company manufactures and assembles most servers internally in Silicon Valley, which enables rapid prototyping and product launches. It also uses common building blocks across product lines, which allows its engineers to quickly build a broad range of products equipped with the latest chips.\n\nSupermicro generally beats competitors to market with new technologies, often by two to six months. Jim Kelleher at Argus believes that advantage cements its leadership in AI severs. \"Supermicro is emerging as a go-to provider for data center implementation of GPU computing infrastructure used in training large language models (LLMs), inference, deep learning, and other elements that enable generative AI applications,\" he wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\nSupermicro reported mixed financial results in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended March 2024). Revenue surged 200% to $3.85 billion, missing the $3.9 billion analysts anticipated. But non-GAAP earnings increased 308% to $6.65 per diluted share, topping the Street consensus of $5.57 per diluted share. Notably, CEO Charles Liang attributed the top-line shortfall to supply constraints, not a lack of demand.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects Supermicro to grow non-GAAP earnings at 41% annually through fiscal 2026 (ends June 2026). That estimate makes the current valuation of 40.5 times non-GAAP earnings look quite reasonable. Investors should consider buying a small position in Supermicro today, but not with the expectation of a 93% return in the next 12 months. There is no guarantee the bears are done selling.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "On Friday, a flawed update from U.S. cybersecurity company CrowdStrike crashed Windows PCs all over the world, with computers displaying the dreaded \"blue screen of death.\" The outage hit global airlines particularly hard, disrupting thousands of flights as staff scrambled to get systems back online. Some airlines, like U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines, are still struggling.\n\nTony Fernandes, CEO of Capital A, owner of low-cost carrier AirAsia, says he's \"100%\" asking for compensation from Microsoft, the developer of the Windows operating system.\n\n\"If I delay my flight, you would come after me for a refund, right? Or if I cancel my flight, it means I need to give you a refund,\" Fernandes told reporters at an event in Subang, Malaysia.\n\n\"The principle is if we do something wrong, we have to compensate. They did something wrong. We and other airlines lost a lot,\" he said.\n\nTotal financial losses from the CrowdStrike outage could reach as high as $15 billion, insurer Parametrix estimated on Wednesday. The cost to Fortune 500 companies alone could be over $5 billion.\n\nMalaysia's digital minister has also chimed in. On Wednesday, Gobind Singh Deo suggested to reporters that five government agencies and nine companies were among those affected in Malaysia, and that he'd met with representatives from Microsoft and CrowdStrike to seek a full report, according to Reuters.\n\nServices at Asian airports needed to be done manually when the outage first hit on Friday, with passengers facing delays at both Singapore's Changi Airport and the Hong Kong International Airport. The outage affected services at over 10 airlines in Singapore and at least five in Hong Kong, according to local media reports.\n\nAirlines are still picking up the pieces from Friday's outage. Delta is still cancelling hundreds of flights, with over 6,000 flight cancellations since the outage began. It's the worst affected among the major U.S. carriers, and is now being probed by the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nFernandes has been on the warpath regarding Microsoft and CrowdStrike since the outage. On Sunday, the airline executive complained in a LinkedIn post that \"tech companies have little empathy\" for what airlines went through during the pandemic.\n\n\"Now they have issues they expect us all to understand. Well, I'm not going to. Airlines need answers and compensation,\" he wrote.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Trustworthy Dividend Stocks to Steadily Build Your Portfolio",
        "content": "Arguably, there\u2019s never a bad time to consider trustworthy dividend stocks. By securing passive income, you can complement any returns you generate through speculation. Also, by having dividend-paying companies in your portfolio, you stand a better chance of ending up in positive territory. These factors may become even more critical at this present juncture.\n\nOver the weekend, President Joe Biden announced that he would no longer seek reelection. Instead, he will focus on finishing out his term. This massive \u2013 though not entirely unexpected \u2013 paradigm shift presents huge uncertainties for the market. Prior to the announcement, the consensus view appeared that former President Donald Trump had an easier road back to the White House.\n\nNow, the situation got murkier. Adding to the pressure, geopolitical tensions and flashpoints are blaring. This means that the American electorate must choose their leadership wisely. Basically, the decision will likely come down to a few key swing states. With uncertainty in the air, it\u2019s time to consider these trustworthy dividend stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrankly, it doesn\u2019t get much more trustworthy than semiconductor giant Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). With innovation moving at breakneck speed, the company\u2019s relevance has only increased. Therefore, even though AVGO wobbly in recent sessions, it still ranks among the top trustworthy dividend stocks to buy.\n\nIn terms of pure generosity, Broadcom doesn\u2019t exactly impress, providing a forward dividend yield of 1.3%. Also, the payout ratio is quite high at 84.88%. Nevertheless, you won\u2019t find too many investors questioning the yield\u2019s sustainability. That\u2019s because the company has been delivering the goods financially. In the past four quarters, it posted an average earnings per share of $1.09, beating the consensus view of $1.06.\n\nSure, AVGO stock trades at a premium at 16.99X trailing-year sales. That\u2019s well above the 11.44X metric seen between the first quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024. However, context matters. By year\u2019s end, analysts believe that sales may jump to $51.46 billion. That\u2019s up 43.7% from last year\u2019s haul of $35.82 billion. Thus, AVGO is one of the trustworthy dividend stocks to consider.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) A photo of bottles of Tide detergent from Procter & Gamble (PG) on a store shelf.\n\nSource: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com\n\nWhen it comes to trustworthy dividend stocks, few resoundingly earn the title quite like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). A household goods giant, people use P&G products every day. Now, it\u2019s not the most exciting and innovative enterprise. But what it lacks in outright growth potential, it makes up for with business predictability. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about when talking about passive income.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 2.39%. The payout ratio is a bit elevated at 61.48% but it arguably falls under the reasonable range. Again, I don\u2019t think investors are worried about yield sustainability as the company features a predictable business. Plus, it consistently beats its bottom-line targets, generating an earnings surprise of 6.55% in the past year.\n\nBetween Q1 2023 to Q1 2024, PG\u2019s price-to-sales ratio sat at 4.42X. Most recently, this metric increased to just under 5X. That might seem problematic to some market participants. However, analysts project steady growth in the years ahead, to $84.31 billion in 2024 (up 2.8%) and $86.94 billion in 2025 (up 3.1%).\n\nHome Depot (HD) Home Depot (HD) storefront on a sunny day\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn many ways, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is akin to a government agency. Of course, it\u2019s a private enterprise. However, when things go wrong \u2013 such as inclement weather \u2013 Home Depot stores stay open, so long as it\u2019s safe to do so. This initiative allows troubled homeowners to buy necessary and critical equipment to (literally) weather the storm.\n\nJust by this corporate ethos alone, HD ranks among the most trustworthy dividend stocks. If you want to talk actual numbers, the home-improvement retailer provides a forward yield of 2.48%. The payout ratio sits at a very reasonable 57.1%. While it\u2019s not the most generous source of passive income, investors can bank on this every quarter.\n\nStacked against the retail cyclical sector, HD stock is pricey. Right now, shares trade at 2.38X trailing-year sales. That said, in the past year, this metric sat at 2.1X. In other words, Home Depot isn\u2019t trading for much of a premium relative to what the market typically bears.\n\nFurther, by year\u2019s end, covering experts anticipate revenue to hit $159 billion. That\u2019s up 4.1% from last year\u2019s print of $152.67 billion. And next year can ring up $166.24 billion on the top line.\n\nIron Mountain (IRM) Iron Mountain (IRM) logo on truck\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStructured as a real estate investment trust or REIT, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) specializes in information management services. Historically, the company was best known for physical document and asset storage. That\u2019s still part of the company\u2019s overall offerings. Further, with the CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) system outage fresh in people\u2019s memory, the storage business may have gotten a branding boost.\n\nAttractively, IRM also ranks as one of the most trustworthy dividend stocks. Presently, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 2.6%. Now, the payout ratio is sky high so that\u2019s one thing to monitor. However, it should also be stated that REITs generally run a much hotter payout ratio than non-REIT enterprises.\n\nInterestingly, IRM stock trades at a 5.21X trailing-year sales multiple. That\u2019s actually lower than the sector median 6.45X. Even better, experts believe that by the end of the year, Iron Mountain can generate revenue of $6.11 billion. That\u2019s up 11.5% from 2023\u2019s tally of $5.48 billion. In the following year, sales may hit $6.68 billion, up 9.4%.\n\nCombined with the potential interest in \u201canalog\u201d security, IRM is one of the trustworthy dividend stocks to consider.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nPharmaceutical giant AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) makes a solid case for trustworthy dividend stocks. Unless you envision a future where society no longer searches for solutions for vexing conditions and diseases, AbbVie should enjoy perpetual relevance. Specifically, the company\u2019s acquisition of Allergan should bolster its long-term appeal. Basically, with Botox under its wing, AbbVie can serve the social media generation\u2019s members as they grow older.\n\nAnother attractive component of ABBV stock is the underlying dividend. With a forward yield of 3.57%, it\u2019s quite generous. Further, the payout ratio of 51.12% is very reasonable. Not only that, AbbVie enjoys 52 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. The pharmaceutical firm was spun off from Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT).\n\nTo be sure, not everything about AbbVie is attractive. Notably, the stock trades at 5.66X, which is very high for the industry. Also, it\u2019s at a premium over the prior year\u2019s average of 4.95X. That said, analysts see slow but steady growth over the next two years. Sales may rise to $55.23 billion in 2024 (up 1.7%) and to $58.84 billion in 2025 (up 6.5%).\n\nWilliams Companies (WMB) The Williams Companies (WMB) logo displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nA midstream energy firm, Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB) specializes in the segment of the hydrocarbon value chain involving transportation and storage. Anytime in the news you hear stories about pipelines, that\u2019s part of the midstream segment. Obviously, Williams plays a vital role in national infrastructure. As such, it\u2019s a key component of the economy.\n\nArguably by default, WMB ranks among the most trustworthy dividend stocks. It basically comes down to the indelible nature of the midstream business. Further, what makes Williams so attractive is the forward yield of 4.24%. Now, the payout ratio is elevated at 74.49%. However, this metric is excusable because of the generation predictability of midstream operations.\n\nTo be fair, WMB stock trades at a premium to sales of 5.16X. In the past year, the metric sat at 3.72X. So, the idea has definitely gotten pricier. That said, analysts see revenue rising to $10.47 billion by year\u2019s end. If so, that would imply a growth rate of 5.2%. In the following year, sales may soar to $11.57 billion, up 10.6%.\n\nWith midstream operators typically enjoying long-term contracts, WMB is one of the trustworthy dividend stocks to consider.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSaving what may be the best for last, Realty Income (NYSE:O) deserves special attention among trustworthy dividend stocks. Structured as a REIT, Realty generates cash flow from long-term net lease agreements with commercial clients. Many of these clients include retailers of necessary goods and services, such as home-improvement stores and pharmacies.\n\nNo matter what\u2019s going on with the broader economy, people will need access to critical goods. That\u2019s why Realty makes fundamental sense. Another reason is the payout profile. First, the REIT is generous with a forward yield of 5.48%. Second, the payout cycle is monthly, not quarterly. Therefore, with enough exposure to O stock, you can conceivably pay off your bills with dividends \u2013 nice!\n\nNow, Realty isn\u2019t perfect. One factor to consider is the sky-high valuation, trading at 9.65X trailing-year sales. However, this is a discount relative to the prior year\u2019s metric of 10.05X.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts see sales hitting just over $5 billion. If so, that would imply a growth rate of 23.2%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "CrowdStrike Admits Bug Caused Massive Global IT Outages\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) has acknowledged that a bug in its safety mechanism caused last week's massive global IT outages.\n\nThe issue stemmed from a flawed data update that led to widespread disruptions, affecting Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows systems worldwide, reported Bloomberg.\n\nThis incident impacted crucial operations in airlines, banking, and stock exchanges across multiple countries.\n\nSystems were compromised for hours, leaving bankers in Hong Kong, doctors in the U.K., and emergency responders in New Hampshire unable to access vital programs.\n\nMicrosoft stated that over 8.5 million Windows users were affected. Although fixes were deployed and many systems have been restored, the incident's scale was unprecedented.\n\nAccording to CrowdStrike's preliminary post-incident review, an error in a Rapid Response Content configuration update went undetected, causing widespread crashes.\n\nThe company regularly issues these updates to enhance security measures against malicious activities based on customer policy configurations.\n\nCrowdStrike plans to improve testing of Rapid Response Content by implementing a new check to fix the faulty Content Validator.\n\nAlso Read: Cathie Wood's Ark Invest Snaps Up $5.3M In Beaten-Down Crowdstrike Shares\n\nAdditionally, the company will adopt staggered, canary deployments to test updates incrementally before a full rollout. Customers will also have more control over the timing and location of future updates.\n\nFollowing the outage, CrowdStrike's shares plummeted nearly 30%, significantly reducing its market value. The U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security has summoned CEO George Kurtz to explain how the company will prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nThe tech outage could cost over $1 billion, but who will foot the bill remains unanswered.\n\nRosenblatt analyst Catharine Trebnick reiterated a Buy rating on the shares and lowered the price target by 16% from $420 to $350.\n\nThe faulty software update has led the analyst to revise the estimate for FY25 and FY26 as the analyst notes that despite the company's swift response and deployment of a fix, the incident's unprecedented scale and disruption across critical industries will undoubtedly have short-term repercussions.\n\nThe analyst sees FY25 revenue of $3.956 billion (previously $4.000 billion), EPS of $3.90 (Previously $4.03) and FY26 revenue of $4.986 billion (previously $5.016 billion), EPS of $4.75 (previously $4.92).\n\nThe shift of resources to customer support and remediation will end in delays in new customer acquisitions and elongated sales cycles, says the analyst.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe analyst expects operational expenses to rise due to remediation efforts, including seeking assistance from Deloitte to address issues with affected companies like Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL), Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ:MAR).\n\nPrice Action: CRWD shares closed lower by 3.99% at $258.14 on Wednesday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCrowdStrike Faces Downgrades Amid Concerns Over Pricing and Renewals Following Disruption\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article CrowdStrike Admits Bug Caused Massive Global IT Outages originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Investing.com - The recent global IT outage caused by a faulty software update at CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) has prompted analysts at Rosenblatt to revise their projections for FY25 and FY26.\n\nDespite the company's swift response and deployment of a fix, the incident's unprecedented scale and disruption across critical industries will undoubtedly have short-term repercussions. This scenario is evidenced by a shift in resource allocation towards customer support and remediation, potentially leading to delays in new customer acquisitions and elongated sales cycles.\n\nFurthermore, CrowdStrike's recent 8-K filing acknowledging an ongoing financial impact evaluation introduces uncertainty into economic models.\n\nRosenblatt views this as a temporary setback in an otherwise strong growth trajectory, supported by the company's solid fundamentals and leading market position. Analysts remain confident in the company's ability to learn from this experience, enhance its quality assurance processes, and emerge as an even more reliable partner for its customers.\n\nThese factors underpin continued confidence in the stock, with Rosenblatt reiterating a Buy rating for Crowdstrike with a price target of $350.\n\nCrowdStrike has actively addressed customer concerns following the IT incident, with Chief Security Officer Shawn Henry directly communicating with customers to rebuild trust. This proactive approach is vital for maintaining customer relationships during this challenging period.\n\nWhile the full financial impact is still uncertain, Rosenblatt has adjusted revenue projections for FY25 and FY26 to account for potential delays in new sales and heightened scrutiny of the platform.\n\nExisting customers may also demand concessions during renewals. CrowdStrike's commitment to customer satisfaction may necessitate compromises on pricing to meet these demands.\n\nOperational expenses are also expected to rise due to remediation efforts, including seeking assistance from Deloitte to address issues with affected companies like Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL), Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ:MAR), and others.\n\nThe CrowdStrike IT incident could also trigger legal action, including class-action lawsuits and individual claims. While CrowdStrike's SLA agreements limit liability, legal costs associated with potential lawsuits and settlements are a concern. The company's insurance coverage and experienced legal team should help mitigate these expenses.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nRosenblatt lowers estimates on CrowdStrike, says long-term thesis intact\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart in Mexico posts Q2 profit boost as sales climb\n\nFord profit disappoints, stock falls 12% as quality issues dog automaker\n\nView comments()",

        "content": "CrowdStrike CRWD, a leader in next-generation endpoint protection, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services, has been at the forefront of headlines following a global IT outage that halted many aspects of the economy and affected many Microsoft MSFT Windows devices.\n\nIt\u2019s been a rough few days for the stock, reflective of the incident. But is the move a buying opportunity, or should investors stay on the sidelines until we learn more? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nCrowdStrike Plunges\n\nThe recent move has pushed valuation multiples down, with shares currently trading at a 14.3X forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio compared to a 23.8X high just this year. The company is forecasted to see 30% sales growth in its current fiscal year, though it\u2019s critical to note that these expectations will likely be adjusted following the fiasco.\n\nIn addition, Guggenheim Securities, BTIG, and Scotiabank all downgraded their ratings for the stock from \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 to \u2018Hold\u2019 just this week, again reflecting the potential negative ramifications.\n\nMicrosoft released a statement following the incident, stating, \u2018While software updates may occasionally cause disturbances, significant incidents like the CrowdStrike event are infrequent. We currently estimate that CrowdStrike\u2019s update affected 8.5 million Windows devices, or less than one percent of all Windows machines. While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services.\u2019\n\nWhile the recent dip is certainly appetizing, given the company\u2019s established nature and pure size, investors should wait on the sidelines until the situation becomes clearer. In addition, its current Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) rating alludes to further near-term share pressure.\n\nCompetition Looks to Pounce\n\nGiven the recent development, several cybersecurity stocks could see some beneficial tailwinds, such as Palo Alto Networks PANW. The company\u2019s current year outlook has remained bullish, with the $5.57 per share expected up 12% over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPalo Alto Networks\u2019 sales growth is also expected to remain strong, forecasted to jump 16% in its current fiscal year. The stock has remained on a strong growth trajectory, posting double-digit percentage year-over-year revenue growth rates in each of its last ten quarterly releases.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company\u2019s sales on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe recent CrowdStrike CRWD fiasco that brought down Microsoft MSFT devices has certainly brought about some headwinds for the stock, plunging following the incident.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the rough price action could be seen as a buying opportunity among some, the company\u2019s cloudy earnings outlook, reflected by its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) alludes to further share pressure in the near term. Instead, investors should pivot to stocks enjoying positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nFurther, we could be in the early stages of the incident, with the overall impact not yet fully understood. A rival, Palo Alto Networks PANW, could see buying pressure given its competitive nature with CrowdStrike.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "CrowdStrike CEO's Net Worth Has Dropped By About $600 Million Since The Global Outage\n\nLast Friday, a major tech outage rocked the world, affecting millions of people and leaving them stranded in airports or, even worse, unable to complete their scheduled operations. The outage could cost over $1 billion, but the question of who will foot the bill remains unanswered.\n\nThis crisis has also severely damaged George Kurtz\u2019s fortune. Kurtz is the CEO of CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity company behind the faulty software update that triggered the outage.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmerica's construction sites are desperate for Robots \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in a house-printing startup who\u2019s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry. Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nBefore the incident, Kurtz\u2019s net worth was more than $3.2 billion, according to Forbes. However, because of the outage, CrowdStrike\u2019s stock price plummeted by more than 21% by Wednesday the 24th, dropping Kurtz\u2019s fortune by about $600 million since Thursday evening, the day before the debacle. At the time of writing, his net worth is around $2.6 billion.\n\nDespite this setback, which happened because most of his wealth is tied up in CrowdStrike stock, George Kurtz remains quite wealthy. As Forbes reports, besides his current CrowdStrike stock, worth about $2.6 billion, he has sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shares over the past few years. Kurtz, who lives in Paradise Valley, Arizona, with his wife and two kids, is also an accomplished race car driver, having won a prestigious Le Mans race in 2019.\n\nTrending:Want to trade futures? Discover why 25 million chose this Chicago Bulls sponsor.\n\nKurtz was born in Parsippany, New Jersey, and wasn\u2019t raised in wealth. He pursued his education in accounting at Seton Hall University, a choice that would lay the foundation for his future in cybersecurity. After graduating, he spent nearly a decade working at Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC) and Ernst & Young, where he found his niche in cybersecurity-related roles.\n\nIn 1999, he launched a security consulting firm, Foundstone, with his former colleagues from Ernst & Young. In 2004, McAfee bought the company for $90 million.\n\nAfter the acquisition, Kurtz joined McAfee as a senior vice president. His talent quickly propelled him to chief technology officer by 2009. In 2010, he played a key role during a huge incident when McAfee released an update that mistakenly deleted a crucial Windows XP file, causing systems to enter a reboot loop and requiring manual repairs, just like last week with CrowdStrike.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith CrowdStrike, the problem started when they sent out a software update for their Falcon Sensor product early Friday morning. This update had a faulty file that ended up crippling millions of Microsoft computers around the world. As a result, devices running Windows were rendered useless, and CrowdStrike had to work quickly to resolve the issue.\n\nRead Next:\n\nGen Z and Millennial millionaires couldn't care less for stocks and bonds \u2014 Here's what they're buying instead.

The incident crashed Microsoft Windows computer systems around the world on Friday, taking down airline, banking and stock exchange operations from Australia and Japan to the UK.\n\nMicrosoft and CrowdStrike rolled out fixes last week, and many systems have been restored. But for several hours, bankers in Hong Kong, doctors in the UK and emergency responders in New Hampshire found themselves locked out of programs critical to keeping their operations afloat. More than 8.5 million Windows users were affected, according to Microsoft.\n\nIn the report, the company said it regularly makes what are known as security content configuration updates, intended to help the company observe, detect or prevent malicious activity, depending on the customer\u2019s policy configuration. A \u201cproblematic Rapid Response Content configuration update\u201d carried an undetected error and crashed Windows systems, the company said in a preliminary post-incident review, published about five days after the incident.\n\nCrowdStrike said it would improve testing of Rapid Response Content in future, in a variety of ways. It said a new check \u201cis in process\u201d in order to fix the faulty Content Validator that failed to vet the problematic content.

The company is developing a flagship version of its AI chips, but specifically for Chinese markets. These chips are anticipated to be hit with US trade restrictions.\n\nOther AI companies\u2013such as CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u2013have contributed to slipping markets for this week as a whole. The company intended to release an update to its \u201cvulnerability-protection\u201d software. However, this was defective on Windows OS devices, causing them to crash. Some companies are still reeling from this hit. Delta (NYSE:DAL) is still facing IT issues that have caused hundreds of flights this week to be delayed or canceled.\n\nNow is the time for investors to buy these AI-stocks on the dip before they continue to rise.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTSMC (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nTSMC (NYSE: TSM) is one of the world\u2019s leading chip manufacturers, known for producing around 90% of all semiconductors worldwide.\u00a0 Some of the company\u2019s biggest clients include Nvidia and Apple.\n\nIn the Q2 earnings call, the company surprised with a revenue of $20.58 billion, surpassing investor expectations by an impressive $491.61 million. The company still has room to grow, supported by the company\u2019s 33.80% YOY increase in revenue. TSMC is trading at a fair value compared to the sector, with a forward P/E ratio of 25.45.\n\nThe primary catalyst for TSMC\u2019s growth is the high demand for AI and smartphone chips. The recent AI boom is set to significantly increase the demand for advanced semiconductor, with more capable services requiring stronger compute power. Additionally, TSMC plans to substantially invest in R&D in order to ensure the company remains the preferred supplier for tech giants.

CrowdStrike routinely sends out software updates for its Falcon product, which is designed to detect and protect against new hacking threats.\n\nHowever, the \u201crapid response\u201d change included a broken file which caused Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system to crash in a so-called blue screen of death.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCrowdStrike admitted it had since uncovered a fault with its \u201ccontent validator\u201d technology, a piece of software that is used to test code before it is sent out to customers, which failed to stop the bug.\n\nIt added that the file tweaked a previous upgrade, which had until that point run smoothly. A broken file caused Microsoft's Windows operating system to crash, resulting in a so-called blue screen of death - David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\n\nThe faulty software was deployed globally to CrowdStrike\u2019s tens of thousands of customers, impacting any machines that were turned on as the changes came online.\n\nThe company spotted the bug and sent out a fixed version 78 minutes later, but by that point millions of PCs had crashed.\n\nThe company said it now planned to \u201cimplement a staggered deployment strategy\u201d for similar changes, rolling them out to only a handful of machines before launching globally \u2013 known in the industry as a \u201ccanary deployment\u201d.\n\nIt also said it planned to provide customers with greater control over how quickly they received these updates.\n\nFriday\u2019s CrowdStrike outage took airlines, train companies, TV broadcasters and NHS systems offline, leading to thousands of flight cancellations and widespread disruption.\n\nCyber security experts have estimated the cost of the bug could run into the billions of pounds, with some describing it as the biggest outage of all time.\n\nCrowdStike, which is listed in the US, has lost more than a fifth of its value since the fault emerged.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bug hit 8.5m computers running on Microsoft\u2019s Windows software. On Monday, the US technology giant blamed European Union rules for forcing it to open up its operating system.\n\nCrowdStrike had so-called \u201cprivileged\u201d access to Windows, meaning it could install deep-lying updates into customers\u2019 computers.\n\nMicrosoft, which offers its own cyber security technology called Windows Defender, said it had been forced to provide this access in a deal with the EU in 2009 amid a competition investigation.\n\nHowever, a European Commission spokesman said: \u201cMicrosoft is free to decide on its business model to adapt its security infrastructure to respond to threats, provided this is done in line with EU competition law.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft has never raised any concerns about security with the commission, either before the recent incident or since.\u201d",

        "content": "By James Pearson\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - A CrowdStrike software update that crashed computers globally last week hitting services from aviation to banking and healthcare was caused by a bug in the U.S. cybersecurity firm's quality control mechanism, the company said on Wednesday.\n\nFriday's outage happened because CrowdStrike's Falcon Sensor, an advanced platform that protects systems from malicious software and hackers, contained a fault that forced computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system to crash and show the \"Blue Screen of Death\".\n\n\"Due to a bug in the Content Validator, one of the two Template Instances passed validation despite containing problematic content data,\" CrowdStrike said in a statement, referring to the failure of an internal quality control mechanism that allowed the problematic data to slip through the company's own safety checks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCrowdStrike did not say what that content data was, nor why it was problematic. A \"Template Instance\" is a set of instructions that guides the software on what threats to look for and how to respond. CrowdStrike said it had added a \"new check\" to its quality control process in a bid to prevent the issue from occurring again.\n\nThe extent of the damage from the botched update is still being assessed. On Saturday, Microsoft said about 8.5 million Windows devices had been affected, and the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee has sent a letter to CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz asking him to testify.\n\nCrowdStrike released information to fix affected systems last week, but experts said getting them back online would take time as it required manually weeding out the flawed code.\n\nWednesday's statement was in line with a widely held assessment from cybersecurity experts that something in CrowdStrike's quality control process had gone badly wrong.\n\n(Reporting by James Pearson; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)",

        "title": "Forget CrowdStrike: 3 Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "CrowdStrike's (NASDAQ: CRWD) stock price tumbled 11% on July 19 after the cybersecurity company's flawed software update for Windows PCs sparked a global IT outage across banks, airports, hospitals, government agencies, retailers, and other businesses. The company says it's already identified the issue and is in the process of rolling back the disastrous update, but it's still too early to assess the long-term damage to its business and brand.\n\nThis seems like a black swan event for CrowdStrike, one of the cybersecurity sector's fastest-growing companies. Its revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 65% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), its stock surged 265% over the past five years, and it now serves about 60% of the Fortune 500 companies. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCrowdStrike should eventually recover and keep growing as its cloud-native endpoint security platform replaces more on-site appliances. But its stock isn't cheap at 19 times this year's sales, and analysts will likely rein in their near-term forecasts. So instead of wondering if CrowdStrike can right its ship without hitting another iceberg, you might instead consider investing in three of its peers: Zscaler(NASDAQ: ZS), Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW), and SentinelOne(NYSE: S).\n\n1. Zscaler\n\nZscaler, like CrowdStrike, is a cloud-native cybersecurity company that doesn't install any on-site appliances. But instead of offering a wide range of security services like CrowdStrike, Zscaler mainly provides \"zero-trust\" services that treat everyone as a potential threat. That approach can stop internal threats like corporate spies and disgruntled employees. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global zero-trust market could still grow at a CAGR of 17% from 2023 to 2030.\n\nZscaler went public in 2018, and its revenue rose at a CAGR of 52% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last July). Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) also grew at a CAGR of 70%.\n\nLike many of its peers, Zscaler has been struggling with slower growth as the macro headwinds made it harder to acquire new customers. But from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts still expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 26% as its adjusted EBITDA increases at a CAGR of 40%. Based on those expectations, its stock doesn't look that expensive at 13 times this year's sales and 56 times its adjusted EBITDA.\n\n2. SentinelOne\n\nSentinelOne aims to disrupt the cybersecurity market with its Singularity extended detection and response (XDR) platform. The company claims Singularity's AI algorithms can completely replace teams of human analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's a bold claim, but SentinelOne has grown like a weed since its public debut in 2021. From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), its revenue rose at a CAGR of 74%. However, its stock has declined nearly 40% below its initial public offering (IPO) price of $35 as the macro and competitive headwinds throttled its near-term growth.\n\nAnalysts still expect its revenue to rise at a CAGR of 27% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 as the macro environment warms up and it expands Singularity's ecosystem. They also expect its adjusted EBITDA to finally turn positive in fiscal 2026. SentinelOne is still a speculative play, but it looks reasonably valued at 7 times this year's sales.\n\n3. Palo Alto Networks\n\nPalo Alto Networks started out as a provider of next-gen firewalls, which added more network filters to traditional firewalls. Today, those on-site firewalls serve as the foundation of its Strata network security platform. However, Palo Alto also provides cloud-based services through its Prisma platform along with AI-powered threat detection tools on its Cortex platform. Most of its growth has been driven by Prisma and Cortex, which it refers to collectively as its \"next-gen security\" (NGS) services.\n\nPalo Alto went public in 2012, and its revenue grew at a CAGR of 35% from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2023 (which ended in July 2023). It now serves more than 80,000 enterprise customers as one of the largest cybersecurity companies in the world. Its growth also slowed down as it faced tougher macro challenges over the past year, but that deceleration was exacerbated by a \"platformization strategy\" driven by free trials and deferred revenue deals for some of its newer services.\n\nBut from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts still expect Palo Alto's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 16% as its earnings per share rises at a CAGR of 49% on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. It might seem a bit pricey at more than 50 times its forward adjusted earnings, but its scale, diversification, and rising profits arguably justify that higher valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "NVIDIA and CrowdStrike have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 23, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares NVIDIA NVDA as the Bull of the Day and CrowdStrike (CRWD) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Amplify Energy Corp. AMPY, Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corp. GLDD and LendingTree, Inc. TREE.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nI last looked at NVIDIA as the Bull of the Day after another stunning beat-and-raise quarter, reported on May 22, launched the stock from $95 ($950 pre-split) to my price target of $140 ($1,400 pre-split).\n\nWe knew the new Grace-Blackwell \"super-GPU\" was coming, but apparently investors and analysts needed to hear it from Jensen himself that the demand and deliveries were going to be off the charts by Q4.\n\nTectonic Shift to AI Economy\n\nThe other huge dynamic we learned on the conference call with Jensen on May 22 essentially put to rest the idea that \"cannibalization\" was about to occur as datacenter and LLM-builders would stop buying older systems like the GH200 because they wanted to wait for the GB200.\n\nHere's what I wrote to my investor group on May 23 as we sat back and enjoyed the rocket launch...\n\nTAZR Traders\n\nYou know the good news on NVDA: Wall Street continues to capitulate to the \"tectonic shift\" that has occurred with AI/ML/DL as more price targets play catch-up to our $1200...\n\nEven as I raise mine to $1400 for the next 18 months.\n\nAnd even as everyone and their Grandpa wring their hands about the NVDA market cap being worth more than half the world.\n\nIf you follow me on Twitter @KevinBCook you got to see the stunning \"chapter and verse\" from Jensen on the conference call yesterday... with all the analysts trying to find a fly in the ointment.\n\nI used Otter.AI to transcribe the whole thing and will share more over the coming days... what a sermon Master Huang delivered!\n\nIt made me coin a new phrase about how he abolished the fear of \"cannibalization\" during this Global 2,000 -- plus nation-states -- deployment transition from GH200 to GB200 systems...\n\n\"Multiplicative Integration.\"\n\nJensen didn't say this, but this is what I felt he was talking about. I actually posted his final 5-paragraph \"mic drop\" because it captured the essence of the technological transformation we are in for science, industry, medicine, education, and society.\n\nJensen & Co. systems have \"the transition\" covered with TCO (total cost of operations) fully seamless -- and bootstrapped -- on the upgrades to the Blackwell platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nCorporations won't have to worry about how the current GH200 systems integrate with the new Blackwell systems because Jensen and his top-tier CUDA engineers have already built that seamless transition into everything.\n\n(end of TAZR commentary excerpt from May 23)\n\nHuang's Law > Moore's Law\n\nThen in the first week of June came the annual Computex conference in Taiwan. And Jensen made it clear that the Acceleration of GPU computing was driving down nearly all Costs, including Energy usage, and providing powerful platforms for Science, Smart cities, and Simulation.\n\nThe oddly capitalized words in my previous sentence make up a new handy acronym I devised for technology investors to memorize when trying to understand the revolution that NVIDIA has birthed: ACESx3 is for Acceleration-Cost-Energy-Science-Smart-Simulation.\n\nThis is how I remember the power of NVIDIA, and the exponential reasons for staying invested in NVDA shares. And all of these letters stand for one of the most powerful ACESx3 innovations for human kind: advances in medicine and cures for our worst diseases.\n\nAfter Computex, and the NVDA 10-for-1 stock split which took effect on June 10, I raised my price target to $200. I had already told investors (and savvy traders) in May that the gap up from $95 ($950 pre-split) was likely never going to be filled (barring WWIII).\n\nHere was my commentary for Zacks TAZR members...\n\nNVDA to $200\r\nPosted on 6/10/24\n\nTAZR Traders\n\nThis morning we taped the Zacks Ultimate Strategy Session (ZUSS).\n\nMy Top Stock Pick was, of course, NVIDIA.\n\nAnd I tried to cram a lot (too much) into my 10-minute segment, but of course got lost along the way.\n\nI neglected to reiterate the emerging potential of Jensen's roadmap to $1 trillion in annual revenues by 2030 (a slide I showed you from last November).\n\nAnd then I forgot to speak this key statement from my weekend notes that sums up my \"No Cannibalization, Just Multiplicative Bootstrapping Integration\" (that I introduced last week during Computex)...\n\n\"ALL OLD and NEW DGX-GPU systems BENEFIT FROM CUDA SOFTWARE UPGRADES, SUCH THAT ALL PREVIOUS GENERATION CHIP-SETS ACTUALLY GET FASTER!\"\n\nThis is way beyond the \"backward compatibility\" thesis, so it gets lost on most analysts.\n\nThis is built-in \"acceleration multiplicity.\"\n\nTo say that the NVIDIA stack of enlightened software that extracts the most from the accelerated hardware is \"an exponential event-horizon for enterprise and science\" is the understatement of the decade.\n\nWe may not like what Meta, Google, and Amazon do with this massive data-power over society, but the genie is long out of the bottle.\n\nNow, we're aboard the ETI (Exponential Technology Innovation) Rocket that I previewed in 2017 in my Technology Super Cycle thesis.\n\nAnd as NVIDIA CUDA-DGX-GPU acceleration has surprised almost everyone to rival Apple and Microsoft valuations, it's also deliciously ironic that the \"Agree to Disagree\" topic for this month's ZUSS was...\n\n\"Ben Rains and Kevin Cook will Agree To Disagree on whether the U.S. National Debt matters to the U.S. economy and the market.\"\n\nWhen I last addressed this debate with some degree of interest, it was 3 years ago here...\n\nWhy the National Debt is Irrelevant\n\nIn any case, let's buy all the NVDA shares we can below $120 because my new price target for 2026 is...\n\n$200!\n\nNo one had a $2,000 price target pre-split so just ignore the Wall Street noise and stick with Cooker on the ETI that has yet to be seen!\n\nCooker\n\nWhat About Gloomy Goldman on the AI Bubble?\n\nYou've probably heard the hub-bub by now that Goldman research says the \"ROI on AI\" is non-existent. And that means of course that AI is a massive bubble ready to pop.\n\nThat's some cute \"could happen\" analysis. But it ignores what the Fortune 1000, the Global 2000, and the 20 largest nation-states are really up to: investing deeply for the future they see 5 years from now where if you don't have your own deep learning, automation and LLM expertise, you will be mere gold dust against your competitors.\n\nAnd as I've been predicting since February, the sales estimates for NVIDIA were going to cross $150 billion and head to $200 billion very soon.\n\nWell it finally happened this month with an unnamed analyst posting a high-Street peg of $180 billion for next year.\n\nI think it might be Tim Arcuri from UBS because on July 8 he talked about his bull case seeing $204 billion for next year. Here's what I posted on Twitter/X that day...\n\nUBS analyst Tim Arcuri leads the bulls with the call today for $204 billion next year, despite Goldman handwringing about \"no ROI from all those GPUs yet.\" Still building the field of dreams AI factories for science and innovation!\n\nBottom line: As I've been saying for 2 years, the analysts are still way behind the curve of what is emerging for NVDA sales over the next 3-5 years. Join me in buying every dip below $120 and if $100 scares you, buy more.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nCrowdStrike is a premier cybersecurity firm focused on end-point threat detection and response.\r\n\r\nAnd before they became headline news this weekend, the Zacks Rank detected significant downward EPS estimates on June 8. On June 11, our Short List algorithm added CRWD shares and is currently posting a 30% gain (as of 7/22) after shorting at $380.\r\n\r\nWhy is CrowdStrike Such a Big Deal?\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike's co-founders George Kurtz and Dmitri Alperovitch were inspired by shortcomings in previous-generation security software technologies.

Interest rate cut prospects sparked off by falling inflation ignited a long-awaited rally among small-cap stocks that not only raised interest among individual investors but also billionaires like Stanley Druckenmiller.\n\nThis calls for investors to place their bets on growth-oriented small-cap stocks such as Amplify Energy Corp., Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corp. and LendingTree, Inc. for stellar returns.\n\nBig Tech Lose Their Appeal\n\nMarket participants have recently begun to move out of the favored tech behemoths, or the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, which have mostly fueled the market rally over the past year. The group, which consists of mega-caps such as NVIDIA, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon and Tesla has contributed to more than half of the broader S&P 500's return in the past year.\n\nHowever, these stocks have started to wobble as investors remain jittery about their stretched valuations and are drawing comparisons to the dot-com bubble. They believe that AI-driven revolutionary technology has primarily inflated the price of these mega-cap tech stocks, making them a risky bet for now.\n\nSmall Caps Are Now Wall Street Darlings\n\nIn a dramatic market shift, investors favored small-cap companies and other earlier detested sectors, including energy, real estate and finance. Small-cap stocks, in particular, have gained prominence as interest rate cut expectations increased.\n\nWith consumer price pressures ebbing amid a contraction in both manufacturing and service sector activity in June, the odds of a Fed rate cut as early as fall rise. The CME FedWatch Tool presently shows that 91.7% of market participants expect the Fed to trim interest rates by a quarter-point in the September policy meeting, up from a probability of 52% a month ago (read more: Rise in Rate-Cut Bets May Prompt Stock Gains for GOLD, KGC, FNV).\n\nInterest rate cuts, nonetheless, are a blessing in disguise for small caps. This is because any interest rate hike impacts small caps more than large caps due to a weaker balance sheet and higher debt levels. Notably, small caps have suffered for quite some time as the Fed kept its interest rates elevated to tame relentless inflationary pressure.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump's improving prospects in the presidential race bolstered a small-cap rally since some of his policies, such as increasing tariffs and reducing taxes, bode well for smaller companies. Likewise, the Russell 2000 Index, which predominantly comprises small-cap stocks, has gained more than 6% month to date. However, the small-cap index continues to remain below its 2021 peak, a tell-tale sign that it has more room to scale upward.\n\nDruckenmiller Making a Bet on Small Caps\n\nBillionaire investor Druckenmiller was successful in predicting the unprecedented NVIDIA stock rally. He bought several shares of NVIDIA at the end of 2022 and sold many of them at the beginning of 2024 not before he made mammoth gains.\n\nSimilarly, Druckenmiller has now raised his bets on small caps, with the May filings showing that his Duquesne Family Office has acquired stakes in the Russell ETF, an indication that not only retail investors but also billionaires are hopeful about a small-cap rally soon. IWM has gained a solid 8% so far this year.\n\n3 Small Cap Stocks Set to Rally Hard: AMPY, GLDD, TREE\n\nGiven the positives, it's judicious for astute investors to place bets on small-cap growth stocks like Amplify Energy, Great Lakes Dredge & Dock and LendingTree. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nAmplify Energy\n\nAmplify Energy is an oil and natural gas company. Amplify Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 17.4% over the last 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current and next quarters are 41.7% and 214.7%, respectively.\n\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock\n\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock is the largest provider of dredging services in the United States. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 24.1% over the last 90 days. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 414.3%.\n\nLendingTree\n\nLendingTree operates an online consumer platform in the United States. LendingTree has a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 0.8% over the last 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 18%.\n\nShares of Amplify Energy, Great Lakes Dredge & Dock, and LendingTree have gained 23.4%, 21.6%, and 73.2%, respectively, year to date.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

So Shawn Henry cut straight to the chase.\n\n\u201cOn Friday we failed you, and for that I\u2019m deeply sorry,\u201d began the post, written by CrowdStrike\u2019s chief security officer.\n\nAn update pushed out from the cloud just hours before the work week came to an end caused Windows-based computer systems to crash, boot up and crash again in an\u00a0endless loop punctuated only by the so-called BSOD, or \u201cBlue Screen of Death\u201d.\n\nKey industries around the world that used Crowdstrike\u2019s Falcon software\u2014like aviation, banking and healthcare\u2014were paralyzed for hours if not days. Delta airlines is still reeling, cancelling hundreds of flights on Monday and leaving passengers stranded for days on end.\n\nThis CrowdStrike outage is a thing of nightmares.

Even worse with FDE.\n\nI have flashbacks of Nimda and the reboot loop, but this is worse. pic.twitter.com/qY5apjMBaU\n\n\u2014 Tim Medin \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\udf3b (@TimMedin) July 19, 2024\n\n\u201cThe confidence we built in drips over the years was lost in buckets within hours,\u00a0and it was a gut punch,\u201d Henry continued. \u201cWe let down the very people we committed to protect, and to say we\u2019re devastated is a huge understatement.\n\nThe genuine contrition expressed differed notably from the message coming from CEO and founder George Kurtz, whose company's stock has already lost roughly a quarter of its value as investors await word of possible lawsuits.\n\nKurtz\u2019s initial statement on Friday appeared so sanitized that customers could have been forgiven for thinking the problem might have lay elsewhere. Since there was no direct acknowledgement of CrowdStrike\u2019s culpability, there was not so much as a curt word of apology.\n\nnot even an apology? Bold strategy.\n\n\u2014 Tom Warren (@tomwarren) July 19, 2024\n\nHis reaction came as somewhat of a surprise. In theory Kurtz should have some practice in crisis communications, since he served as the chief technology officer for McAfee at the time when it, too, knocked out millions of computers worldwide in 2010.\n\nNow, U.S. House leaders are calling Kurtz to testify before Congress to explain the software update fiasco.\n\nStory continues\n\nBusinesses most affected were those providing critical services\n\nFor some customers, the words of his CSO come too little too late.\n\n\u201cWe just deleted Crowdstrike from all our systems,\u201d Elon Musk posted on Friday, though he wasn't clear whether he was talking about one or all of his businesses.\n\nWe just deleted Crowdstrike from all our systems, so no rollouts at all\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 19, 2024\n\nIn terms of lost economic output, it\u2019s hard to precisely measure the havoc his software firm visited upon the world. Microsoft estimated just 8.5 million Windows devices, or less than 1% of all machines, were affected at the end of the day. The problem was the concentration of industries relying on CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon software.\n\n\u201cWhile the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services,\u201d Microsoft said on\u00a0Saturday.\n\nInvestors have since flocked to smaller rival SentinelOne, whose stock has gained more than 20% since Friday. The CrowdStrike debacle may have also factored into cybersecurity firm Wiz now\u00a0passing on a reported deal to be acquired by Google parent Alphabet, reportedly worth $23 billion.\n\nUpon seeing the pullback in Crowdstrike, analysts at Deutsche Bank sought to rush out a quick broker note identifying it as a short-term buying opportunity for such a high-quality stock.\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d it added, \u201cwe were ironically unable to publish our original research note due to the outage itself.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Market speculators should consider cybersecurity specialist SentinelOne (NYSE:S) in large part because rival CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) messed up badly. It may be a while before CRWD\u2019s stain is removed. In the meantime, S stock looks awfully intriguing.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the core fundamentals. As stated in its public profile, SentinelOne is a cybersecurity provider focusing on protecting an enterprise-level client\u2019s endpoints, cloud workloads and identification credentials. It uses artificial intelligence and other advanced protocols to detect and address digital threats. Take a look at CrowdStrike\u2019s profile: different words, same business.\n\nWhy is this important? CrowdStrike is reeling after its system outage forced massive disruptions across various industries. The company\u2019s CEO must now testify to address the impact to critical infrastructures like air transportation and healthcare.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not as if enterprises can just ignore endpoint security. With digital threats lurking everywhere and the average cost of data breaches rising, going without protection is ludicrous. In the head-to-head competition, CRWD is out and S stock is in.\n\nTechnicals Favor SentinelOne\n\nAs traders might imagine, the technical profile for S stock has turned bullish amid the CrowdStrike carnage. In the past five sessions from Monday\u2019s close, SentinelOne gained over 6%. In the same period, CRWD suffered a catastrophic loss of more than 30%.\n\nBeyond the historical price data is the recent chart action. According to Barchart, S stock on Monday pinged as a possible opportunity in its J-Hook screener. Essentially, the J-Hook is a phenomenon where a publicly traded asset engages in a see-saw action. At the end of this sinusoidal pattern, a decisive breakout may materialize. From TradingView.com\n\nSource: Chart by TradingView\n\nAs with any technical indicator, there are risks as no indicator is a perfect one. However, Barchart utilizes a nine-step criteria before identifying an asset as a J-Hook opportunity.\n\nBased on Monday\u2019s price action, the intraday high took S stock to $24.80. That\u2019s a possible clue that the bulls will be aiming for resistance at $25, which represents a prior level of support. Also, $25 is a psychologically significant milestone, being a quarter of the way to $100.\n\nTrade of the Day: Buy S Stock Long-Expiry Call Options\n\nGiven the fundamental tailwind and the technical J-Hook signal, there are many ways to play S stock. However, for the Trade of the Day, investors may consider long-expiry call options. Specifically, I\u2019m looking at the 2025 Jan. 17 $25 call.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs stated earlier, the price action on Monday suggests that $25 represents bullish traders\u2019 next logical target. Therefore, if one elects to go the options route, it\u2019s important to find a contract with enough time for the trade to realistically pan out. Also, by going out the money (OTM), traders may be able to boost their profitability potential.\n\nThe main risk factor to be aware of is that technical support exists at $22. Therefore, S stock could fall back to this point. At the same time, CrowdStrike may lose market share as organizations lose confidence in it. That could be the fundamental fuel for SentinelOne to rise back to its prior highs.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Loves AI Stocks. Here Are 5 She Bought in the First Half of 2024.",
        "content": "It's not only their politicking that draws interest these days. With politicians demonstrating a remarkable ability to outperform the market, investors are increasingly interested in the stock picks of senators and representatives. Take the Peach State representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, for instance, who has been an avid buyer of stocks so far in 2024.\n\nBut it's artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in particular that seem to be the focus of Greene's interest in the first half of 2024. In addition to AdvancedMicroDevices(NASDAQ: AMD), Greene also picked up shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM).\n\nGreene gained broad exposure to the AI industry\n\nStarting her 2024 stock purchases in April, Greene bought shares of both Qualcomm and Microsoft. Although the exact value of the transactions isn't known, Greene reported in regulatory filings that each transaction was valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Both buys provided Greene with notable -- yet diverse -- exposure to the rapidly burgeoning AI industry.\n\nA leading semiconductor manufacturer, Qualcomm is targeting generative AI applications for mobile devices with its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Mobile platform. In addition, its providing AI functionality to personal computers with its Snapdragon X Elite Platform and automobiles with Snapdragon Digital Chassis. Focused on software, Microsoft's commitment to offering sophisticated AI solutions is demonstrated with Copilot -- an AI tool that is available across Microsoft's suite of products from Word and Excel to Designer, where users can create unique images with DALL-E 3.\n\nThe following month, Greene broadened her AI exposure with positions in Apple and Advanced Micro Devices in two transactions that were each valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Making a concerted effort to offer more AI capability, Apple has been working on its own large language model (LLM), dubbed Ajax. In early June, moreover, Apple revealed Apple Intelligence. Available on its various devices, Apple states that Apple Intelligence \"combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that's incredibly useful and relevant.\"\n\nLike Qualcomm, AMD also produces the hardware that's powering AI. In addition to its MI300 accelerators (specialized microprocessors) that are designed for generative AI and large language models, AMD manufactures Ryzen PRO 8000 processors, which the company characterizes as \"the first processors with dedicated, on-chip AI accelerators for commercial desktop [personal computers].\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn late June, Greene clicked the \"buy\" button on cybersecurity specialist CrowdStrike. Powered with AI, CrowdStrike helps clients protect a variety of devices including laptops, mobile devices, and those connected on the Internet of Things. In addition, CrowdStrike has developed a generative AI security tool, Charlotte AI, that integrates with various aspects of the company's Falcon platform.\n\nYou may be green with envy over Greene's picks, but that doesn't mean you should buy these AI stocks too\n\nWhile following politicians' stock picks is a smart strategy, blindly mimicking their buys is foolhardy at best. It's important for individual investors to do their due diligence and evaluate whether the stocks in question are smart choices for them. That being said, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Apple, and AMD are all industry leaders that are trading at premiums to their historical valuations.\n\nTherefore, value investors may want to keep these names on their watch lists instead of rushing to add them to their portfolios. Of course valuation isn't the only factor that investors should consider, so long-term investors may not want to investigate these tickers further before deciding to watch them from the side of the road.\n\nCrowdStrike, however, is in a different boat since it caused a global outage last week. With the sell-off that followed news of the global outage, CrowdStrike's stock is a lot less expensive today, giving back most of its 2024 gains. Inauspicious as the news may be for CrowdStrike, it's critical for investors to remember that this event, in and of itself, doesn't spell doom for the company.\n\nComputer code is complicated, and the flaw that was in the company's update is unfortunate but not an indication that there's something fundamentally wrong with the company. For those with the resolve to weather some near-term volatility, CrowdStrike may be a great addition for investors looking for a leading cybersecurity stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "CrowdStrike disruption far from over",
        "content": "Continued fallout is likely following recent mass technology disruption. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nThe CrowdStrike outage may not be the top headline today, but that does not mean the impact is a thing of the past. Delta is still digging out of the backlog, and computer systems are still coming back online for other companies.\n\nThe state of freight is still exposed to the CrowdStrike fallout. According to Niall van de Wouw, Xeneta\u2019s chief airfreight officer, \u201cThese incidents can take three times as long to resolve as the length of time they last, but that is very much dependent on the scale of the IT failure and the market conditions at the time it occurs.\u201d\n\nKatie Arrington, vice president for government affairs at Exiger, a supply chain intelligence company used by the U.S. government and critical infrastructure industries for risk management, warned that computer interconnectivity creates a lot of risk, leaving industries vulnerable to such flaws.\n\n\u201cWe have to increase the standards and requirements for managing these third-party computer updates,\u201d said Arrington.\n\nMicrosoft wrote in its blog that the CrowdStrike update impacted 8.5 million Windows devices \u2013 less than 1% of all Windows machines. It\u2019s remarkable to think all of this disruption was from just 1% of Windows devices.\n\nIn an analyst note downgrading CrowdStrike, Guggenheim analysts covering the company wrote: \u201cThough this is an insignificant percentage, the economic and logistical fallout to corporations and individuals, respectively, was immense. It also reflects the popularity of CrowdStrike as a technology vendor. In addition, given that endpoint security is often granted unique access to the source code of Windows in order to protect it, the quality assurance of these updates is paramount. In other words, CrowdStrike had the \u2018keys to the kingdom\u2019 and the responsibility that goes along with that.\u201d\n\nThe friendly skies are a part of the logistical kingdom, and there will be turbulence for supply chain managers to navigate in the days to come. Capacity in the marketplace was already limited.\n\n\u201cShippers already had concerns about air freight capacity due to huge increases in demand in 2024, driven largely by the extraordinary growth in e-commerce goods being exported from China to Europe and the US,\u201d said van de Wouw.\n\nThis latest IT failure is yet another reminder of how fragile our supply chain system is. We got our first wake up call during COVID, a reminder with the Red Sea diversions and now CrowdStrike. The world of trade still needs to build in redundancies.\n\nChad Sweet, former chief of staff for the first Homeland Security secretary, Michael Chertoff, and co-founder and CEO of The Chertoff Group, tells American Shipper that because these outages are increasing in frequency and impacting critical infrastructure, Congress and the executive branch could start holding hearings and proposing legislation or regulation on an issue that is impacting so many U.S. citizens.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe US Government requires companies providing it enterprise software to self-attest it is meeting a government standard called the Secure Software Development Framework, or SSDF, that includes best practices on software updates that may have prevented the Crowdstrike crash that the world just witnessed,\u201d said Sweet. \u201cThoughtful business leaders who recognize the benefits of getting ahead of this coming potential regulation are already striving to have their procurement departments require software suppliers to meet this Secure Software Development Framework.\u201d\n\nSweet said all good corporate leaders should be calling their senior leadership teams in and asking, \u201cWhat is our plan to maintain at least minimal operations in a disruption?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you were not affected, don\u2019t just sit back and have a sigh of relief. Use it as a wake up call within your own organization to do a hot wash of your enterprise\u2019s backup and resiliency plans in the event of an outage \u2013 whether malicious or unintentional,\u201d said Sweet.\n\nThe post CrowdStrike disruption far from over appeared first on FreightWaves.",

        "content": "I think we are LONG overdue for a CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spike. And it may be coming sooner than investors think.\n\nI know: Some people think I\u2019m always bearish, but that really isn\u2019t the case. At the core, I\u2019m quant-oriented. I look at various intermarket relationships that historically have some degree of predictive power and couch the movement in terms of what\u2019s going on from a macroeconomic perspective. To me, everything is about conditions that favor an accident. And in the context of markets, an accident is a sudden volatility move that catches investors by surprise.\n\nWe haven\u2019t had one of those in some time, at least not to where the VIX sustains a spike above the 20 level. I think that could be about to change. And for a few reasons.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFirst off, as I\u2019ve noted before, from a seasonality perspective, we are in the window where historically volatility for stocks tends to rise in an election year. This goes beyond the headlines with current candidates and news that President Joe Biden won\u2019t run for reelection. This goes beyond the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. This just goes to historical patterns. Current dynamics obviously further add fuel to history\u2019s fire.\n\nPlus, gold continues to suggest that big money is positioning into non-correlated assets. This suggests institutional investors are worried that stock market risks are rising. Utility stocks are perking up again, another sign that investors are trying to counter risk. And Treasurys are stabilizing as investors start to price in a rate-cutting cycle by the Federal Reserve.\n\nI\u2019ve been in the business for 20 years and I have NEVER seen complacency among individual investors and financial advisors as I do now. Investors currently have way too much exposure to a select number of large-cap tech stocks. They are betting that Trump will win in November, lower taxes, and issue in a goldilocks economy. This all sounds great. However, beneath the surface something is clearly bothering the stock market and in a bad way.\n\nPerhaps CrowdStrike\u2019s (NASDAQ:CRWD) global IT outage is just a reminder to the world that risk happens fast, can come out of nowhere, and can shock markets while we sleep. In the same vein, I believe a VIX spike is coming. And when it does, it could be a big one that shocks the complacency out of everyone.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Gayed did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Airline Stocks to Buy on the Dip: July 2024",
        "content": "There are multiple reasons why the overall airline market has been bearish lately. This includes the large influx of negative incidents related to Boeing (NYSE:BA). As most readers are undoubtedly aware, alleged issues with quality control on BA\u2019s part led to multiple, less-than-ideal incidents occurring. Recently, the entire sector had a meltdown, primarily due to the global technology outage caused by Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) releasing an update that had critical errors in it.\n\nAs a result, multiple airline stocks are trading at weekly, monthly or yearly lows. This is despite the sector\u2019s revenue per passenger kilometers growing at 11.6% year-over-year (YOY), and a 9.7% increase in revenue this year, as per the International Air Transport Association. Thus, we are ripe for a market correction that will help retail investors. Here are a few airline stocks that are likely to recover from recent lows and generate handsome returns.\n\nDelta Air Lines (DAL) Delta (DAL) airlines plane mid take-off\n\nSource: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.com\n\nDelta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is a company focused on both the consumer and commercial aspects of aviation. While the vast majority of its hubs lie in North America, DAL has a significant global presence. The company\u2019s stock price is down almost 8% over the last month, indicating that now is the time to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company has been consistent with meeting revenue expectations. In all four of the last four quarters, DAL has met expectations, even exceeding them in three. Analysts have given the company an average price target of $60.63, indicating potential growth of over 33% before the end of this year. Additionally, the company\u2019s financials are great as a return on equity of 43.81% indicates efficient allocation of resources. It is something that gets passed on to shareholders.\n\nHowever, it might be wise to wait a little before investing. The technological outage towards the end of last week has created quite a lot of negative publicity, which could cause the company to slip even further. Regardless, nothing immediately suggests that DAL is a bad investment for the long term. Whenever you get in, if you hold, it is sure to give you decent returns.\n\nAmerican Airlines Group (AAL) American Airlines plane on ramp in Chicago Airport. American Airlines is amongst the airlines cancelling flights\n\nSource: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) is another company that specializes in both consumer and cargo-centric aviation. It operates primarily in the U.S.. However, through partnerships with gateways abroad, it has established a presence in London, Tokyo and other major cities. The stock is currently trading at $10.58 and is down over 68% in the last five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite this, AAL still holds a price target of $13.35, which is set by taking the average price targets from 15 analysts. This yields an expected return of over 26% by the end of this year, far surpassing the expectations set for the broader market. However, the company faces significant challenges. Its profit margins are extremely thin. Although it has seen year-on-year quarterly revenue growth of 3.1%, AAL hasn\u2019t seen a sizeable increase in profit.\n\nAcquisition of talent is going to be a driving factor of growth when it comes to AAL. It needs experienced professionals who can apply their skills to its business. With that being said, Tulsa Tech\u2019s aviation school has partnered with AAL. Should management take more steps to address expenditure inefficiency, I see this stock outperforming many in the sector.\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL) The side of a United Airlines (UAL) plane with \"united\" written above passenger windows. Represents airline stocks.\n\nSource: travelview / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnited Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is yet another commercial aviation giant. While it is based out of the U.S., it has operations all around the world and is a member of the influential Star Alliance. United recently beat Q2 earnings, however, the stock is still down almost 49% over the past five years.\n\nWhile market indicators are bearish in the short term, analysts are predicting annual growth rates of 26.66% annually for the next five years. This is almost certain to increase the value of your investment. The company also seems to be severely undervalued, with analysts predicting a 50+% jump before the end of the year.

        "title": "Column: The CrowdStrike meltdown reminds us that the hacking problem doesn't come only from outside",
        "content": "Just last Wednesday, I posted a column reporting how our richest corporations, through sheer miserliness and profit-seeking, left millions of Americans vulnerable to technological attacks on their privacy and welfare.\n\nI failed to raise one important question: What if the attacks come from inside the house?\n\nThat's exactly what happened Friday. An ineptly designed update to a program rolled out by the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike and installed automatically on users' machines instantly crashed millions of computers running Microsoft programs and left them disabled until manual fixes could be undertaken. Some haven't been fixed yet.\n\nCrowdstrike seemingly borrowed Boeing\u2019s approach to quality control.\n\nBusiness blogger Ed Zitron\n\nThe fallout reached worldwide and affected people across the modern technological landscape. Thousands of flights were canceled. Doctors couldn't perform surgeries. Banking transactions were frozen. Emergency 911 lines went silent.\n\nThe affected computers displayed what Microsoft Windows users know as the dreaded \"blue screen of death.\" Typically, this is a baby-blue screen bearing the message that Microsoft's operating system hadn't loaded correctly and the machine should be restarted.\n\nThat didn't work this time: The errant CrowdStrike application was burrowed so deep within the Microsoft operating system \u2014 as it's designed to be \u2014 that every time a machine restarted, it ran into the same glitch and went dead again in an infinite doom loop.\n\nThe CrowdStrike program \u2014 irony of ironies \u2014 is an anti-hacking application that identifies hacking attempts and fights them off. In the cat-and-mouse game pitting computer users against hackers, such applications have to be updated regularly. They reside in the bowels of the operating system, because in order to be effective, they have to load before almost any other function.\n\nIn this case, a coding error in the update delivered an order to the operating system that caused the system to shut down.\n\nThat's a simplified explanation of what happened. Now let's look at the lessons this episode teaches us \u2014 if we're willing to learn them.\n\nThey have to do with our complacency about our dependence on digital systems, including those distributed by developers we've never heard of (CrowdStrike, for instance).\n\nWhat few people are aware of as they go about their lives is how much crucial digital infrastructure is based on Microsoft programs and applications, and how much of those are supplemented by third-party programs and applications.\n\nAll of this must work together to work smoothly \u2014 or to appear to work smoothly. Here and there something goes wrong, but its ramifications are sufficiently constrained that it can be rectified quickly, and even invisibly.\n\nRead more:Column: After a years-long pause, the FCC resurrects 'network neutrality,' a boon for consumers\n\nA great deal of it, furthermore, is automated; it's designed to run with a minimum of human intervention. In the view of the IT departments that are expected to monitor all this, humans are perpetual money pits \u2014 they need days off, get sick, demand raises, quit and must be replaced by newbies needing training, etc., etc. By comparison, machines look like a one-time capital expense \u2014 set it and forget it, is the goal.\n\nMicrosoft is the hub of these networks because Microsoft made them its business. It created an open architecture for third-party developers to piggyback on; the fundamental idea was that by extending the system's capabilities, those other developers made Microsoft's central system more valuable. Microsoft either outsourced some functions to independent developers, or allowed them to design applications that competed with Microsoft's versions \u2014 but those still were designed to work with Microsoft operability.\n\nAmong those developers is Austin, Texas-based CrowdStrike, one of countless firms offering cybersecurity services to Windows users. (Microsoft's own cybersecurity suite is known as Defender.)\n\nApple computers and devices don't have the same vulnerabilities because that company does almost all its extensions in-house, and keeps a very close eye on what it allows to interact with its software and hardware; the company doesn't allow outside applications to interact with its operating system at the fundamental level available with Microsoft's systems.\n\nBut Apple doesn't have anywhere near as large a footprint in enterprise services as Microsoft. A report issued in March by the government's Cyber Safety Review Board about a major hacking intrusion into Microsoft's cloud system in March 2023 asserted that the company's \"ubiquitous and critical products ... underpin essential services that support national security, the foundations of our economy, and public health and safety.\"\n\nAnyone living in the modern world has to confront the drawbacks of our reliance on digital technology on almost a daily basis. In prehistoric days, back when our household appliances were mechanical or electric, not electronic, a breakdown was easy to diagnose and fix \u2014 switch out a tube or tighten a screw.\n\nWhen a device ceases to function today, it's often impossible to pinpoint the fault \u2014 did my TV go bad, or did the internet go down, or was it just the channel I was watching?\n\nRead more:Column: 60 years ago in Los Angeles, piano virtuoso Glenn Gould revolutionized the music industry by ending his concert career\n\nYet many of us rely on a single company for multiple services. For example, I get my home phone service, broadband internet, and television/video (broadcast and cable channels and streaming) from a single provider. I don't have much choice, since for most of these it's the only provider in my neighborhood. But when it goes down, everything goes down.\n\nThat provider, Spectrum, has tried to sell me on its mobile phone service too. I've refused, because I figure I need at least one thread of access to the outside world that isn't dependent on its all-in-one monopoly.\n\nMicrosoft's near-dominance of cloud computing \u2014 the ecosystem through which all those enterprise computers that went dead last week communicate with each other and with the outside world \u2014 should make all of us queasy, because the company's cybersafety record is atrocious.\n\nThe Cyber Safety Review Board investigation concluded that the March 2023 hack occurred because \"Microsoft\u2019s security culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul, particularly in light of the company\u2019s centrality in the technology ecosystem and the level of trust customers place in the company to protect their data and operations.\"\n\nThe board mentioned, among other things, a \"cascade of ... avoidable errors\" in the company's cybersecurity program, its failure to detect the compromise by hackers of its own \"cryptographic crown jewels\"\u2014it acted only the U.S. State Department discovered the incursion and alerted Microsoft.\n\nThe board found that Microsoft's security practices were inferior to those of \"other cloud service providers.\" The report mentioned Amazon, Google and Oracle as Microsoft rivals in cloud services with better security systems.\n\nMicrosoft pledged to \"adopt a new culture of engineering security in our own networks\" and said it had \"mobilized our engineering teams to identify and mitigate legacy infrastructure, improve processes, and enforce security benchmarks.\"\n\nThe CrowdStrike crash suggests that those efforts are still works in progress. It's fair to say that much of the blame for the outage belongs to CrowdStrike, which allowed an update to a crucial application to be sent to users for automatic installation without doing the testing necessary to ensure that the update was operationally bulletproof.\n\nTechnology blogger Ed Zitron properly tied the disaster to the financialization of Big Business generally, in which pumping ever higher profits to shareholders becomes a higher priority than ensuring that one's products meet quality standards.\n\n\"Crowdstrike seemingly borrowed Boeing\u2019s approach to quality control,\" Zitron wrote, \"except instead of building planes where the doors fly off at the most inopportune times (specifically, when you\u2019re cruising at 35,000ft), it released a piece of software that blew up the transportation and banking sectors, to name just a few.\"\n\nRead more:Column: Excited about AI and self-driving cars? A top roboticist is here to burst your bubble\n\nCrowdStrike Chief Executive George Kurtz moved promptly to \"sincerely apologize\" to all affected users, via a statement and an appearance on the NBC \"Today\" show. \"We quickly identified the issue and deployed a fix, allowing us to focus diligently on restoring customer systems as our highest priority,\" Kurtz said in a posting on the company's website.\n\nMicrosoft placed the blame chiefly on CrowdStrike. \"Although this was not a Microsoft incident, given it impacts our ecosystem, we want to provide an update on the steps we\u2019ve taken with CrowdStrike and others to remediate and support our customers,\" David Weston, a vice president for enterprise and security, wrote on the company's website.\n\nBut Microsoft, plainly, failed to take on board the necessity of vetting every piece of third-party software that could have an effect on its own customers \u2014 before it blew up their computer systems.\n\nNo software system is immune from errors, especially now that they're so complex and multilayered that not even their developers may know all their weak spots. (An error at Amazon's cloud service incapacitated as many as 150,000 websites for several hours in February 2017 \u2014 a major problem, but not nearly on the scale of the CrowdStrike crash.)\n\nBut as these systems play an ever-expanding role in modern life even as they become more complex, it's incumbent on their providers to make security and safety their top priorities, not merely mouth the concept in marketing material without actually taking it seriously.\n\nCloud clients also need to pay more attention to what is getting automatically inserted into their systems. Who has the right to gloat over escaping the CrowdStrike meltdown last week? Amusingly, it's Southwest Airlines. For decades, Southwest resisted Microsoft's urgings that it upgrade its systems to the latest versions of Windows, relying on Windows 3.1, which is 32 years old \u2014 so antique that the CrowdStrike update wouldn't even work on the airline's systems.\n\nSo while affected carriers such as Delta, United and American had canceled nearly 2,400 flights by 6 p.m. Friday, Southwest had canceled three. (By midday Monday, the number of canceled flights reached beyond 12,300.) That doesn't mean that Southwest gets everything right. After all, the airline suffered more than its competitors from the ferocious storm in December 2022 that snarled air traffic nationwide \u2014 precisely because it had not paid enough attention to keeping its computer systems updated.\n\nIn this case, however, Southwest's cheapskate culture was its savior. That may only put it on the same level as the proverbial blind squirrel that occasionally finds a nut. But it shows that all of our Big Business squirrels need to keep their eyes open, and focused on the perils of inattention.\n\nGet the latest from Michael Hiltzik\r\nCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.\r\nSign me up.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "CrowdStrike Shares Plunge on a Major Outage. Is This a Golden Opportunity to Buy the Stock?",
        "content": "Shares of CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) sank after the cybersecurity company experienced a major outage that caused disruptions to businesses around the globe. Nonetheless, the stock is still up more than 70% over the past year.\n\nLet's take a look at the recent outage, the impact it could have on the company moving forward, and whether the dip is a buying opportunity.\n\nOutage impacts customers around the world\n\nThe CrowdStrike-related outage stemmed from a bug in a software update the company pushed out. The crash impacted millions of Microsoft Windows devices worldwide, causing Windows-based computers and tablets to crash. The outage impacted numerous industries from governments, to banks, to airlines, which had to cancel flights. Apple and Linux-run devices were not impacted.\n\nThe company undid the software update and gave clients a manual workaround to fix affected devices. As such, the company said it may take some time for some systems to be restored.\n\nMicrosoft said that about 8.5 million devices were impacted by the outage. While that makes up only about 1% of Windows-based devices, the outage caused widespread disruptions across the globe.\n\nAt the very least, this is a bit of a black eye for the company and showed how one mistake can disrupt so much. And while the company likely won't be financially liable for the outage, it could give some important customers who were overly impacted some price concessions.\n\nSome analysts, such as Wedbush's Dan Ives, argued the biggest risk to CrowdStrike is that this incident could tarnish its brand and that it opens the door for other cybersecurity companies to take away its business. However, cybersecurity outages are not unique to CrowdStrike and minor ones can be quite common occurrences.\n\nCrowdStrike is still largely considered to be the gold standard for endpoint security, and this outage likely doesn't change that perception. The disruption caused by the outage also shows just how much CrowdStrike has become ingrained in the IT fabric of industries around the globe and how important the company is.\n\nCybersecurity companies have recently been pushing customers to consolidate on one platform, arguing that they get better protection from a unified system that works together compared to stringing disparate endpoint solutions together. It will be interesting to see if customers continue down this path or want to keep multiple vendors.\n\nThat said, I don't think that this outage by itself will have any long-term implications for CrowdStrike or its stock, as organizations will ultimately continue to gravitate toward best-of-breed cybersecurity solutions.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs it time to buy the dip?\n\nWhile I don't think the outage will have any lasting impact on CrowdStrike's long-term prospects, whether now is a good time to buy the dip in stock price is a whole different question. The one knock on CrowdStrike has been its hefty valuation, and the recent dip in the stock price did not suddenly put it into bargain-bin territory.\n\nThe stock now trades at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio based on fiscal 2026 (ending January) estimates of about 14.7 times. That is still the highest valuation among its cybersecurity peers. The company is growing strongly, putting up 33% revenue growth in the first quarter, but other peers have also shown strong revenue growth as well. For example, SentinelOne grew its revenue 40% in Q1, while Zscaler saw its revenue rise 32% for its most recent quarter. CRWD PS Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nGiven its premium valuation, I wouldn't jump into CrowdStrike's stock just yet. However, if the outage causes the stock to continue to trend lower, closer to the valuations of other cybersecurity stocks, I would become more interested in owning the stock.\n\nI continue to view CrowdStrike as best of breed in the cybersecurity space, but valuation does still matter.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "CrowdStrike\u2019s CEO confronts his own crisis",
        "content": "Good morning.\n\nIs it too late now to say sorry? By the time CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz posted a message on X about the software \u201cdefect\u201d that unleashed global chaos on Friday, his problem was technically solved. The issue had been \u201cidentified, isolated and a fix has been deployed,\u201d he wrote. While the bug hit less than 1% of Windows devices, it grounded more than 6% of the world\u2019s commercial flights. It also halted surgeries, broadcasts, money transfers, 911 call centers, train systems, stores, hotel reservations, mobile apps, and some government services. As of yesterday, many were still scrambling to recover.\n\nNow, Kurtz and CrowdStrike enter a risky period. A cybersecurity company\u2019s software update just wreaked more havoc than any virus it was designed to block. Losses could rise into the billions and customers will at least pause to examine the perils of being too tied to one technology. Hackers are creating new security threats, the stock is down by almost a third, and Kurtz is being called to testify before Congress.\n\nThe fact that this catastrophe was caused by CrowdStrike\u2019s failure made it all the more notable that Kurtz didn\u2019t apologize from the outset. A few hours later, he did go on the Today show to say \u201cwe\u2019re deeply sorry,\u201d later giving a personal apology to those impacted on another show. (That appears to be the extent of his media tour, by the way.) As reputation guru Davia Temin told me on Saturday, \u201cWhat you say first counts double as that\u2019s the sentiment people remember.\u201d\n\nSome CEO statements are so mind-boggling that they\u2019re hard to shake, from the then BP chief Tony Hayward saying \u201cI\u2019d like my life back\u201d after the deadly Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 to Boeing CEO David Calhoun telling a Senate subcommittee \u201cI\u2019m proud of our safety record\u201d just last month.\n\nPrior to Friday\u2019s outage, CrowdStrike was one of the best-performing stocks this year. It\u2019s likely built a reservoir of goodwill with customers, who could forgive\u2014though Elon Musk did not, announcing on X that he\u2019d removed CrowdStrike from all systems. At the same time, having experienced a major IT crash while serving as CTO of McAfee in 2010, Kurtz should have been better prepared to handle this kind of crisis.\n\nAnd yet CrowdStrike\u2019s response remains, at best, underwhelming. Three days after what may be the largest IT outage in history, CrowdStrike\u2019s home page looked cluelessly upbeat\u2014boasting the \u201cfastest mean time to detect.\u201d Does waiting 78 minutes to detect and roll back a carnage-causing update qualify as fast? There\u2019s no mention of that incident, other than a subtle link to a \u201cremediation and guidance hub\u201d with PR statements that look like a user manual.\n\nStory continues\n\nI know this because CrowdStrike responded to my request for comment from Kurtz by sending me links to those statements. To be fair, Kurtz must be getting a lot of requests\u2014from media, customers, vendors, lawyers and more. Maybe Kurtz felt a few TV hits were sufficient to get the word out. It was a summer Friday, after all.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDiane Brady\r\ndiane.brady@fortune.com\r\nFollow on LinkedIn\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Short sellers piling into bets against CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. were rewarded Friday when a botched software update from the firm sparked a global IT outage and sent shares plunging to their worst day since November 2022.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Exit Puts Trump Trade in Doubt as Election Gets Re-Set Joe Biden Bows to Democrats Who Wanted Him Out, Upending US Politics Biden Exits Race, Endorses Harris as She Shores Up Support Biden Is Out: What\u2019s Next for Democrats, Explained A Brief History of Kamala Harris and Her Politics\n\nThe contrarian group reaped paper profits of $461 million on the cybersecurity software company\u2019s 11% drop, according to data from S3 Partners LLC. The selloff was enough to swing CrowdStrike short sellers to gains year to date. Shares of the company fell as much as 13% Monday, adding even more to the cohorts\u2019 mark-to-market profits.\n\nTotal short interest in the systems software sector \u2014 or, the dollar amount of bets that the stocks will decline \u2014 has increased by nearly $12 billion so far this year, per S3 data. More than $7 billion of that figure is made up of increased short selling, while the remainder is due to the mark-to-market increase in the value of shares shorted. CrowdStrike has seen the second-largest uptick in short selling in the sector this year, trailing only giant Microsoft Corp.\n\n\u201cWe should see continued short selling in this sector, but as we saw over the last 30 days, short selling and short covering will be name specific,\u201d Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3, said in a Friday report.\n\nMultiple analysts covering the company downgraded ratings and cut price targets over the weekend, further weighing on shares Monday.\n\n\u201cWe find it difficult to tell investors that they need to buy CRWD right now,\u201d Guggenheim analysts led by John DiFucci wrote in a note dated July 21, downgrading shares to neutral from buy citing possible resistance to new deals in the near-term following the outage.\n\nWhile DiFucci removed his $424 price target on CrowdStrike shares, he said he believes \u201cthat the company will eventually become even stronger as a result of this incident, and if investors have a multi-year horizon, they can ride it out.\u201d\n\nAnalysts at Scotiabank cut shares to sector perform from outperform, calling the outage a \u201cblack mark on a previously unblemished record.\u201d They also cut their price target to $300 from $393.\n\nThe incident adds to uncertainty ahead of the company\u2019s second quarter earnings, expected at the end of August.\n\n\u201cCrowdStrike deserves a top-tier multiple, but we see the risk/reward as more balanced at these levels,\u201d Scotiabank analysts led by Patrick Colville wrote in a Monday note.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the global IT debacle, Wall Street remains largely bullish on the company, which has 41 buy ratings, eight holds and two sells. The average analyst price target of around $390 a share represents a more than 40% upside from where the stock currently trades. CrowdStrike shares are still up about 7% this year even after the selloff.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAirbnb Hosts Want Guests to Come to Them Directly The $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into The Zombie Mall King Doesn\u2019t Want to Be a Bottom-Feeder Forever Five Questions With Apollo Global Co-Founder Josh Harris Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

(AP) \u2014 Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike says a \u201csignificant number\u201d of the millions of computers that crashed on Friday, causing global disruptions, are back in operation as its customers and regulators await a more detailed explanation of what went wrong.\n\nA defective software update sent by CrowdStrike to its customers disrupted airlines, banks, hospitals and other critical services Friday, affecting about 8.5 million machines running Microsoft's Windows operating system. The painstaking work of fixing it has often required a company's IT crew to manually delete files on affected machines.\n\nCrowdStrike said late Sunday in a blog post that it was starting to implement a new technique to accelerate remediation of the problem.\n\nShares of the Texas-based cybersecurity company have dropped nearly 30% since the meltdown, knocking off billions of dollars in market value.\n\nThe scope of the disruptions has also caught the attention of government regulators, including antitrust enforcers, though it remains to be seen if they take action against the company.\n\n\u201cAll too often these days, a single glitch results in a system-wide outage, affecting industries from healthcare and airlines to banks and auto-dealers,\u201d said Lina Khan, chair of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, in a Sunday post on the social media platform X. \u201cMillions of people and businesses pay the price.

        "content": "Why CrowdStrike (CRWD) Stock Is Down Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) fell 13.7% in the afternoon session as\u00a0investors continued to assess the potential implications of the recent technology outage. On Friday, July 19, 2024, a security update pushed by CrowdStrike caused a global tech outage, with millions of Windows devices malfunctioning. Some displayed the dreaded \"blue screen of death\u2014an error screen that indicated a system crash.\"\n\nIn a press statement released after the incident, Microsoft estimated the total number of affected Windows systems to be 8.5 million devices. While it represented less than 1% of all Windows devices, the impact appeared severe, disrupting critical systems such as hospitals, banks, and airports.\n\nThe company has since deployed a fix. However, it appeared the damage had already been done, with the stock falling more than 20% since the incident. This suggests investors are uncertain about the knock-on effects of the incident. There could be concerns about the potential impact on the company's brand as markets access the losses caused by the incident. There is also uncertainty about the magnitude of expenses that will be incurred in the coming months due to the incident, which could include compensation to the affected parties.\n\nMultiple Wall Street analysts have since downgraded the stock's rating, citing some of these concerns. Guggenheim\u00a0analyst John DiFucci moved from a Buy to a Neutral rating, highlighting potential \"\u00a0resistance\u00a0to new deals in the near term.\" The analyst provided more reason for the downgrade, adding, \"The company's response to the issue it caused was impressive, but nevertheless, it caused significant disruption to businesses (and people) across the world. The restoration of its reputation may take more time and will likely affect new business signings, at least in the near term.\"\n\nSimilarly, a BTIG analyst downgraded the stock's rating from Buy to Neutral, expressing worries about the incident, and cited\u00a0\"more negative feedback than expected.\"\n\nOverall, these sentiments imply the market is still unsure about the overall impact of the incident. The stock's decline also suggests CrowdStrike has a huge task ahead as it works to regain the trust of all parties impacted by the incident.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nCrowdStrike's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 15 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for CrowdStrike and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago, when the company dropped 14.7% following a global technology outage. The outage was caused by a faulty update deployed by CrowdStrike to computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system. CrowdStrike has clarified that the issue wasn't caused by \"a security incident or cyberattack.\"\n\nCEO George Kurtz noted on the social media platform X (formerly called Twitter) that \"the issue has been identified, isolated, and a fix has been deployed.\" However, the issue had far-reaching consequences, affecting systems in industries delivering critical services, including hospitals, banks, and airports. CRWD stock's decline suggests markets might be struggling to understand the long-term implications of the issue, especially as it relates to CrowdStrike maintaining its dominance in the highly competitive cybersecurity space, which often permits little to no room for mistakes.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives provided insights on how this might play out, adding, \"It could create opportunity for some competitive displacements, but this will take time to determine the path of CIOs and companies looking ahead and related legal actions related to this outage.\"\n\nCrowdStrike is up 8.3% since the beginning of the year, but at $267.73 per share it is still trading 31.7% below its 52-week high of $392.15 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,050.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "content": "Shares of embattled cybersecurity company CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) crashed on Monday because Friday's incident is still in the spotlight. Various analysts downgraded their near-term expectations for the company from here, which might not be an overreaction. As of 10:15 a.m. ET, CrowdStrike stock was down 12% for the day and it's now down more than 30% from its all-time high hit earlier this month.\n\nThe analyst downgrades are here for CrowdStrike\n\nOn Friday, CrowdStrike updated its cloud-based software. But the update had a defect that caused an estimated 8.5 million Microsoft Windows devices to stop working, impacting financial institutions, airlines, and more. The stock obviously dropped on Friday as investors assessed the situation. But today Wall Street analysts are formally expressing their thoughts.\n\nWells Fargo analyst Andrew Nowinski lowered his price target for CrowdStrike stock today in expectation of higher legal fees in the near future, among other things, according to Investing.com. Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci lowered his price target because he expects potential customers to be reluctant to sign new deals for a while, until there's greater certainty that CrowdStrike won't make a mistake as big as the one it made last week.\n\nInvestors today are responding to the universally cautious tone from Wall Street.\n\nAre the analysts right?\n\nIn short, the analyst community is expressing very valid concerns for CrowdStrike stock right now. For cybersecurity stocks, one of the biggest risks has always been reputational risk from a single failure. Over the last few years, the company has seemed unstoppable as it won new customers and as existing customers continue to add on new software modules, boosting both revenue and free cash flow. But it was still susceptible to this risk.\n\nCrowdStrike isn't necessarily done -- I think that would be an extreme overreaction. It's important to note that the company's failure was a software defect, not a failure to defend against a cyberattack, which is key. But it still may take a while for the business to fully move past knocking down that many Windows systems last week. Therefore, Wall Street is being reasonable by lowering price targets today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "CrowdStrike Faces Downgrades Amid Concerns Over Pricing and Renewals Following Disruption\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock continued its downward price trajectory Monday as its cloud software update on Thursday triggered an outage that affected businesses worldwide.\n\nA failed update to CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform disrupted Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) systems, halting critical global services, including airports, ports, financial institutions, and hospitals.\n\nMicrosoft said the outage affected less than 1% of Windows users globally, equating to 8.5 million machines.\n\nAlso Read: Goldman Sachs Analyst Stays Course On CrowdStrike Despite Outage, Expects Strong Company Reputation To Aid Recovery\n\nWindows holds about 72% of the global operating system market share, while CrowdStrike commands nearly 24% in endpoint protection security.\n\nMicrosoft clarified that a prior agreement with the European Commission prevents it from adopting the same security measures as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as it battled criticism.\n\nSeveral analysts rerated Crowdstrike stock on Monday, voicing their mixed opinions on the prospects of the stock.\n\nGuggenheim analyst John Difucci downgraded CrowdStrike from Buy to Neutral. BTIG analyst Gray Powell downgraded from Buy to Neutral.\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Rob Owens maintained a Neutral and lowered the price target from\u00a0$400\u00a0to\u00a0$310.\n\nOwens notes the CrowdStrike incident as relatively unprecedented. With the incident impacting airlines, hospitals, and 911 call centers, the analyst expects that speculation around litigation will remain for some time, alongside uncertainty around pricing, renewals, and new logo additions. The analyst projects second-quarter revenue and adjusted EPS of $961.2 million and $0.99.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron reiterated an Outperform. Kidron removed CrowdStrike from his 2024 top picks. While the analyst remains positive about the long-term opportunity, he expects shares to face continued pressure near-term.\n\nCanaccord Genuity analyst Kingsley Crane reiterated a Buy and a $405\u00a0price target.\n\nRBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg maintained an Outperform rating and a price target of $420, down from $380.\u00a0\u00a0Hedberg expects CrowdStrike to emerge as a stronger cyber-security vendor as this was not a breach but rather a significant breakdown in process.\n\nThe analyst considers the outage a possible near-term overhang, which illustrates the interconnected nature of the ecosystem. Hedberg projects second-quarter revenue and adjusted EPS of $959.8 million and $0.99.\n\nTruist Securities analyst Joel P. Fishbein Jr reiterated a Buy with a price target of $400. Fishbein Jr. notes that the outage and impact are a result of a faulty software update rather than a security breach.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe analyst expects the outage to be okay with the fundamental demand for the company\u2019s security solutions. In the near term, it does dent the company\u2019s stellar image, but Fishbein Jr. did not expect its competitors to take market share from CrowdStrike. He remains a buyer on weakness.\n\nScotia Bank analyst Patrick Colville downgraded to Sector Perform from Sector Outperform with a price target of $300, down from the prior $393.\n\nColville voiced a similar opinion as per Trusit analyst Fishbein Jr. Colville projects second-quarter revenue and adjusted EPS of $953.8 million and $0.99.\n\nThe stock plunged 30% in the last five days.\n\nPrice Action: CRWD shares traded lower by 12.8% at $265.74 at the last check on Monday.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for CRWD\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Barclays Maintains Overweight Mar 2022 Canaccord Genuity Maintains Buy Mar 2022 Deutsche Bank Maintains Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for CRWD\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article CrowdStrike Faces Downgrades Amid Concerns Over Pricing and Renewals Following Disruption originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting: 3 Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "Cathie Wood may or may not be a fan of playground equipment, but there's no denying that she always has her eyes on slides. The Ark Invest founder, CEO, and stock picker has a habit of adding to her positions when they fall out of favor. She was in stride on the final trading day of last week.\n\nArk bought only three stocks on Friday, adding to her existing stakes in CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD), Oklo(NYSE: OKLO), and GitLab(NASDAQ: GTLB). CrowdStrike plummeted 11% after experiencing a debilitating outage. Oklo and GitLab inched marginally higher on Friday, but the stocks are down 18% and 15% respectively so far this year.\n\nWill these three stocks bounce back? Let's take a closer look at Wood's three latest buys.\n\n1. CrowdStrike Holdings\n\nCrowdStrike became a household name on Friday, unfortunately. The cybersecurity specialist prefers to work behind the scenes, helping its growing client base ward off online threats. It proved to be its own enemy late last week, as a platform update caused a widespread outage.\n\nThe IT breakdown grounded flights for several airlines. It also made Friday challenging for banks, hospitals, and other businesses caught in the crossfire of the faulty update. CrowdStrike shares tumbled for the day, but it's still a winning investment for most of its shareholders. The stock has doubled over the past year, more than tripling over the past five years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe real test for CrowdStrike comes now. Its reputation took a big hit on Friday, but that probably won't be enough for the marketplace to turn its back on its Falcon line of cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. It just has to make sure another IT outage doesn't happen anytime soon.\n\nCrowdStrike finally turned profitable on a reported basis last year. It's only building on its bottom line so far this year. It has consistently cranked out \"beat and raise\" performances. The next few quarters will be critical to make sure clients aren't leaving CrowdStrike behind.\n\n2. Oklo\n\nOklo is more than just a four-letter word to Wood. It's a fast fission tech and nuclear recycling company. Its goal is to help power plants provide affordable clean energy at scale, but right now its business is not scaling.\n\nOklo has traded publicly for three years, but it has yet to generate any revenue. Analysts don't see revenue until at least 2027. Losses are growing larger in the meantime. The stock rallied earlier this year, but it has shed more than half of its value since hitting an all-time high in May.\n\nLast week it announced that it completed the first successful end-to-end demonstration of its advanced fuel recycling process. Investors will still have to be patient, though. Wood has had a couple of years, but she's patient enough to buy potential long-term winners when they're marked down.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. GitLab\n\nBusiness has slowed at GitLab, but the deceleration is relative. After three fiscal years of delivering top-line growth of 66% or better, revenue rose just 37% last year. Most companies would love to be growing at that clip, but investors are holding out for more.\n\nGitLab started as an open-source platform to help programmers collaborate on code. It has evolved into a lucrative and flexible platform that helps an organization's tech team build, test, and deploy software.\n\nThe shares tumbled back in March, when the company warned that sales would decelerate even more this fiscal year. Analysts now see revenue growing at a 27% clip this year. The stock isn't cheap, but it has also landed well ahead of Wall Street's profit targets over the past four quarters.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Building a retirement portfolio is an important component for financial security. This portfolio can assist with living expenses and make it easier to maintain your current lifestyle. However, some investments are poised to generate higher returns than others.\n\nPutting your retirement funds into a high-yield savings account can leave you behind. Inflation has been growing at a high rate and leaves most savings accounts in the dust. Even though an interest-bearing bank account may give you a higher nominal net worth, your remaining cash will have less purchasing power than it did a few years ago.\n\nThe cybersecurity industry presents a long-term opportunity for investors who have plenty of time before they retire. Corporations are investing billions of dollars to fortify their digital defenses. Cybersecurity is projected to maintain a compounded annual growth rate of 9.7% from now until 2030. These are some of the top cybersecurity stocks that are ready to capitalize on the industry\u2019s high growth rate.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is arguably the best pure cybersecurity stock available right now, even as it endures a lot of heat from the recent global IT outage. It\u2019s important to note that Crowdstrike went haywire because of an update instead of a hacker getting into Crowdstrike\u2019s systems. The latter would be worse and indicate that the company\u2019s software doesn\u2019t offer sufficient protection from threats.\n\nWhile the update is more manageable and easier to correct in the future, that won\u2019t sit well right now. Shares have dropped by roughly 20% in one week after the global IT outage manifested itself.\n\nInvestors\u2019 reaction to the Crowdstrike news is reminiscent of when Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) got hacked. Many people instinctively rushed for the exits without thinking about the company\u2019s long-term fundamentals. Buying Okta after the initial reaction proved to be a great decision, and Crowdstrike is likely to reward shareholders in the same matter.\n\nUnlike Okta, Crowdstrike actually delivers profits and has impressive growth. Revenue increased by 33% year-over-year (YOY) in Q1 of fiscal year 2025. Profits surged to $42.8 million in Q1 FY2025 compared to $0.5 million profit from the same quarter last year.\n\nCommVault Systems (CVLT) An image of the word cybersecurity overlaid over a pixelated background, images of locks and shields and virus icons surrounding it. Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: BeeBright / Shutterstock\n\nCommVault Systems (NASDAQ:CVLT) has followed in Crowdstrike\u2019s footsteps by outperforming the stock market. Shares are up by 61% year-to-date (YTD) and have soared by 146% over the past five years. CommVault Systems is a cloud security firm that only has a 33 P/E ratio. It\u2019s also much smaller than Crowdstrike with its $5.4 billion market cap.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is benefitting from an annual recurring revenue model that is accelerating revenue growth. Higher growth numbers can support a lofty valuation and more gains for long-term investors. The stock currently offers growth at a reasonable price.\n\nCommVault Systems delivered 10% YOY revenue growth in Q4 FY2024 and comfortably exceeded the high end of guidance. That\u2019s an acceleration from 7% YOY full-year revenue growth. Subscription revenue was a major highlight, increasing by 23% YOY in the full-year. As subscription revenue continues to grow at a faster rate than overall revenue, the company should deliver higher gains for long-term investors.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also a big name in the recent global outage, but the dip presents a long-term buying opportunity. While the global outage was unpleasant and caused many delays, Microsoft has decades of experience. The company has navigated controversies and setbacks in the past, and it delivers robust growth in multiple verticals.\n\nThe tech giant has many business segments of advertising, gaming, business software, artificial intelligence (AI), social media and others. However, Microsoft\u2019s most important business vertical is its cloud platform.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud regularly delivers more than half of the company\u2019s total revenue. That trend continued in Q3 FY2024 as Microsoft Cloud revenue increased by 23% YOY. Many businesses store their data on the cloud to stay more organized. Also, Microsoft Cloud has built-in security features that keep hackers at bay.\n\nFurther, the tech conglomerate unveiled Copilot for Security earlier this year. This product makes it easier for small businesses and corporations to fortify their digital defenses. It uses AI to streamline various cybersecurity tasks. Microsoft\u2019s overall business model is also doing well based on 17% YOY revenue growth and 20% YOY net income growth.\n\nA global outage won\u2019t stop customers from storing data online, and many companies turn to Microsoft Cloud. Many investors have the outage on their minds, but it will be a distant memory in a few years as the company continues to gain market share.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CRWD, CVLT, and MSFT.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Delta Air Lines Inc. apologized Sunday for canceling thousands of flights during the busiest travel weekend of the summer as many of its systems failed following the catastrophic CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. IT outage on Friday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Exits Race, Endorses Harris as She Shores Up Support Biden\u2019s Exit Puts Trump Trade in Doubt as Election Gets Re-Set Biden Is Out: What\u2019s Next for Democrats, Explained Trump\u2019s Remarks Spark Rebuke From Mexico\u2019s President-Elect Joe Biden Bows to Democrats Who Wanted Him Out, Upending US Politics\n\nThe Atlanta-based carrier stood out as the airline worst affected by the technology meltdown, according to aviation data firm Cirium. US carriers \u2014 which form the world\u2019s biggest air-travel market \u2014 were by far the hardest hit among airlines globally.\n\nDelta Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian blamed the impact on a \u201csignificant number\u201d of functions that rely on Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Windows operating system, including its crew-tracking tools, rendering the airline unable to process large volumes of changes to flight personnel.\n\n\u201cI want to apologize to every one of you who have been impacted by these events,\u201d Bastian said in a statement, adding, \u201cwe understand how difficult it can be when your travels are disrupted.\u201d\n\nAll-in, the chaos led to more than 3,500 flights being canceled through Saturday, Bastian said, with more cancellations throughout Sunday. The disruption occurring during the profitable peak summer period hurt Delta, with flights exceeding 90% capacity, making it harder to rebook customers.\n\nCirium data showed the chaos continuing on Sunday, with Delta canceling 1,058 flights as of 6pm New York time, or 21.4% of its daily schedule. That accounted for the bulk of the almost 1,500 services among US carriers axed nationwide. Among Delta\u2019s peers, United Airlines Holdings Inc. also canceled several hundred flights.\n\nAmerican Airlines Group Inc., which was among the first companies last Friday to quickly get back to normal, canceled fewer than 100 on Sunday.\n\nSeparately, FlightAware data shows Delta has already canceled almost 240 flights on Monday, as of 11:30pm New York time Sunday.\n\nUS Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg criticized Delta\u2019s handling of the chaos, citing its \u201ccontinued disruptions and unacceptable customer service conditions\u201d.\n\n\u201cDelta must provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to take rebooking, free rebooking for those who do, and timely reimbursements for food and hotel stays to consumers affected by these delays and cancellations,\u201d tweeted Buttigieg on X.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince it erupted Friday, the global travel chaos has affected airlines and airports to varying degrees depending on the systems impacted and the vendors used.\n\nSome self-check in airport systems were rendered useless, passengers couldn\u2019t access ticket reservations, or airlines were not able to use cockpit communications systems. At some airports, airlines resorted to checking in passengers manually with hand-written boarding passes.\n\nA faulty software update by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike was responsible for 8.5 million computers worldwide seizing up, affecting everything from medical appointments to investment banks and train operators.\n\nAfter Microsoft, CrowdStrike is the second-biggest maker of \u201cmodern endpoint protection\u201d software and controls 18% of the $12.6 billion market, according to research firm IDC.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Zombie Mall King Doesn\u2019t Want to Be a Bottom-Feeder Forever Five Questions With Apollo Global Co-Founder Josh Harris Opioid Alternatives Face an Uphill Battle Against Insurers and Doctors How Trader Joe\u2019s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Why Are Hedge Funds Bullish on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks That Will Skyrocket.In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other stocks.\n\nThe primary lure of investing, as you're likely to know, is to make money. Every day thousands of investors pour into the market to pick out what they believe will be winners to make them rich. And, the market delivers as well. This has been quite clear in 2024, with the hype surrounding artificial intelligence having delivered previously unthinkable returns. Wall Street's favorite AI stock, the chipmaker that's responsible for providing the industry with GPUs to run AI workloads, has gained a whopping 636% since ChatGPT was released in November 2022. This stock ranks 4th in our list of \u00a0Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential, so if you haven't guessed by now, then do take a look.\n\nLooking at these spectacular returns, one would be hard pressed to conclude that if you want to make money on the stock market, then growth is the way to go. But as is the case with most things in life, details are lurking under the hood that go against this simple supposition. On this front, professors from the University of Illinois looked at the returns of large cap and small cap value and growth stocks starting from 1969 and ending in 2001. Taking a geometric mean of these returns, they revealed that large cap growth ('glamour') stocks delivered mean returns of 4.5%, 7.9%, and 3.8% between 1969-2001, 1979-2001, and 1990-2001, respectively. On the other hand, large cap value stocks delivered returns of 16.4%, 20.4%, and 18% over the three respective time periods. What's more, is that the returns offered by the value stocks during 1969 and 2001 also surpassed the returns of the S&P 500 index which sat at 11.4%!\n\nBut what about small caps? After all, small caps are all the hype on Wall Street these days as investors position themselves for an interest rate cut. July 11th saw the S&P's flagship index bleed 91 basis points, with the technology heavy NASDAQ shedding 1.98%. The NASDAQ's drop was led by its 100 most valuable non financial companies which shed 2.15% during the same day. On the other hand, the rising fortunes of small cap stocks accelerated on the 11th. The leading small cap stock index gained 2% during the day and nearly matched this during the first half an hour of trading on the 12th by gaining 1.6% as it opened significantly higher after the after and pre market trading sessions.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at these gains, you might be wondering which small cap stocks might be worth their while. Well, we looked at analyst sentiment as part of our coverage of 8 Best Small-Cap Stocks Ready to Explode According to Analysts and hedge fund sentiment as part of 15 Small-Cap Stocks with High Potential so you should check them out if you're interested in small cap stocks.\n\nComing back to the professors' research, during 1969-2001, 1979-2001, and 1990-2001, small cap growth stocks, were down by 2.8%, 1.8%, and 6.2%, respectively. On the other hand, small cap value stocks delivered geometric mean returns of 18.3%, 22.8%, and 17.7%, respectively. Seems like over the long term, investing in value stocks appears to be just as, if not more, worthwhile while large cap growth stocks appear to fare better than their small cap. peers.\n\nWhile you might be thinking that these stats do not apply to the current market, it's also true that they are relevant to an extent especially since 1990 to 2001 was characterized by soaring valuations fuelled by internet stocks. Right now, AI is all that anyone can talk about, even as investors are moving out of big ticket technology names into the under appreciated small caps. Back then, the shares of a California based internet connectivity equipment provider soared by a whopping 53,207% between January 1991 and April 2000. So, this would have seen $1,000 invested during the start soar to $533,000 at the peak, which, fair to say, is life changing money for most of us. Yet, those same shares are down by 36% since then and had tumbled by as much as 79% by February 2009. If you're interested in knowing what this stock is, it ranked 8th on our list of the 10 Best Communication and Media Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nAt the same time, not all growth stocks end up lower. Some of the biggest examples that weathered the storm after the dotcom bubble popped are the largest companies today. They belong to the eCommerce, consumer and enterprise software, and the broader technology industries. Today's mega cap stocks have gained anywhere between 6,455% to 203,377% and 437,010% since they were listed for trading. Safe to say, these 'fads' of the time weren't fads and the market knew what it was doing.\n\nTheir returns are also what drive growth investors in droves to the stock market. While eCommerce and consumer technology were trends of the past, there are dozens of trends that newsletter publishers have embraced with open arms these days as they promise the next stock capable of delivering 10x or even 100x in returns. Since you're likely to be aware of AI at this point, we'll skip it out and list some other ideas. One of the biggest, and perhaps underreported ideas that newsletters have been pitching is quantum computing. Quantum computing expands the amount of data that a traditional computer can compute, and while its stocks haven't delivered strong returns yet, publishers believe that the future is bright. You can look at some quantum computing stocks and a broader industry overview by reading 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In.\n\nOne trend that has delivered returns is weight loss. Since March 2023, these stocks have delivered as much as 173% in returns, and with newer products such as pills under development, some folks believe that there's more room left for growth. Another highly pitched trend is energy, specifically nuclear energy, uranium miners, and energy infrastructure stocks. All these will benefit from the growth in electricity consumption from AI data centers, according to newsletter publishers.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that might skyrocket, we scanned investment newsletters from Stock Gumshoe and narrowed down 20 stocks from newsletters dated back as far as June 13th. These were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024 and the top ten stocks were chosen. Stock Gumshoe's thesis and the date of each newsletter are also mentioned.\n\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:CRWD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q1 2024: 76\n\nDate of Newsletter: July 9th\n\nThe next stock comes from Louis Navellier who believes that not only is its underlying technology the next big world changer but also shares that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is involved in it. This technology is QaaS, or Quantum as a Service. This stock could be a \"6-figure\" payday, according to Navellier, and it was also \"the first company to hit $1 billion in revenue\" on Amazon's AWS marketplace. It is also \"one of the most profitable in the entire industry\" so looks like we've got another jackpot on our hands.\n\nThis stock is CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD). The firm's revenue is expected to grow between 25% to 30% over the next couple of years, and it's also got a high valuation which sits at 100x forward earnings. To boot, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for its revenue has been 70% since 2017, allowing it to grow its revenue from a mere $50 million to $3 billion.\n\nOverall CRWD ranks 4th on our list of the stocks that will skyrocket. You can visit 10 Stocks That Will Skyrocket to see the other stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Small businesses grapple with global tech outages created by CrowdStrike",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 An owner of a consumer insights research firm couldn't pay her employees, make Friday's deadline to sign a contract for a new business or send key research to a key client. A psychiatrist, who runs a virtual mental health practice in Maryland, saw his business hobbled as some of his virtual assistants and therapists couldn't either make phone calls or log on to their computers. And a restaurant owner in New York City was worried about how he was going to pay his vendors and his workers.\n\nBusinesses from airlines to hospitals have been grappling with a faulty software update that caused technological havoc worldwide on Friday, and its repercussions continued through the weekend. The breadth of the outages highlighted the fragility of a digitized world dependent on a few providers for key computing services.\n\nBut the problem appeared to divide those affected into haves and have-nots. Major customers of Microsoft and CrowdStrike are getting IT support to resolve the issues, but many smaller businesses whose Windows PCs may have received the problematic update are still struggling.\n\nTake Tsvetta Kaleynska, owner and founder of the Manhattan-based consumer insights company RILA Global Consulting, which has Fortune 500 clients. As of Saturday, she resolved the payroll issue and she got an extension until Monday on the research project. But the prospective client will not move forward with the new contract, cutting her annual earnings by nearly 25%, she estimated. The problem: she couldn't sign the contract because Docusign, which runs on Microsoft software affected by the faulty update, was down.\n\n\u201cIf I were part of a big company, then I would be able to delegate and get support from computer science or security services,\u201d Kaleynska said. \u201cBut as a small business owner, I am depending only on myself. It's pretty devastating.\"\n\nOn top of Kaleynska's business issues, she had to bring her ill daughter to a local hospital Friday because the hospital's phone lines were down.\n\nKaleynska, an immigrant from Bulgaria who became a U.S. citizen in 2023, said she's learned a hard lesson: \u201cOur lives are very fragile because they\u2019re based on technology, and we depend on technology.\u201d\n\nCrowdStrike is one of the largest cybersecurity firms in the U.S. and has a list of customers that includes more than half of the Fortune 500 companies as well as small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nFollowing the outage, the company provided an initial fix through a software update. But many computers are expected to need hands-on work that could take days, if not longer, to complete.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor many small businesses that are impacted, that could mean working around the clock this weekend to make sure their systems are up and running, said Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.\n\n\u201cSmall businesses rely on third parties for this not to happen and instead, it became a \u2018code red\u2019 situation,\u201d Ives said.\n\nOverall, Ives noted tech problems can be easier to fix for big companies that have a sizable number of experts on their payroll as opposed to small businesses who could face more of an \u201cuphill battle\u201d because they have fewer technical resources.\n\n\u201cThe ripple effects from this could be felt for days and weeks ahead,\u201d Ives said. \u201cIt's not just a black eye moment for CrowdStrike, but for the broader industry. You can\u2019t have one fat finger update take down a global ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAri Lightman, a professor of digital media at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Heinz College, agreed, noting the amount of money big companies spend on Microsoft and CrowdStrike is likely a large portion of their IT budget. On the other hand, small businesses can look at information online on how to resolve the outage. CrowdStrike has posted step-by-step manual fixes to its blog, but it can be intimidating for those who are less tech savvy.\n\nLightman said those corporations could sue for a loss of business, but small ones might use class action suits to go after CrowdStrike for compensatory damages.\n\nThe issue is affecting small businesses differently.\n\nHeather Garlich, a spokeswoman at Arlington, Va., grocery industry group FMI, said the outages were \u201csomewhat spotty and inconsistent depending on how businesses use certain Microsoft tools.\u201d She said she was aware of one with an issue with a human resource system, while another had problems with their routing system for distribution. Yet another had issues with its cash registers.\n\nChris Seabrook, who owns a locksmith services business in Melbourne, Australia, called Asguard Locksmiths, told The Associated Press in a Friday email that the IT outage had thrown a \u201csignificant wrench\u201d in his daily operations. He hasn\u2019t been able to send and receive emails, access critical files, manage his schedule or create invoices.\n\n\u201cMy Microsoft PC is essential for many important functions in my business,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs a one-man business, every minute counts and this disruption has forced me to adapt quickly to ensure my services remain as uninterrupted as possible.\u201d\n\nTo minimize the disruption, Seabrook borrowed a non-Microsoft device from a friend that enabled him to sign into his accounts and access some of his critical tools and information. He\u2019s also using his smartphone for important messages and organizing his schedule. And he's been contacting clients to update them on the situation. Seabrook didn't immediately respond to a follow-up email sent by The Associated Press on Saturday.\n\nSome small business owners have improvised to get work done.\n\nDr. Ozan Toy, a psychiatrist, and chief medical officer at the Maryland-based Telapsychiatry, which has 25 employees across the U.S., said some employees with Microsoft phone lines instead turned to the Ring Central System, while others shifted from Microsoft Teams to Zoom.\n\nToy said his business was fortunate to have several backups of its electronic medical record system, allowing them to resume communications with each other and their patients. As of Sunday, the practice's cloud based services were running, he said. Toy noted financial losses were \u201cminimal\u201d as it has an external answering service taking calls from patients.\n\nChris Delmond, the co-owner of Handcraft Hospitality, which operates three restaurants in Manhattan and one in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, said his restaurants remained open for business. But the outage meant he could not have access to his cloud-based accounting software app on the Microsoft platform. That prevented him from seeing receipts and invoices, and slowed his ability to process checks to his employees and suppliers. He had to resort to calling his banks to see whether deposits had been made and check balances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a small business owner. I have two other partners and we kind of do everything,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s up to us to find out what the issues are. I don\u2019t have large platforms that help me track.\u201d\n\nBut by late Friday afternoon, all the issues related to his business' cloud based systems were back to normal, Delmond said. He noted he didn't suffer any financial losses, but he added, \u201cIt's frustrating, but as a small business owner you deal with the ups and downs.\"",

        "title": "Is CrowdStrike's Big Blunder a Buying Opportunity?",
        "content": "CrowdStrike's (NASDAQ: CRWD) stock price plunged 11% on Friday, July 19, after an update to its cloud-based cybersecurity platform sparked a global IT outage across banks, airports, hospitals, retailers, other businesses, and government agencies. ATMs stopped working, flights were delayed, and crucial healthcare services went offline.\n\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said the incident was caused by a \"defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts\" and that a fix had already \"been deployed.\" Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), which was initially blamed for the outage because it only occurred on Windows systems, said it was working with CrowdStrike to resolve those issues.\n\nCrowdStrike certainly made a massive mistake and the market's reaction is understandable. But others are wondering if this news-driven pullback represents a good buying opportunity. Are they right? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy did CrowdStrike's outage cause so much damage?\n\nIn the past, most cybersecurity companies installed on-site appliances to run their services. But that hardware was expensive, sucked up power, took up a lot of space, and required constant maintenance.\n\nCrowdStrike addressed those issues with Falcon, a cloud-native endpoint security platform that didn't require any on-site appliances. As a cloud-based platform, Falcon was easier to install, scale, and update than appliance-based platforms. It also enabled CrowdStrike to lock clients into sticky recurring subscriptions and cross-sell more cloud-based modules to grow its revenue per customer.\n\nThose strengths have enabled CrowdStrike to grow like a weed since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019. From fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), its revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 65%, from $250 million to $3.06 billion.\n\nCrowdStrike now serves 298 of the Fortune 500 companies and 538 of the Fortune 1000 companies. However, that widespread adoption explains why CrowdStrike's flawed update caused so much damage in such a short time.\n\nHow fast was CrowdStrike growing?\n\nOver the past year, as macro headwinds forced many companies to rein in their spending, CrowdStrike's growth in both ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) and total revenue decelerated. But its net new ARR growth rose by double-digit percentages year over year again over the past three quarters -- which meant it was still gaining new customers in a challenging market.\n\nMetric Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Ending ARR growth (YOY) 42% 37% 35% 34% 33% Net new ARR growth (YOY) (8%) (10%) 13% 27% 22% Revenue growth (YOY) 42% 37% 35% 33% 33%\n\nData source: CrowdStrike. YOY = year over year. Note: Ending ARR is the sum of preexisting ARR with net new ARR.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike attributed that robust growth to its market-share gains, new government contracts, and the rollout of more generative artificial intelligence (AI) features for Falcon. By the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025, 44% of its customers had adopted at least six of its modules, up from 43% in the fourth quarter and 40% a year earlier.\n\nDuring the first-quarter conference call, Kurtz notably took a jab at Palo Alto Networks' (NASDAQ: PANW) new platformization strategy (which is currently driven by free trials and deferred revenue deals) -- saying \"when a platform delivers real value, you don't have to give it away.\" Unfortunately, CrowdStrike's recent software blunder might just drive some companies to try out Palo Alto's more diversified mix of on-site and cloud-based services instead.\n\nAt the time, CrowdStrike expected its revenue to grow 30%-31% in fiscal 2025. It also planned to continue its five-quarter streak of profitability based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). But given those estimates (which will likely be reduced) and its current enterprise value of $67.5 billion, it still looks expensive at 17 times this year's sales.\n\nWill this outage impact CrowdStrike's long-term growth?\n\nThe big question now is how much this fiasco will throttle CrowdStrike's long-term growth. Bulls will argue that the company's leadership of the cloud-native cybersecurity space, its sticky cloud-based ecosystem, and the high costs of switching to another platform will prevent it from losing too many customers in the aftermath of the IT outage.\n\nHowever, Kurtz admitted it would take \"some time\" before the problem update was rolled back and all of the affected systems were fully restored. CrowdStrike could also be hit by plenty of lawsuits after this debacle, and Tesla's CEO Elon Musk said his company had already \"deleted CrowdStrike\" from all of its systems.\n\nThe incident also made CrowdStrike, which hadn't been widely recognized outside of tech and business circles, a household name in the worst possible way. Warren Buffett once said it \"takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it\" -- and the damage to CrowdStrike's brand could certainly erode its defenses against its eager competitors.\n\nMicrosoft has been quietly expanding its own cloud-based cybersecurity platform over the past few years, with big investments and acquisitions. This embarrassing incident could drive Microsoft to accelerate the development of those internal services, in order to curb its dependence on CrowdStrike and other third-party cybersecurity platforms.\n\nSo is CrowdStrike's pullback a buying opportunity?\n\nI own shares of CrowdStrike, but I think it would need to pull back even further before it's considered a bargain. It's still up more than 90% over the past 12 months and isn't cheap -- and we can't yet gauge the long-term impact of this disastrous outage.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "After the Biggest IT Outage in History, Is CrowdStrike a Stock to Avoid...or a Bad-News Buy?",
        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) made headlines around the world on Friday -- but not for a reason the company or its shareholders were happy about. A faulty software update by the cybersecurity specialist led to an IT outage that impacted customers around the world, from airlines to banks to hospitals, causing business for many of them to screech to a halt.\n\nExperts are calling this the largest IT outage in history, and though CrowdStrike rushed into action and deployed a fix, problems persisted across systems. The company repaired the software bug, but affected computers require manual reboots -- a process that could take some time.\n\nInvestors responded by selling CrowdStrike stock, driving it 11% lower in Friday's trading session. Now, the question is, following this major upset for CrowdStrike customers worldwide, is the stock one to avoid...or is it a bad-news buy? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat happened at CrowdStrike?\n\nFirst, let's take a quick look at CrowdStrike's business and at exactly what happened over the past few days. CrowdStrike stands out in the world of cybersecurity because its platform is entirely cloud-based and driven by artificial intelligence (AI). The Falcon platform collects data from across a company, and this information is used to train CrowdStrike's AI to protect that customer from threats. Customers can select from among 28 security modules or use them all in one Falcon platform.\n\nAs of the end of the first quarter, 62 of the Fortune 100 companies were using CrowdStrike as their choice of cybersecurity provider. The company recently said deals involving modules such as Falcon Next-Gen SIEM more than doubled year over year, and it's been signing some of its biggest contracts ever.\n\nFast-forward to the early morning hours of July 19. CrowdStrike launched a sensor configuration update to Microsoft Windows systems -- something that's done regularly across the Falcon platform. This time, though, the update sparked a logic error. The result was a system crash, leading to the blue screens seen by customers around the world.\n\nCrowdStrike quickly fixed the software error, but as mentioned above, the need for manual reboots means it will take time for all systems to return to normal operations. The impact has been broad-based -- from canceled flights and surgeries to TV channels being unable to broadcast.\n\nPotential impact on CrowdStrike\n\nNow, let's consider the potential impact on CrowdStrike. First, here's a very important point: The troubles weren't linked to a cyberattack. They were simply the result of a faulty software update. This is key because it doesn't call into question CrowdStrike's ability to do its job of protecting companies from such attacks. And though this software bug created chaos, unfortunately these sorts of events do happen from time to time -- and have happened to other companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, the outage is still likely to have some financial impact on CrowdStrike, but it's too early to determine exactly how much. A look at the company's terms and conditions shows it limits its liability to \"fees paid\" by the customer -- which could greatly reduce potential damages. But this is just a small part of the picture. CrowdStrike may have negotiated other terms with certain clients, and the company still could face the threat of lawsuits or the loss of contracts.\n\nYour investment strategy\n\nSo, what does all of this mean for you as an investor right now? Is CrowdStrike a stock to avoid or a bad-news buy? This depends on your investment strategy. If you're a cautious investor, before picking up shares, you may want to at least wait until CrowdStrike's next earnings report to learn more about potential financial impact on the company.\n\nIf you can tolerate some risk, though, now is a great time to scoop up shares of this cybersecurity giant. As mentioned above, technical glitches do happen -- and this one doesn't have anything to do with CrowdStrike's ability to protect its customers from cyberattacks.\n\nThe fact that this software bug did shut down so much business shows just how big CrowdStrike has become, extending across companies and industries around the world. Could CrowdStrike lose some customers after this event? It's certainly possible, though customers do realize that software bugs are risks -- regardless of your security provider.\n\nFinally, it's important to take a look both at CrowdStrike's solid earnings growth, and at two key metrics -- free cash flow and return on invested capital: CRWD Net Income (Annual) Chart\n\nAll of these figures are extremely positive; they show that CrowdStrike is making wise investments and benefiting from them.\n\nEven if CrowdStrike faces some financial headwinds in the aftermath of the big outage, the company has what it takes to handle the challenges, and should prevail over the long term. All of this means that, yes, CrowdStrike could be in for a rough patch in the weeks and months to come, but the recent problem shouldn't dismantle the strengths the company has built over time.\n\nAnd this means that, for investors able to handle some risk, CrowdStrike today is a bad-news buy -- not a stock to avoid.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Chinese cybersecurity companies are taking advantage of the massive Microsoft Windows outage that upended businesses and grounded flights around the world on Thursday and Friday by promoting their own software, as Beijing pushes to cut the country's reliance on foreign suppliers.\n\nAustin, Texas-based cybersecurity company CrowdStrike caused the outage, one of the largest in history, by pushing a bad software update that crashed the Windows operating system. It affected airports, banks, and hospitals, among many other businesses.\n\n360 Security Technology, China's largest cybersecurity firm, took the opportunity to promote its products, which it claimed were \"more reliable, stable, comprehensive and intelligent\".\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: Xinhua>\n\nQAX, another well-known firm in the sector, wrote in a blog post on Friday that \"software vendors involved in system stability need to have stricter quality control of their software\".\n\nTencent Holdings, which operates the Tencent PC Manager platform, said on Friday that it received reports from some users who experienced the Windows error screen, known as the blue screen of death. It referred users to CrowdStrike's official workaround steps to resolve the problem.\n\nThe incident adds to Beijing's list of reasons for seeking to move away from foreign technology as it pursues technological self-reliance in the face of mounting export restrictions and sanctions from Washington. Key infrastructure was largely unaffected in China, where only foreign businesses and luxury hotels were hit.\n\nWhile Microsoft said on Friday that its systems had been restored, many businesses continued to deal with the fallout.\n\nThe Hong Kong International Airport, whose passenger check-in system collapsed, issued a notice on Saturday saying operations had returned to normal.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina's cybersecurity market is dominated by local players. Beijing has long been phasing out software from companies like Russia's Kaspersky Lab and US-based Symantec. CrowdStrike does not sell products and services in China, according to its website.\n\nCrowdStrike shares fell 11.1 per cent to US$304.96 on the Nasdaq on Friday, while Microsoft edged down 0.74 per cent. Competitors SentinelOne and Palo Alto Networks gained 7.85 per cent and 2.16 per cent, respectively.\n\nWhile China has pursued technological self-reliance to varying degrees for decades, the government's mistrust of foreign commercial software deepened after the 2013 leaks from US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed methods that the National Security Agency used to access information from some of the world's biggest tech companies.\n\nThe government made a concerted push to completely switch to domestic security software a decade ago, according to a 2014 report by state-owned China News Service.\n\nAll the departments of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology have installed 360 software, the report said, and state-owned enterprises would follow by also installing domestic alternatives.\n\nCrowdStrike has made monitoring for Chinese cyberattacks an important part of its business, as Western countries have warned of an increasing number of attacks coming from China-linked actors.\n\nIn 2015, the company reported seven Chinese cyberattacks against US technology and pharmaceutical companies. China's foreign affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at the time that \"the Chinese government would not in any way participate, encourage or support enterprises in engaging in the theft of trade secrets\".\n\nIn its latest annual report, CrowdStrike said that \"China-nexus adversaries increasingly targeted third-party relationships\" in 2023.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "As the world continues to recover from massive business and travel disruptions caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, malicious actors are trying to exploit the situation for their own gain.\n\nGovernment cybersecurity agencies across the globe and CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz are warning businesses and individuals about new phishing schemes that involve malicious actors posing as CrowdStrike employees or other tech specialists offering to assist those recovering from the outage.\n\n\u201cWe know that adversaries and bad actors will try to exploit events like this,\u201d Kurtz said in a statement. \u201cI encourage everyone to remain vigilant and ensure that you\u2019re engaging with official CrowdStrike representatives.\u201d\n\nThe UK Cyber Security Center said they have noticed an increase in phishing attempts around this event.\n\nMicrosoft said 8.5 million devices running its Windows operating system were affected by the faulty cybersecurity update Friday that led to worldwide disruptions. That\u2019s less than 1% of all Windows-based machines, Microsoft cybersecurity executive David Weston said in a blog post on Saturday.\n\nHe also said such a significant disturbance is rare but \u201cdemonstrates the interconnected nature of our broad ecosystem.\u201d\n\nWhat's happening with air travel?\n\nWith their tightly timed, interwoven schedules and complex technology systems, many big airlines struggle to stay on time when everything goes well. It perhaps was not surprising that the industry was among the hardest hit by the outage, with crews and planes caught out of position.\n\nBy mid-afternoon Saturday on the U.S. East Coast, airlines around the world had canceled more than 2,000 flights, according to tracking service FlightAware. That was down from 5,100-plus cancellations on Friday.\n\nAbout 1,600 of Saturday\u2019s canceled flights occurred in the United States, where carriers scrambled to get planes and crews back into position after massive disruptions the day before. According to travel data provider Cirium, U.S. carriers canceled about 3.5% of their scheduled flights for Saturday. Only Australia was hit harder.\n\nCanceled flights were running at about 1% in the United Kingdom, France and Brazil and about 2% in Canada, Italy and India among major air-travel markets.\n\nRobert Mann, a former airline executive and now a consultant in the New York area, said it was unclear exactly why U.S. airlines were suffering disproportionate cancellations, but possible causes include a greater degree of outsourcing of technology and more exposure to Microsoft operating systems that received the faulty upgrade from CrowdStrike.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhich airlines are getting hit the hardest?\n\nDelta Air Lines canceled more than 800 flights, or one-fourth of its schedule for Saturday, and that number did not include Delta Connection regional flights. It was followed by United Airlines, which dropped nearly 400 flights.\n\nThe worst airport to be, for a second straight day, was Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport, where Delta is the dominant carrier. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that thousands of people spent the night at the airport, many sleeping on the floors.\n\nEuropean airlines and airports appeared to be recovering slowly, although Lufthansa and its affiliates canceled dozens of flights. Its Eurowings budget subsidiary said check-in, boarding, booking and rebooking flights were all available again, although \u201cisolated disruptions\u201d were possible.\n\nLondon\u2019s Heathrow Airport said it was busy but operating normally on Saturday and that \u201call systems are back up and running.\" Flights at Berlin\u2019s main airport were departing on or close to schedule, German Press Agency dpa reported, citing an airport spokesman.\n\nHow are healthcare systems holding up?\n\nHealth care systems affected by the outage faced clinic closures, canceled surgeries and appointments and restricted access to patient records.\n\nCedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, Calif., said \u201csteady progress has been made\u201d to bring its servers back online and thanked its patients for being flexible during the crisis.\n\n\u201cOur teams will be working actively through the weekend as we continue to resolve remaining issues in preparation for the start of the work week,\u201d the hospital wrote in a statement.\n\nIn Austria, a leading organization of doctors said the outage exposed the vulnerability of relying on digital systems. Harald Mayer, vice president of the Austrian Chamber of Doctors, said the outage showed that hospitals need analog backups to protect patient care.\n\nThe organization also called on governments to impose high standards in patient data protection and security, and on health providers to train staff and put systems in place to manage crises.\n\n\u201cHappily, where there were problems, these were kept small and short-lived and many areas of care were unaffected\u201d in Austria, Mayer said.\n\nThe Schleswig-Holstein University Hospital in northern Germany, which canceled all elective procedures Friday, said Saturday that systems were gradually being restored and that elective surgery could resume by Monday.\n\nWill the tech industry face a reckoning?\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t that surprised that an accident caused severe global digital disruption. I was a little surprised that the cause of it was a software update from a very well-respected cybersecurity company,\u201d said Oxford University management professor Ciaran Martin, a former chief executive of the U.K.\u2019s National Cyber Security Center.\n\n\u201cThere are some very hard questions for CrowdStrike. How on earth did this update get through quality control?\" he said. \"Clearly the testing regime, whatever it is, failed.\u201d\n\nMartin said governments in the U.K. and the European Union will be powerless to take steps to prevent such breakdowns \u201cbecause we have become dependent on a very American version of technology, and the power to do anything about that doesn\u2019t rest in this continent.\u201d\n\nOther analysts doubted that the outage would lead Washington or any other government to propose new mandates on tech companies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the mandate would be. Do better QA?\u201d said Gartner analyst Eric Grenier, using an acronym for quality assurance.\n\nWhat did scam artists learn from the outage?\n\nGrenier expects that a majority of affected machines will be fixed in about a week, with more time needed to reach laptops used by far-flung workers because the work can\u2019t be done remotely \u2013 it\u2019s a hands-on operation.\n\nIn the meantime, there will be scammers trying to take advantage of businesses that have indicated they were affected by the outage.\n\n\u201cThe threat is very real,\u201d Grenier said. \u201cBad actors have the information to send targeted phishing emails and calls. They know what endpoint-protection tools you use. They know you use CrowdStrike.\u201d\n\nGrenier said affected businesses need to make sure they use a fix supplied by CrowdStrike. \u201cDon\u2019t accept the help of somebody coming out of the blue and saying, \u2018I\u2019ll fix that for you,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nIsabella O\u2019Malley in Philadelphia, Stephen Graham in Berlin and Technology writer Matt O'Brien contributed to this report.",

The outages led to long queues at airports (Andrew Milligan/PA)\n\nProfessor Ciaran Martin, the former chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), said \u201cthe worst\u201d of the outage was over but countries would \u201chave to learn to cope\u201d with future flaws.\n\nThe NCSC said affected organisations should \u201cput in place vendor mitigations\u201d, adding it was also warning about \u201can increase in related phishing\u201d as \u201copportunistic malicious actors seek to take advantage of the situation\u201d.\n\nChartered security professional James Bore said there would be \u201clingering effects\u201d from the outage.\n\nMr Bore told Sky News: \u201cIf you\u2019ve only got one IT person in the company and 2,000 employees it\u2019s not going to be fixed overnight.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be weeks of work for that person just travelling around or getting everyone to come in and sort out their laptops.\u201d",

        "title": "How a faulty CrowdStrike update crashed computers around the world",
        "content": "Airlines, banks, hospitals and other risk-averse organizations around the world chose cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to protect their computer systems from hackers and data breaches.\n\nBut all it took was one faulty CrowdStrike software update to cause global disruptions Friday that grounded flights, knocked banks and media outlets offline, and disrupted hospitals, retailers and other services.\n\n\u201cThis is a function of the very homogenous technology that goes into the backbone of all of our IT infrastructure,\u201d said Gregory Falco, an assistant professor of engineering at Cornell University. \u201cWhat really causes this mess is that we rely on very few companies, and everybody uses the same folks, so everyone goes down at the same time.\u201d\n\nThe trouble with the update issued by CrowdStrike and affecting computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system was not a hacking incident or cyberattack, according to CrowdStrike, which apologized and said a fix was on the way.\n\nBut it wasn't an easy fix. It required \u201cboots on the ground\u201d to remediate, said Gartner analyst Eric Grenier.\n\n\u201cThe fix is working, it\u2019s just a very manual process and there\u2019s no magic key to unlock it,\u201d Grenier said. \u201cI think that is probably what companies are struggling with the most here.\u201d\n\nWhile not everyone is a client of CrowdStrike and its platform known as Falcon, it is one of the leading cybersecurity providers, particularly in transportation, healthcare, banking and other sectors that have a lot at stake in keeping their computer systems working.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re usually risk-averse organizations that don\u2019t want something that\u2019s crazy innovative, but that can work and also cover their butts when something goes wrong. That\u2019s what CrowdStrike is,\u201d Falco said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re looking around at their colleagues in other sectors and saying, \u2018Oh, you know, this company also uses that, so I\u2019m gonna need them, too.\u2019\u201d\n\nWorrying about the fragility of a globally connected technology ecosystem is nothing new. It's what drove fears in the 1990s of a technical glitch that could cause chaos at the turn of the millennium.\n\n\u201cThis is basically what we were all worried about with Y2K, except it\u2019s actually happened this time,\u201d wrote Australian cybersecurity consultant Troy Hunt on the social platform X.\n\nAcross the world Friday, affected computers were showing the \u201cblue screen of death\u201d \u2014 a sign that something went wrong with Microsoft's Windows operating system.\n\nBut what's different now is \u201cthat these companies are even more entrenched,\u201d Falco said. \"We like to think that we have a lot of players available. But at the end of the day, the biggest companies use all the same stuff.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nFounded in 2011 and publicly traded since 2019, CrowdStrike describes itself in its annual report to financial regulators as having \u201creinvented cybersecurity for the cloud era and transformed the way cybersecurity is delivered and experienced by customers.\u201d It emphasizes its use of artificial intelligence in helping to keep pace with adversaries. It reported having 29,000 subscribing customers at the start of the year.\n\nThe Austin, Texas-based firm is one of the more visible cybersecurity companies in the world and spends heavily on marketing, including Super Bowl ads. At cybersecurity conferences, it's known for large booths displaying massive action-figure statues representing different state-sponsored hacking groups that CrowdStrike technology promises to defend against.\n\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz is among the most highly compensated in the world, recording more than $230 million in total compensation in the last three years. Kurtz is also a driver for a CrowdStrike-sponsored car racing team.\n\nAfter his initial statement about the problem was criticized for lack of contrition, Kurtz apologized in a later social media post Friday and on NBC's \u201cToday Show.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,\u201d he said on X.\n\nRichard Stiennon, a cybersecurity industry analyst, said this was a historic mistake by CrowdStrike.\n\n\u201cThis is easily the worst faux pas, technical faux pas or glitch of any security software provider ever,\u201d said Stiennon, who has tracked the cybersecurity industry for 24 years.\n\nWhile the problem is an easy technical fix, he said, it\u2019s impact could be long-lasting for some organizations because of the hands-on work needed to fix each affected computer. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really difficult to touch millions of machines. And people are on vacation right now, so, you know, the CEO will be coming back from his trip to the Bahamas in a couple of weeks and he won\u2019t be able to use his computers.\u201d\n\nStiennon said he did not think the outage revealed a bigger problem with the cybersecurity industry or CrowdStrike as a company.\n\n\u201cThe markets are going to forgive them, the customers are going to forgive them, and this will blow over,\u201d he said.\n\nForrester analyst Allie Mellen credited CrowdStrike for clearly telling customers what they need to do to fix the problem. But to restore trust, she said there will need to be a deeper look at what occurred and what changes can be made to prevent it from happening again.\n\n\u201cA lot of this is likely to come down to the testing and software development process and the work that they\u2019ve put into testing these kinds of updates before deployment,\u201d Mellen said. \u201cBut until we see the complete retrospective, we won\u2019t know for sure what the failure was.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Alan Suderman in Richmond, Virginia, contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Experts have warned it could take weeks for systems to fully recover from a global outage which has seen disruption including flight delays and cancellations.\n\nA flawed update rolled out by CrowdStrike, one of the world\u2019s largest cybersecurity providers, knocked many offline around the world on Friday, causing flight and train cancellations and crippling some healthcare systems.\n\nHere is a closer look at what we know about the incident.\n\n\u2013 What exactly has happened?\n\nCrowdStrike chief executive George Kurtz confirmed the issue was caused by a \u201cdefect in a single content update for Windows hosts\u201d \u2013 in short, a flaw in a software \u201csensor configuration\u201d update pushed out to customers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said a fix had been deployed for a bug in an update which affected Microsoft Windows PCs, causing many to crash, some displaying the so-called \u201cblue screen of death\u201d, and become unusable. CrowdStrike confirmed Apple Mac and Linux users were unaffected\n\nIT infrastructure at businesses and institutions around the world collapsed, taking many businesses and their online services offline.\n\nIn an interview with NBC\u2019s Today Show in the US, Mr Kurtz said the incident was not a cyber attack, while a technical statement from CrimeStrike on Saturday said a \u201csensor configuration\u201d had \u201ctriggered a logic error\u201d which the company said had been corrected. Passengers in the South Terminal at Gatwick Airport (Brian Lawless/PA)\n\n\u2013 What is the scale of the impact?\n\nSubstantial \u2013 around the world, banks, supermarkets and other major institutions saw services disrupted, while many businesses were unable to take digital payments or access key databases.\n\nNHS England said \u201cthe majority of GP practices\u201d had experienced disruption and ambulance services reported increases in 999 and NHS 111 calls from patients who were unable to contact other NHS providers, while the National Pharmacy Association said pharmacies had seen issues \u201cincluding the accessing of prescriptions from GPs and medicine deliveries\u201d.\n\nAirlines reported being unable to process passengers and resorted to manually checking in customers at airports around the world with 167 flights departing from the UK and 171 incoming cancelled on Friday. Aviation analytics company Cirium said 5,078 flights \u2013 or 4.6% of those scheduled \u2013 were cancelled globally.\n\nStory continues\n\nGovia Thameslink Railway warned passengers to expect disruption because of \u201cwidespread IT issues\u201d while Sky News was forced off air briefly on Friday morning, while customers faced issues with attempting to pay using cards.\n\n\u2013 How has CrowdStrike responded?\n\nMr Kurtz said he is \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the situation and said CrowdStrike was \u201cactively working\u201d with those impacted.\n\nSaying the issue had been \u201cidentified\u201d and that a \u201cfix has been deployed\u201d, he said his team was \u201cfully mobilised to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers\u201d.

        "content": "By Zeba Siddiqui\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Security experts said CrowdStrike's routine update of its widely used cybersecurity software, which caused clients' computer systems to crash globally on Friday, apparently did not undergo adequate quality checks before it was deployed.\n\nThe latest version of its Falcon Sensor software was meant make CrowdStrike clients' systems more secure against hacking by updating the threats it defends against. But faulty code in the update files resulted in one of the most widespread tech outages in recent years for companies using Microsoft's Windows operating system.\n\nGlobal banks, airlines, hospitals and government offices were disrupted. CrowdStrike released information to fix affected systems, but experts said getting them back online would take time as it required manually weeding out the flawed code.\n\n\"What it looks like is, potentially, the vetting or the sandboxing they do when they look at code, maybe somehow this file was not included in that or slipped through,\" said Steve Cobb, chief security officer at Security Scorecard, which also had some systems impacted by the issue.\n\nProblems came to light quickly after the update was rolled out on Friday, and users posted pictures on social media of computers with blue screens displaying error messages. These are known in the industry as \"blue screens of death.\"\n\nPatrick Wardle, a security researcher who specialises in studying threats against operating systems, said his analysis identified the code responsible for the outage.\n\nThe update's problem was \"in a file that contains either configuration information or signatures,\" he said. Such signatures are code that detects specific types of malicious code or malware.\n\n\"It's very common that security products update their signatures, like once a day... because they're continually monitoring for new malware and because they want to make sure that their customers are protected from the latest threats,\" he said.\n\nThe frequency of updates \"is probably the reason why (CrowdStrike) didn't test it as much,\" he said.\n\nIt's unclear how that faulty code got into the update and why it wasn't detected before being released to customers.\n\n\"Ideally, this would have been rolled out to a limited pool first,\" said John Hammond, principal security researcher at Huntress Labs. \"That is a safer approach to avoid a big mess like this.\"\n\nOther security companies have had similar episodes in the past. McAfee's buggy antivirus update in 2010 stalled hundreds of thousands of computers.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the global impact of this outage reflects CrowdStrike's dominance. Over half of Fortune 500 companies and many government bodies such as the top U.S. cybersecurity agency itself, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, use the company's software.\n\n(Reporting by Zeba Siddiqui in San Francisco; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",

        "title": "A risky trade-off made\u00a0CrowdStrike\u2019s\u00a0outage so devastating \u2014 cybersecurity leaders say there\u2019s no easy fix",
        "content": "When Michael Armer's phone started blowing up at 4 a.m. Friday morning, he \"freaked out.\" Armer, the chief information security officer at RingCentral, was receiving notifications about a stunning computer outage that was knocking down airport, bank, and hospital tech systems like dominos.\n\nThe scope of the chaos raised fears of a major cybersecurity breach or a state-sponsored attack. \"That\u2019s enough to get your blood flowing really quickly,\" Armer said.\n\nIt turns out that the massive computer outage was not the work of nefarious hackers. It was the result of a glitch in a routine software update by security company CrowdStrike. \"We were all very fortunate that this was related to one of their standardized and automated software deployments,\" Armer says of the CrowdStrike update snafu.\n\nBut along with the relief that the disruption was not a cyber attack, the incident has highlighted the fragility and frightening interconnectedness of the technology modern society depends on \u2014 and the extent of the danger posed by today's convoluted system of software updates which security experts say stretches staff thin at even the largest organizations and forces a constant balancing act of risky trade-offs.\n\nThe problem with patches\n\nSecurity software like CrowdStrike provide \u201cpatches,\u201d or software updates, when threats are detected. Given the number of hackers probing companies' systems and devising new lines of attack, the need for patches is constant \u2014 sometimes as many as several times a day. Organizations move quickly and often automate these updates to ensure that there are no holes in their protective shields.\n\nThe problem is that new software is like an untested pharmaceutical drug - each new line of code could have a bug or defect that causes problems, unexpected side effects, and dangerous interactions with other software. In an ideal situation, a company would take the time to test each software update before deploying it to all their computers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really difficult conundrum, you cannot keep up with the number,\u201d said a CISO at a top law firm in New York City. \"Sometimes you have to put out a security patch because it\u2019s critical and you\u2019ve got vendors breathing down your neck and there\u2019s no way to [test] it,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes there are several updates within a 24-hour period so you\u2019d be caught in a recursive circle of testing where you would just never be done.\u201d\n\nFor many in-house security teams, that means striking a balance between speed and risk. \u201cThe antivirus products are pushing up multiple updates per day because in some ways we've pushed them into a corner,\u201d said Paul Davis, field CISO at software supply chain platform JFrog. \"The faster that they can respond to detect a piece of software or malicious activity, the better they are. So that being the case, then the requirement to test multiple times a day becomes onerous.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe real challenge, he said, is how to protect the organization that is responding to cybersecurity threats which can spread in hours, or even minutes, and at the same time make sure those software updates are tested. \u201cWe have to test the basic functionality of the software, but we rely on these automated updates to be safe, and it\u2019s almost like a calculated risk.\u201d\n\nHands-on CPR for each affected computer\n\nThe New York City law firm uses more than 30 separate security tools from a variety of vendors that run on laptops, desktops or servers. Normally, if an update causes problems, the software vendor will deploy a fix that an organization can quickly push to thousands of computers within the same day.\n\nBut because of the nature of the CrowdStrike flaw however, that wasn't possible. The flaw essentially caused computers running Microsoft Windows to freeze up and display the dreaded \"blue screen of death.\" Affected systems needed to be brought back to life, one by one.\n\n\u201cYou have to physically walk over to every computer and power it down and then bring it up, and when the screen comes up, you have to hit F3 to go into what they call Safe Mode and then go and delete a file somewhere,\u201d the New York law firm CISO explained. \u201cIt's just a nightmare.\u201d\n\nSome CISOs, however, put the bulk of the blame on Microsoft, not on Crowdstrike\u2013 and even avoid Windows altogether if they can. \u201cIn Silicon Valley, tech companies tend to avoid Windows,\u201d said the CISO of a medium-sized AI company, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of discussing security mitigations. He said that it is because of the design of Windows in its core architecture that leads to malware, spyware and the driver instability that occurred today as a result of the Crowdstrike flawed update.\n\n\u201cCrowdStrike has clear process improvements to make, obviously, but it should not be possible in 2024 to have a kernel [core architecture] which is destabilized by a third party,\u201d he said. \u201cMicrosoft has had a bad year, from a security perspective, and they have to win the trust of the ecosystem back.\u201d Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment other than pointing to its existing statement about the outage.\n\nIn a statement posted online Friday, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized for the incident, which he said involved a \"content update for Windows hosts,\" noting that Mac and Linux hosts were not affected. \r\n\"All of CrowdStrike understands the gravity and impact of the situation. We quickly identified the issue and deployed a fix, allowing us to focus diligently on restoring customer systems as our highest priority.\"\n\nPost-game analysis\n\nJFrog\u2019s Davis pushed back on the idea that a typical organization could get away with not using Windows. \u201cWindows is still the predominant operating system,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you join a company, you\u2019re [usually] offered either a Windows machine or a Mac machine.\u201d\n\nJohn Paul Cunningham, CISO at identity security company Silverfort, said that Friday's outage should be a wake-up for call for organizations, and make companies more leery of automated software updates. In Cunningham's view, all threats are not created equal and companies can exercise more discretion by not always defaulting to the automated updates.\n\n\u201cCompanies like CrowdStrike often suggest doing auto updates with this premise that staying on the most current release of the product is more secure,\" he said. But companies can take more time to test it before pushing it out, he said, even if it takes a little more work. \u201cAs long as the security team knows there is an update, they can push it out manually\u2013the update itself is still automatic.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is that for most cybersecurity leaders, figuring out how to strike a balance\u2014between risk and speed, and between operating systems\u2014will require some post-game analysis and decision-making, said RingCentral's Armer.\n\nAnd while getting a grip on software updates is important, he noted that companies should also be thankful Friday's outage was not even worse. \u201cI personally am thankful that it wasn't a state-sponsored attack,\" he said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Doctors revert to pen and paper after CrowdStrike\u2019s outage hits hospitals: \u2018Every single computer was down\u2019",
        "content": "Dr. Rian Kabir, a third-year psychiatry resident at the University of Louisville, always arrives to the school\u2019s outpatient mental health clinic early. He likes to come prepared, having reviewed his patients\u2019 charts and which medications they're taking before they arrive for their appointments. But today\u2014following a global tech outage that begin in the early morning hours\u2014that was impossible.\n\n\u201cWhen I came in, every single computer was down,\u201d Dr. Kabir says, noting that he couldn\u2019t review electronic patient records, couldn\u2019t access the drug monitoring program he uses, or even submit prescriptions to pharmacies electronically. His team has reverted to handwriting everything on paper\u2014like medical staff did a century ago\u2014and it has slowed down everything in the clinic. \u201cThis is pretty insane,\u201d Dr. Kabir says.\n\nThe tech outage, which is due to an apparent faulty software update from cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike, has sowed chaos across the nation's healthcare system. The damage shows how intertwined technology has become with 21st century medical care, and how one glitch can send the healthcare industry into a tailspin.\n\nMany hospitals and labs across the U.S. and globally have had their systems shut down, leading some hospitals to cancel or delay procedures and surgeries. Medical staff at many facilities have had to revert to documenting everything via pen and paper and calling in prescriptions.\n\nBoston-based Brigham and Women's Hospital canceled all previously scheduled non-urgent surgeries, procedures, and medical visits. Cone Health, a health-care network in North Carolina, canceled treatments, procedures, and surgeries. Corewell Health, a Michigan-based health care system, issued an alert to customers that many of its computers had been impacted and that procedures and appointments could be delayed. Even labs like Labcorp said the outage impacted their ability to deliver lab results to physicians and patients\u2014which could potentially result in delays for hospital discharges or admissions as well as treatment.\n\nEmergency rooms have largely stayed open to provide critical care, although they have faced the same computer system snaufs. Meanwhile, some healthcare providers, like Midwestern health care system Mercy Health, have managed to avoid the upheaval, saying they hadn\u2019t been impacted by the outage at all.\n\nSystem shutdowns aren't unknown in the medical industry. In fact, they\u2019re so frequent due to faulty software updates or cybersecurity attacks that there have been several studies conducted on the effect of the resulting delays and how to manage the fallout. Just earlier this year, Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago went offline for weeks after a cyberattack exposed its patient data.\n\nStory continues\n\nDr. Kabir recalled a cyberattack at the private hospital where he was working a year ago that also forced doctors and nurses to revert to updating patient records in writing. At the time, Dr. Kabir said cardiologists were unable to review electrocardiograms, the critical tests that measure electrical activity of the heart. \"I\u2019d say most people have done it at least one or two times,\u201d he said.\n\nIronically, hospitals and clinics are using companies like CrowdStrike specifically to avoid these sorts of shutdowns and bolster the safety of the often outdated tech systems they rely on. The CrowdStrike episode has underscored that system shutdowns may be unavoidable.\n\nThe healthcare industry is just one of many industry's slammed by the outage. The glitch has shaken the entire global economy\u2014impacting everything from airlines to television stations to government agencies. \u201cMy morning started with a 4 a.m. call from the Situation Room to highlight the issue that occurred with CrowdStrike,\u201d Anne Neuberger, Deputy Assistant to President Biden and Deputy National Security Advisor for cyber and emerging technologies, said on stage this morning at the Aspen Security Forum, when asked about the outage.\n\nBy mid-afternoon on Friday, the tech outages had improved for some of the impacted hospitals. Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital, which had canceled appointments earlier in the day, said in an announcement in the afternoon that its operations had \u201cbeen restored with some minor exceptions that we are actively addressing and we expect to be resolved soon.\u201d\n\nBut not for everybody: \u201cMy computer is still down,\u201d Dr. Kabir said Friday afternoon.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "A passenger waits at Gatwick Airport as flights were hit by delays and cancellations following the global IT outage - Benjamin Cremel/AFP\n\nHundreds of thousands of people have had their foreign summer holidays thrown into jeopardy by a global IT outage that caused chaos at British airports on Friday.\n\nAround 200,000 people are set to be hit by delays and cancellations caused by the IT meltdown, which was triggered by a faulty update to a widely-used piece of cyber security software. Many travel insurers are refusing to pay to rearrange holidays.\n\nNHS services, train services, cash machines and contactless payments were also taken offline, with 999 services facing long delays after GP surgeries were unable to make appointments.\n\nThe worldwide IT outage was caused by a glitch in cyber security software made by CrowdStrike, a US company, which caused millions of computers running Microsoft\u2019s Windows to crash suddenly on Friday morning.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt resulted in a so-called \u201cblue screen of death\u201d, sending the computers into recovery mode.\n\nAn emergency meeting of Cobra officials was called to address the chaos, and Louise Haigh, the Transport Secretary, said her department was \u201cworking at pace with industry and across Government on the issue\u201d.\n\nWhile most of the technical problems were resolved by Friday night, the impact on summer holidays is expected to last for days.\n\nFriday was scheduled to be the busiest day at British airports since October 2019 as schools broke up for the summer holidays.\n\nAs 5,078 flights were cancelled globally on Friday, including around 160 UK flights, passengers were hit with queues of more than three and a half hours.\n\nStaff at airports from Heathrow to Bangkok were forced to manually check-in travellers after the technical glitch sent their systems into meltdown. Edinburgh Airport halted all arriving flights for around two hours on Friday as aircraft backed up on the Tarmac.\n\nMeanwhile, Ryanair urged passengers to leave airports, saying: \u201cIf your flight has been cancelled, we kindly request that you leave the airport as the IT outage means we cannot currently assist passengers at the airport.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nDelta and United Airlines both imposed so-called ground stops on Friday morning, preventing flights from taking off while airline staff rushed to fix crippled computers.\n\nThe disruption is set to carry on into next week as airlines struggle to get aircraft and pilots back into position to run their scheduled services.\n\nPassengers who have had their flights cancelled also face problems if trying to recoup lost costs from travel insurers, as many do not cover accommodation if travel is disrupted. MoneySuperMarket, the comparison site, confirmed that there were likely to be hundreds of travel policies that would not provide any cover for Friday\u2019s events. Disruption is set to carry on into next week as airlines struggle to get aircraft and pilots back into position for scheduled services - Jack Taylor/Getty Images\n\nPaul Charles, a travel expert, said: \u201cIt will take until Monday to recover. It\u2019s turmoil that the industry doesn\u2019t need on one of the busiest weekends of the year.\u201d\n\nMr Charles estimated that 25,000 people were directly affected by the cancellation of nearly 300 flights to and from the UK.\n\nAirlines are responsible for arranging a replacement flight but may struggle to accommodate people, with travel experts warning that most flights were already expected to be fully booked.\n\nTravellers hoping to rebook their own travel faced having to arrange their own transfers, with routes to some popular destinations, such as Athens, no longer having direct flights available.\n\nGeorge Kurtz, the CrowdStrike chief executive, told NBC, the US broadcaster, he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the fault and admitted it would be \u201csome time\u201d before all the problems were resolved. He confirmed that the incident was not a cyber attack.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s software is widely used by businesses and is designed to protect companies from hacking, but a broken file included within a routine update to the technology almost immediately broke Windows computers that had the programme installed.\n\nThe company said it had since managed to fix the problem, but IT experts warned that many businesses were having to manually repair their computer systems.\n\nGP surgeries in Britain were unable to access patient records or book appointments, with the NHS advising people only to contact a doctor if their ailment was urgent.\n\nCancer appointments were cancelled at some hospitals as radiology departments were hit by the outage, and some NHS systems remained down on Friday evening. The National Pharmacy Association warned that disruption was likely to continue through the weekend, even when systems are back online, as outlets deal with a backlog of medicine deliveries.\n\nHolidaymakers hoping to use the railways for a getaway were also hit by the disruption. Thameslink, Southern Rail and Gatwick Express faced \u201cwidespread IT issues across our entire network\u201d that left bosses unable to tell drivers which trains they were meant to be working on.\n\nSouth Western Railway said all its ticket machines had stopped working on Friday morning. National Rail Enquiries advised passengers to \u201cpurchase your ticket online, on the train or speak to a member of station staff\u201d.\n\nOn the high street, card payment systems at Waitrose and Gail\u2019s, the bakery chain, stopped working, with staff having to take cash instead.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange\u2019s in-house news service went offline, while Sky News was forced to pull its morning broadcast and replace it with pre-recorded footage.\n\nAdam Leon Smith, a cyber security expert at the British Computer Society, said it could take \u201cdays and weeks\u201d for some companies to get back online, while Ciaran Martin, a former head of GCHQ\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, estimated that the economic damage from the glitch would \u201crun into the billions\u201d.\n\n07:12 PM BST\n\nWrapping up...\n\nThanks for joining us on this live coverage of a widespread technology outage, which affected companies and services around the world, grounding flights, knocking GP systems offline and preventing many people from paying for their shopping.\n\nAt the heart of the massive disruption is CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that provides software to scores of companies worldwide.\n\nThe company says the problem occurred when it deployed a faulty update to computers running Microsoft Windows, noting that the issue behind the outage was not a security incident or cyberattack.\n\n06:58 PM BST\n\nIT meltdown shows how horrifyingly exposed we are to total economic collapse\n\nOver-dependence on cloud software has left the world one glitch away from disaster, writes business columnist Matthew Lynn:\n\nThe planes stopped flying, the trains stopped running and countless other services were disrupted around the world.\n\nIt remains to be seen how long the outage that hit global computer systems on Friday lasts. With any luck, it will be fixed quickly and the damage will be relatively minor.\n\nAnd yet one point is surely clear: from the abolition of cash to the reliance on just-in-time supplies, we have become terrifyingly dependent on a tiny number of cloud-based computer systems.\n\nWe may be just one glitch away from a total economic collapse \u2013 and worst of all, for all the fashionable talk of \u201csecuronomics\u201d, our political leaders are just making that worse.\n\nOver the course of Friday, chaos rippled out across the world.\n\nRead the full article...\n\n06:56 PM BST\n\nPensions and ISAs giant Vanguard says services restored\n\nInvestment platform Vanguard has emailed customers to say that services have been restored. It said:\n\nWe are aware of technical issues you may have experienced on our UK Personal Investor platform today due to a 3rd party global IT issue.\n\nHowever, we are pleased to confirm our services have resumed and you can access your Vanguard account.\n\n06:51 PM BST\n\nGail\u2019s bakery investor attacks Crowdsource\n\nA serial restaurant entrepreneur who formerly chaired Channel 4 has attacked CrowdSource, expressing surprise that the cyber security business has not plunged by more on the stock market today.\n\nLuke Johnson is an investor in Gail\u2019s bakery, which was unable to accept card payments as a result of the outage. He noted that the CrowdSource\u2019s shares are highly priced compared to the business\u2019s earnings.\n\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t the shares collapsed 50pc or more?\u201d he said.\n\nShares are currently down 12.3pc.

Travel warns of potential for lost bags\n\nA traveller at Gatwick Airport said he had been queuing for more than three-and-a-half hours ahead of a flight to Miami, Florida.\n\nDean Seddon, 42, from Plymouth, told the PA news agency: \u201cThere are just people everywhere, there must be 400 people in this queue for the check-in desk I\u2019m at ... it\u2019s just bedlam.\u201d\n\nLance and Penny Spraggons said they had been waiting in a queue to check in at the West Sussex airport for more than an hour.\n\nMr Spraggons said: \u201cThe biggest problem is the lack of information.\u201d\n\nThe queue at Stansted snaked outside the main terminal building.\n\nCourtney Kemal, 32, who had been in the queue for around two hours by late morning, said her two sons aged five and seven were \u201cobviously getting stressed\u201d.\n\nRory Boland, editor of magazine Which? Travel, said passengers due to travel today \u201cwill naturally be deeply concerned\u201d.\n\nHe went on: \u201cIf you can, avoid checking in a bag as queues for check-in at the airport will be long and IT failures typically lead to lots of lost bags.\n\n\u201cIf you do check-in bags, make sure you keep medication, keys and any other essentials in your hand luggage.\u201d\n\nHe said passengers will not be eligible for compensation for delayed or cancelled fights due to the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d, but airlines have a duty to look after them, including providing meals, accommodation and alternative flight bookings if necessary.\n\n06:11 PM BST\n\nPharmacies warn of weekend disruption while outage hit 60pc of GP practices\n\nThe National Pharmacy Association has warned that disruption from today\u2019s IT outage is likely to continue through the weekend, even when systems are back online, as outlets deal with a backlog of medicine deliveries.\n\nThousands of GP practices have also been affected by the outage today, with NHS England confirming there has been an issue with the EMIS Web system, which is understood to be used by about 60pc of practices in England.\n\nA spokesperson for NHS England said:\n\nThe NHS has long-standing measures in place to manage the disruption, including using paper patient records and handwritten prescriptions, and the usual phone systems to contact your GP.\n\nThere is currently no known impact on 999 or emergency services, so people should use these services as they usually would.\n\nThere are also some issues with administrative systems in hospitals that mean staff are having to work manually from paper to manage certain tasks but in the majority of hospitals, care is continuing as normal.\n\nPatients should attend appointments unless told otherwise. Only contact your GP if it\u2019s urgent, and otherwise please use 111 online or call 111.\n\nProfessor Kamila Hawthorne, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said:\n\nOur members are telling us that today\u2019s outage is causing considerable disruption to GP practice bookings and IT systems - practices using EMIS IT systems appear to be particularly affected.\n\nOutages like this affect our access to important clinical information about our patients, as well as our ability to book tests, make referrals, and inform the most appropriate treatment plan.\n\nShe asked patients to \u201ctry and wait\u201d until the outage is resolved if their issue is not urgent.\n\nEMIS Web is the most widely used clinical system for primary care in the UK.\n\nIt enables GP practices to book appointments, examine records and manage admin.\n\n05:54 PM BST\n\nCancelled UK departures reach 143\n\nSome 143 flights scheduled to depart UK airports on Friday have been cancelled amid the global IT outage, aviation analytics company Cirium said.\n\nThis equates to 4.6pc of scheduled departures, the firm said, while 142 flights due to land in the UK were cancelled.\n\n05:52 PM BST\n\nCrowdStrike rivals jump on stock market\n\nRivals to CrowdStrike jumped on the stock market, while the company at the centre of today\u2019s outage has plunged.\n\nThe outage could force customers and investors alike to rethink their dependence on the company, opening the door to potential rivals like Palo Alto Networks, which saw its stock rise 1.7pc on Friday, and Sentinel One, which jumped as much as 3.6pc.\n\nGil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson, said:\n\nThis event is a reminder of how complex and intertwined our global computing systems are and how vulnerable they are to a mistake and an error.\n\nWhile most companies don\u2019t really have an alternative to Microsoft, they do have alternatives for security.\n\nThis may cause many companies to reconsider which security product they use, and whether they need to diversify across different security products in order to prevent these types of outages.\n\nHowever, other analysts said that while Friday\u2019s events had been damaging for CrowdStrike, they did not foresee competitors taking much market share as a result of the incident.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly a major black eye for CrowdStrike and the stock will be under pressure,\u201d said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, but he noted that the incident stemmed from a technical update and not a hack or cybersecurity threat, which he said would be \u201cmore worrying\u201d.\n\n05:42 PM BST\n\nOutage requires \u2018boots on the ground\u2019 to fix, says IT analyst\n\nFixing today\u2019s IT outage is not an easy fix, requiring \u201cboots on the ground\u201d to remediate, a leading analyst has said.\n\nEric Grenier of Gartner said:\n\nThe fix is working, it\u2019s just a very manual process and there\u2019s no magic key to unlock it. I think that is probably what companies are struggling with the most here.\n\nWhile not everyone is a client of CrowdStrike and its platform known as Falcon, it is one of the leading cybersecurity providers, particularly in the transportation and banking sectors that have a lot at stake in keeping their computer systems working.\n\nGregory Falco, an assistant professor of engineering at Cornell University, said:\n\nThey\u2019re usually risk-averse organisations that don\u2019t want something that\u2019s crazy innovative, but that can work and also cover their butts when something goes wrong. That\u2019s what CrowdStrike is. And they\u2019re looking around at their colleagues in other sectors and saying, \u201cOh, you know, this company also uses that, so I\u2019m gonna need them, too.\u201d\n\n05:33 PM BST\n\nElon Musk says CrowdStrike deleted from his systems\n\nThe billionaire behind Telsa, SpaceX and and social media giant X has posted: \u201cWe just deleted Crowdstrike from all our systems\u201d.\n\nWe just deleted Crowdstrike from all our systems, so no rollouts at all\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 19, 2024\n\n05:25 PM BST\n\nMicrosoft suggests turning computers off and on again\n\nWhile IT engineers are bogged down trying to fix thousands of broken computers, Microsoft says one solution may simply be to turn them off and on again. Matt Field reports:\n\nIn a technical update to customers, Microsoft said some \u201cvirtual machines\u201d - often used for home-working computers - could be fixed by repeatedly turning them off and on, 404media reported.\n\n\u201cWe have received feedback from customers that several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required, but overall feedback is that reboots are an effective troubleshooting step at this stage,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe high tech advice echoes that given in the Channel 4 show, The IT Crowd, in which Chris O\u2019Dowd\u2019s character\u2019s catchphrase is: \u201cHello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?\u201d\n\nIn the latest technical update from CrowdStrike, the company said the bug in its update was sent out at around 5.09am this morning, impacting millions of computers.\n\n05:16 PM BST\n\nNew York regulators say banks should be on high alert of cyber attacks\n\nNew York state regulators urged banks and companies to be on high alert amid the global tech outage on Friday, saying it is monitoring institutions and market events and working with other state and federal regulators.\n\nThe New York State Department of Financial Services \u201creminds all regulated entities to be vigilant at this time. Threat actors have been known to launch attacks during periods when IT and security staff are distracted, especially through social engineering,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nThe department supervises more than 3,000 financial institutions in New York.\n\n05:14 PM BST\n\nFixing the IT outage could take \u2018weeks\u2019, says industry expert\n\nIndustry expert Adam Leon Smith of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, warned that it could even take \u201cweeks\u201d for all computers and systems to be fully restored.\n\nHe said:\n\nThe fix will have to be applied to many computers around the world. So if computers are getting blue screens and endless loops, it could be more difficult and take days and weeks.\n\nMicrosoft Windows isn\u2019t the main OS for mission-critical systems, that\u2019s Linux - and so this could have been much worse.\n\nCrowdStrike had earlier confirmed that Linux and Apple Mac systems had not been impacted by the bug.\n\nThe flawed update caused major infrastructure to grind to a halt with computer systems knocked offline, and many devices were showing the so-called \u201cblue screen of death\u201d as they got stuck in an endless cycle of trying to reboot themselves, affecting key sectors across the country.\n\n05:09 PM BST\n\nMore than 2,600 flights cancelled so far\n\nOut of over 110,000 scheduled commercial flights on Friday, 2,691 have been cancelled globally so far and more are expected to be called off, according to data from global aviation analytics firm Cirium.\n\nIn Edinburgh, a Reuters witness said boarding pass scanners carried a \u201cserver offline message\u201d, with the airport saying passengers shouldn\u2019t travel to the airport without checking their flight status online first.\n\nElsewhere, airports and airlines advised customers to arrive earlier than normal for flights. Analysts said the outage was likely tied to a glitch in Microsoft software used globally.\n\nThe aviation sector is hit particularly hard due to its sensitivity to timings. Airlines rely on a closely coordinated schedule often run by air traffic control. Just one delay of a few minutes can throw off a flight schedule for take-offs and landings for an airport and airline for the rest of the day. A passenger waits in the check in area of Gatwick Airport as some flights are cancelled or delayed\n\n04:59 PM BST\n\nStock markets fall as outage rattled investors\n\nWorld stock markets fell on Friday as a global cyber outage rattled investors, with falls in Britain, continental Europe and the US.\n\nThe outage hit services from airlines to banks, unsettling markets further after a turbulent week.\n\nJeff Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said:\n\nToday\u2019s outages remind us that services can have supply chain disruptions too. While not a cyberattack, the outage is a worrisome reminder of how our systems are deeply integrated.\n\n04:57 PM BST\n\nHeathrow Airport \u2018working hard\u2019 to minimise effects of the outage\n\nHeathrow Airport said it is \u201cworking hard\u201d to get passengers \u201con their way\u201d following a major global IT outage. It added:\n\nWe continue to work with our airport colleagues to minimise the impact of the global IT outage on passenger journeys.\n\nFlights continue to be operational and passengers are advised to check with their airlines for the latest flight information.\n\n04:55 PM BST\n\nMicrosoft urges customers to follow Crowdstrike guidance\n\nMicrosoft has put out a statement saying:\n\nWe are aware of a scenario in which customers experience issues with their machines causing a bug check [blue screen] due to a recent CrowdStrike update. We recommend customers to follow guidance provided by CrowdStrike.\n\n04:52 PM BST\n\nAmbulance service receiving more calls amid IT outage\n\nThe North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) said it is experiencing a \u201chigher volume\u201d of calls from patients who are not able to contact other NHS providers following global IT issues.\n\nTaryn Lake, director of finance and digital at NEAS, said:\n\nSo far, we have experienced minor disruption to our services as the result of the national IT outage.\n\nWe are currently working with partners for the continuity of our service.\n\nHowever, we are experiencing a higher volume in calls from patients who are unable to contact other NHS providers and we are closely monitoring the situation.\n\nI am signing off at this point for a lie down and to get as far away from any computers as possible. I will hand over the reins to Alex Singleton.\n\n04:41 PM BST\n\nFlight cancelled or delayed? Here\u2019s what you need to know\n\nFlights around the world have been disrupted after a massive outage caused Windows computers to suddenly shut down.\n\nChief consumer and culture editor Nick Trend explains what you need to know about refunds and compensation:\n\nOn Ryanair\u2019s website, the company urged passengers to arrive at airports three hours early, blaming a \u201cthird-party IT issue, which is outside Ryanair\u2019s control and affecting all airlines operating across the network\u201d.\n\nTravellers at airports including Gatwick, Los Angeles and Madrid have shared photos on social media showing long queues as airlines grapple with increasing delays. Air passengers in India were even given hand-written boarding passes in an effort to keep things running smoothly.\n\nWhat are passengers caught up in the chaos entitled to? The detail around customer rights in this area is sometimes complicated, but the main principles are straightforward.\n\nFrom severe weather to tech outages and air traffic control issues, read your rights if your flight is cancelled or delayed.

Our ability to operate the electricity system and supply electricity remains unaffected. Our engineers have been and continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201d\n\nBritish Gas, which supplies gas to homes and businesses, said it had not experienced any problems, as did rivals Octopus Energy whose spokesman said: \u201cBoth Octopus and Kraken systems have been unaffected by the Microsoft system outage.\u201d [Kraken is the software designed by Octopus and used by other energy companies for managing bills and other systems.]\n\nOfgem, the energy industry regulator, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve experienced no IT impact as a result of the reported outage.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for National Gas, which manages much of the high pressure gas grid, said: \u201cWe are aware of the global IT issues currently affecting multiple companies. National Gas does not deploy the security software likely to be the root cause across any of its systems and is therefore not directly impacted by these events.\n\n\u201cWe remain in close contact with the wider industry and our supply chain to manage any residual impact and will continue to monitor our systems and operations closely.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for EDF, which runs the UK\u2019s nuclear power stations, said: \u201cEDF is not experiencing any direct impacts to critical business systems. We are supplying power and serving our customers as normal but will continue to monitor the situation.\u201d Nuclear sites were unaffected, it said.\n\nRWE, the German company that generates\u00a015pc of the UK\u2019s electricity via its fleet of gas-fired power stations, hydroelectric plants and several wind farms, said it was unaffected.\n\n04:09 PM BST\n\n999 calls surge amid global IT failure\n\nThe London Ambulance Service (LAS) has experienced \u201chuge increases\u201d in the number of calls to its 999 and 111 services following global IT issues.\n\nLAS chief executive Daniel Elkeles said:\n\nFollowing the global IT outage that has impacted some NHS services across the capital, our call handlers and ambulance crews are incredibly busy with huge increases in the number of calls to both our 999 and 111 services.\n\nIn fact, by 2pm today, we had received more than 3,000 999 calls and 3,000 calls to our 111 services - this is a third higher than we would usually receive in a full 24 hour period.\n\nOur teams are always here to help if you need us and we encourage anyone who needs our services to continue to contact us.\n\nWe are working very hard to make sure we are getting to patients as quickly as possible, but please be aware that our response times today may be impacted by this global issue.\n\nWe ask that people use our 999 services wisely and contact their pharmacy or visit NHS 111 online where possible. Londoners can continue to help us by only calling 999 in a serious medical emergency.\n\n04:06 PM BST\n\nPorts suffer delays from IT outage\n\nBritain\u2019s major ports revealed they have suffered delays to haulage and rail shipments as a result of the IT glitch.\n\nThe Port of Felixstowe\u00a0posted a message on its website to say it was hit by the \u201cglobal IT Crowdstrike issue\u201d at 5.40am.\n\nIt said haulage and rail operations have recommenced, and \u201cwe are working up to full capacity as soon as possible\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Peel Ports, which runs a number of docks around the country, told The Loadstar that the Port of Liverpool\u2019s connectivity to the a key industry messaging system \u201cwas temporarily interrupted for a couple of hours early this morning, but this was fully restored by 9.45am\u201d.

It is not easy to know what the future holds. You can\u2019t plan fully for every possible risk. But we must do what we can to learn the lessons of this period.\n\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s first responsibility is to keep the public safe. That\u2019s a top priority for this Government with a long-term approach to strengthening our national resilience. I will lead a review of our national resilience against the range of risks that the UK faces. I\u2019ll chair a dedicated Cabinet Committee on resilience to oversee that work.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, it\u2019s not just about central Government. We will work with the devolved governments, our regional mayors and local leaders as we consider the recommendations in this report. Because when we have an emergency, we should do everything we can to work together locally and nationally.\u201d\n\n10:39 AM BST\n\nFTSE 100 slumps amid IT chaos\n\nLondon markets dropped in value after the IT failure, which has caused issues around the world for banks, supermarkets, airlines and other major institutions.\n\nThe FTSE 100 fell 0.8pc in early trading as investors were spooked by the outage potentially hitting companies\u2019 bottom lines if it goes on too long.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange said securities trading was unaffected by the outage, but its regulatory news service was not working.\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said:\n\nCountless industries, from airlines and trains to banks and media, face disruption to earnings if they cannot do their job.\n\nWorkers cannot get from A to B and that will have a knock-on effect for industries across the board if staff aren\u2019t there to perform important functions or systems are offline.\n\nThe severity of the problem boils down to how long it lasts. A few hours\u2019 disruption is unhelpful but not a catastrophe. Prolonged disruption is another matter, potentially causing damage to companies and economies.\n\nStock markets continued to function as normal despite corporate news feeds and information terminals being impacted by the tech outage.\n\nFutures prices imply a small pullback when Wall Street opens later today, but so far investors have not shown any panic.

Whitecross Hereford High School, a specialist sports college, said its school information management system was down due to the tech outage and that parents should call in if their child is sick.\n\nHarlington Upper School in Bedfordshire reported similar, and said it was \u201cunable to contact parents if your child is not in school\u201d.\n\nThe disruption has also spread to universities.

Deferring all others that can safely wait to another day.\n\nDr Jameel also stressed how \u201cunsafe\u201d the interruption is. She added: \u201cI think we need to underline the clinical impact of this IT disruption on how significantly it has interrupted clinical care.

Some airlines are having to check in passengers manually, and that takes time. And aviation is a global network so that disruption elsewhere will have a knock-on effect here.\u201d\n\nVirgin Atlantic, one of the biggest carriers at the London hub, said its flying programme has not been affected.\n\nManchester airport said disruption is confined to those airlines -- chiefly Ryanair and TUI -- whose passenger handling is performed by Swissair, which is being forced to check in and board travellers manually.

Falcon is what is known as an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platform, which monitors the computers that it is installed on to detect intrusions - hacks - and respond to them.\n\nThat means that Falcon is a pretty privileged piece of software in that it is able to influence how the computers it is installed on behave.\n\nFor example, if it detects that a computer is infected with malware that is causing the computer to communicate with an attacker, then Falcon could conceivably block that communication from occurring. If Falcon is suffering a malfunction then it could be causing a widespread outage for two reasons - one: Falcon is widely deployed on many computers, and two: because of Falcon\u2019s privileged nature.\n\nFalcon is a bit like anti-virus software: it is regularly updated with information about the latest online threats (so it can better detect them). We have certainly seen anti-virus updates in the past causing problems. It is possible that today\u2019s outage may have been caused by a buggy update to Falcon.\n\n09:32 AM BST\n\nLuton Airport running manual systems amid outage\n\nLuton Airport said the global IT outage is affecting some airlines and operations are continuing with manual systems.\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, the airport posted:\n\nWe are aware of an ongoing global IT issue that is impacting check-in and boarding procedures for some airlines.\n\nWe have additional staff on hand to support and operations are continuing with manual systems.\n\nPassengers are advised to check with their airlines for flight updates.\n\n09:26 AM BST\n\nAir passengers left stranded amid travel chaos\n\nThe pictures of unhappy travellers are coming in thick and fast now as airlines grapple with increasing delays: Passengers are facing long queues at Gatwick after the IT outage - @sergepoliakoff Passengers waiting at Barajas Airport in Madrid - REUTERS/Elena Rodriguez Travelers at Los Angeles International Airport have been forced to sleep in a jetway for a delayed United Airlines flight hit by the IT outage - AP Photo/Stefanie Dazio\n\n09:21 AM BST\n\nPassengers given hand-written boarding passes\n\nAir passengers in India are being given hand-written boarding passes as airlines grapple with the IT outage.\n\nHere is a shot of a ticket from low-cost airline IndiGo: Air passengers in India are being given hand-written boarding passes as airlines grapple with the IT outage - @akothari\n\n09:19 AM BST\n\nMicrosoft 365 taking \u2018mitigation actions\u2019\n\nMicrosoft 365 say they are investigating an issue impacting users\u2019 ability to access apps and services.\n\n\u201cOur services are still seeing continuous improvements while we continue to take mitigation actions,\u201d they said on X this morning.\n\n\u201cWe still expect that users will continue to see gradual relief as we continue to mitigate the issue.\u201d\n\nIt comes amid reports of widespread IT outages affecting airlines, broadcasters and banks.\n\n09:15 AM BST\n\nGP appointment booking systems down\n\nGP appointment booking systems are down following the global tech outage, the NHS has confirmed.\n\nOur health editor Laura Donnelly has the latest:\n\nHealth officials said family doctors are struggling to access systems, with some practices saying they are unable to book appointments.\n\nThe main IT system used by primary care is understood to have been hit by the problems, which have seen airports, banks and television channels knocked offline.\n\nGP surgeries hit by the outage have said the issue \u201cwill have a big effect\u201d.\n\n09:12 AM BST\n\n999 unaffected by outage\n\nPeople are still able to phone 999 in an emergency, despite the IT outage disrupting GP services.\n\nAn NHS spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019re not currently aware of 999 services being affected.\u201d\n\nA Metropolitan Police spokesman said: \u201cNo issues that we\u2019re aware of for the Met.\u201d\n\n09:10 AM BST\n\nGatwick warns passengers \u2018may experience some delays\u2019\n\nLondon Gatwick airport has said \u201cpassengers may experience some delays\u201d due to the global outage.\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, the airport posted:\n\nWe are affected by the global Microsoft issues, so passengers may experience some delays while checking in and passing through security.\n\nPassengers should still arrive for their normal check-in time.\n\nWe apologise for any inconvenience and are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

        "title": "Experts Are Calling It the Largest IT Outage in History: What's Next for CrowdStrike Stock Now?",
        "content": "While many Americans were sleeping last night, information-technology (IT) systems were going down all around the world, including the IT systems for major airlines and banks. Experts are reportedly calling it the \"largest IT outage in history.\" And stock market darling CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) is right at the center of the crisis.\n\nCrowdStrike operates a cloud-based cybersecurity software platform. Being cloud-based, an update can come out at any time. The latest update had a \"defect\". And this defect caused Microsoft Windows operating systems to get stuck on a \"blue screen of death,\" unable to function properly.\n\nCo-founder and CEO George Kurtz says that CrowdStrike already identified the problem and deployed a fix. The recovery is consequently underway. For example, United Airlines says that it's already resuming flights.\n\nCrowdStrike is one of the most popular stocks on the market. Earlier this month, shares were up more than 50% in 2024. But as of 10:20 a.m. on Friday morning, shares were down 9%. Investors rightly want to know what to expect next. And there's truly a lot to unpack here.\n\nIs this an overreaction?\n\nInvestors often overreact to news in the short term, losing long-term perspective. However, with CrowdStrike and its peers, a short-lived problem can have long-term consequences. Companies selling physical products usually aren't materially changed overnight. But things can quickly break down for a cloud-based software business such as this.\n\nIn the risk section of its financial filings, CrowdStrike says, \"Because our cloud native security platform is complex, it may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after deployment.\" This is exactly what happened last night.\n\nCrowdStrike's management says that if a defect goes out it, \"Could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\" That's a hugely consequential statement.\n\nThe good news for CrowdStrike's investors is that this wasn't a cybersecurity-related problem. Kurtz quickly pointed this out by saying, \"This is not a security incident or cyberattack.\" The bad news is that its software defect still shut down major sectors of the global economy for long enough to cause real problems.\n\nWhat's next for CrowdStrike stock now?\n\nShareholders may be tempted to breathe a sigh of relief now that things are getting back up and running. And on one hand, it's encouraging how quickly CrowdStrike was able to implement a fix. But it's too soon to leave today's news in the rearview mirror.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor starters, airline travel was greatly impacted this morning and it will take time for the airlines to get everyone to where they need to go. Thousands of travelers had to change their plans and the cost to the airlines is real and substantial. There's zero chance these companies will willingly foot the bill. They'll be looking for CrowdStrike to make restitution.\n\nIt will take time to know how much this mistake could wind up costing CrowdStrike. Moreover, it will likely take even longer to understand the potential reputational damage. Yes, this is a massive cybersecurity company with nearly $3.3 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. But it's hardly the only show in town. And smaller competitors such as SentinelOne would love to capitalize on CrowdStrike's mistake.\n\nCrowdStrike's potential reputational damage will be a hard thing for investors to objectively evaluate from here. But one potential approach could be to monitor the company's remaining performance obligations (RPO). Its RPO stood at $4.7 billion as of April 30.\n\nCrowdStrike's RPO represents future revenue under contract related to its customers' subscriptions. The company points out that customers normally can't cancel once they sign on the dotted line. However, they can cancel if they have cause. And it's possible that many of its customers could say they have just cause to cancel after today's incident.\n\nIf the growth rate for CrowdStrike's RPO slows or if it outright drops, that might signal that there's damage that could set the business back, at least for a time.\n\nEven after dropping 9% this morning, CrowdStrike stock still trades at an expensive valuation of about 24 times its trailing sales. This lofty valuation assumes many years of robust growth ahead -- growth it's delivered on up until now. But if this event results in slowing growth for the company, then I would fully expect the stock to drop more and bring down the valuation to more appropriate levels.\n\nOn the flip side, if CrowdStrike maintains its current growth trajectory despite today's incident, that would suggest this business is even stronger than investors give it credit for. And if it improves its systems and processes to prevent a mistake of this caliber from ever happening again, it might wind up being in an even stronger competitive position for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why CrowdStrike Stock Is Crashing Today",
        "content": "CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) stock is plummeting in Friday's trading. The cybersecurity specialist's share price was down 8.5% as of 11 a.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Shares had been down as much as 15.4% earlier in the daily session.\n\nWith a new update that it rolled out, CrowdStrike inadvertently triggered system locks for hardware using Microsoft's Windows operating system. The issue has caused massive global outages for information technology systems, and investors are dumping the company's stock in response.\n\nCrowdStrike accidentally triggered a massive global IT outage\n\nCrowdStrike is a leading provider of cloud-based endpoint protection services for businesses and institutions. The company's platform helps prevent computers, mobile devices, servers, and other hardware from being used by cybercriminals to attack networks and is widely used. Unfortunately, the latest update for its deeply integrated cybersecurity software has caused widespread outages for Windows-based computer systems.\n\nWhile CrowdStrike is far from the first cybersecurity company to suffer a big setback, the recent outage is notable in its scale. The issue has impacted hundreds of millions of computers around the world and made it impossible for many hospitals, airlines, stores, and other businesses to operate normally.\n\nWhat comes next for CrowdStrike stock?\n\nWith today's big pullback, CrowdStrike stock is now down roughly 20% from its high. On the other hand, the stock is still up roughly 20% year to date and 101% over the last year.\n\nPrior to the outage, CrowdStrike had been on a massive winning streak. The company's AI-powered cybersecurity platform had been attracting new customers and increased spending from existing clients at an impressive pace. With its last quarterly report, the company delivered a 33% sales increase and a 63% jump for non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share.\n\nThe widespread service crash and related issues could make it more difficult for CrowdStrike to attract new customers and build relationships with those that are already using its services. It's also possible that the outage could expose the company to some legal liability. But the company's services have otherwise been held in high regard, and the entrenched nature of its platform and high switching costs could help minimize competitive pressures.\n\nFor long-term investors, the recent pullback on the stock could actually present a worthwhile buying opportunity. CrowdStrike's near-term brand management and financial performance will likely be viewed through a lens heavily shaped by the massive outage, but there's a good chance that the company will be able to weather these challenges.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget The Magnificent 7! The Next Generation of Tech Titans You Need to Own.",
        "content": "The Magnificent 7 stocks have driven stock market earnings over the last three quarters. That strong performance justifies the returns investors have received from those equities. At the same time, investors wonder whether it makes sense to continue to rely on such a narrow grouping of stocks to fuel returns. There\u2019s reason to believe that the next generation of tech titan stocks will soon emerge.\n\nEarnings growth within the Magnificent 7 is expected to slow in the second quarter. As earnings releases roll out, that is certain to cause the markets to reevaluate and likely diversify. That poses an interesting question for investors who want to capitalize on continued growth in the tech sector.\n\nIt also suggests that investors may want to forget the Magnificent 7 for the time being and consider the next generation of tech titans. Investors who agree with that theory should consider investing in the following tech stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWolfspeed (WOLF) WOLF stock: Person holding smartphone with logo of US semiconductor company Wolfspeed Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nWolfspeed (NYSE:WOLF) is a really interesting chip stock that not a lot of investors are aware of.\n\nThe chipmaker is focused on silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride technologies. That makes Wolfspeed something of a focused play within the semiconductor sector. Most investors know that semiconductors are the building blocks of modern technology. But there is much more to the technology, and it will pay for investors to dig deeper.\u00a0Those who do will find that power electronics are an area of the chip opportunity that many believe will experience rapid growth.\n\nThat\u2019s where Wolfspeed comes in with its expertise and focus on SiC technology. Silicon carbide chips combine silicon and carbon, resulting in superior performance over traditional silicon chips. It\u2019s an emerging area of the semiconductor industry with particular applicability in the automotive sector. EVs require far more chips than traditional cars, and Wolfspeed is positioned to capitalize on that emergence. That\u2019s evident in projections suggesting the company should improve dramatically in 2025 and beyond.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlmost every investor is aware that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\u00a0has emerged as a leading AI stock. the same investors are well aware that AMD continues to play second fiddle to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). But beyond its challenger status many of those investors know little else about the company and what makes it such an interesting future tech titan.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the most important factors is that AMD is a major name in high-performance computing. What that really means is AMD provides powerful processors used in servers and data centers. It is one of few companies with the real ability to serve the demand for artificial intelligence chips.\n\nFurthermore, AMD excels in producing both central processing units (CPUs) and graphical processing units (GPUs). Modern AI chips often leverage features and technological concepts from CPU and GPU. Tensor cores are an excellent example. They are AI chips designed to perform tensor operations used extensively for the purpose of deep learning.\n\nWhether AMD can truly challenge Nvidia remains to be seen but there are strong reasons to believe it will.\n\nDayforce (DAY) A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDayforce (NYSE:DAY) is a software stock that investors should really consider. It hits on a lot of upcoming trends and benefits from the strengths unique to the software sector.\n\nOne of the most important trends is that enterprises are seeking to improve HR efficiency. Dayforce has emerged as one of the better HR software companies and its stock has the potential to continue rising as the trend grows. More generally, the software market is expected to continue growing due to the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions. Add in other broad factors like increasing digitization and AI and it\u2019s easy to see why Dayforce will continue to have opportunities to grow.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of software stocks is recurring revenues. Generally speaking, once a piece of software is sold, recurring revenues tend to continue. The truth was on exhibit in the company\u2019s most recent earnings report which showed recurring revenue growth outstripping overall revenue growth.\n\nThe other glaring positive for Dayforce is the fact that earnings are really expected to grow in 2024. The company reached net profitability in 2023 and is expected to see earnings more than quadruple in 2024.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has already begun to take off in 2024, appreciating by 35% thus far. The company\u2019s opportunity will likely continue to grow, sending shares higher again.\n\nQualcomm is one of the leading phone chip manufacturers. That is a big part of the narrative behind its strong performance in 2024. It also explains why 2023 was so difficult for the firm. The smartphone market experienced a rapid decline in 2023. Qualcomm is a major supplier to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The slowdown in iPhone sales exemplifies Qualcomm\u2019s troubles in 2023.\n\nThis year is much different. The company\u2019s Snapdragon chips are particularly adept at running AI applications. That provides Qualcomm with a strong runway as Apple introduces its generative AI offerings to the world.\n\nQualcomm isn\u2019t so much the next generation of stocks beyond the Magnificent 7 as it is an extension of that current opportunity. It continues to be a solid choice for tech investors seeking price appreciation and income generation through dividends.\n\nNXP Semiconductors (NXPI) A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nNXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) is really a stock to consider for forward-looking contrarians who fully expect the automotive chip market to rebound.\n\nDuring the most recent quarter, NXP Semiconductors derived nearly 58% of its revenues from the automotive sector. Top Line results were flat on a year-over-year basis and declined sequentially. However, if the depths of the EV decline have been reached, NXPI shares are certainly worth buying at the moment.\n\nInvestors should not expect the blistering pace of growth experienced in the past few years to return soon. Instead, steady linear growth over the next several years is the more likely base case.\n\nFurthermore, shareholders should continue to be rewarded in 2024 as NXP Semiconductors grows its EPS. Top line results have basically stagnated since 2022 but this year earnings are expected to increase by more than 40%. Chip sales growth should return in 2025 as a variety of factors contribute to a rebound in the EV sector. It all suggests that NXPI shares should continue to reward investors for the near and mid-term.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is particularly focused on generative AI, a powerful type of AI that can create entirely new content based on user input. The company has multiple products to help users leverage generative AI to help with tasks like marketing and content creation. Adobe\u2019s prowess in the generative AI realm is a strong reason to believe it is a stock to own.\n\nAdobe\u2019s primary generative AI tools are Sensei and Firefly. Firefly is a tool for generating novel creative assets whereas Sensei is more geared toward task automation, suggestions and the enhancement of existing workflows.\n\nThe reason to believe in Adobe relates to the generative AI space development. Generative AI refers to the creation of text-based assets and visual assets including photos and video. Adobe is one of the strongest visual content creation platforms available. The application of AI to Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator provides so much opportunity for the company.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe future looks bright for CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock. The cybersecurity market itself is expected to balloon to $299 billion by 2028, and CrowdStrike is well-positioned to capture a significant share.\n\nThe company has managed to carve out a niche as a leader in cloud-native cybersecurity. The firm offers a platform for delivering endpoint protection, threat intelligence and incident response, powered by AI.\n\nCrowdStrike boasts impressive growth and surpassed $3 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in 2024. That rapid growth of 34% in 2023 has established CrowdStrike as one of the go-to cybersecurity stocks. As AI and cloud growth continue, so will the opportunity for the company to further cement its positional leadership.\n\nAs impressive as CrowdStrike\u2019s growth in 2023 was, 2024 and beyond are expected to be even more so. Annual growth through 2028 is expected to maintain a pace between 25% and 35%. Earnings are exploding this year. It\u2019s a recipe for a continued surge upward into the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "microsoft\n\nA massive IT outage has knocked out Windows computers around the world, taking airports, television and trains offline as engineers scramble to reboot their systems.\n\nThe problem began early on Friday morning UK time as workers found their PCs suddenly crashing, showing the so-called \u201cblue screen of death\u201d and entering recovery mode.\n\nWhile companies across the globe struggle to get online, here is what we know so far about the problem.\n\nWhat has happened?\n\nHundreds of thousands of computers around the world have suddenly shut down, impacting businesses, transport links and TV broadcasts globally.\n\nA software problem with a piece of cyber security technology, called Crowdstrike, appears to be to blame. The specific piece of technology, Crowdstrike Falcon Sensor, is used to protect against hacking threats, but engineers were quick to blame a problem with the system for causing the massive outage.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe issue mostly seems to be impacting PCs running on Windows 10 software.\n\nWho has been impacted?\n\nAn awful lot of people. While we still do not know the full impact of the bug, but so far this morning we have seen TV stations, transport links and banks complaining of problems.\n\nSky News was forced to pull its morning breakfast show and replace it with pre-recorded footage. Ryanair has warned on its website to expect major delays at airports around the world.\n\nImages on social media showed computers across airports and transport hubs showing the notorious \u201cblue screen of death\u201d. Users also reported being stuck on aeroplanes on the runway.\n\nThe Gatwick Express warned commuters to expect short-notice cancellations across the train network.\n\nIs it a cyber attack?\n\nSo far, all indications point to a software problem with Crowdstrike, but we know little about its root cause.\n\nThe technology is designed to protect computers against cyber incidents. As of 8am this morning, Crowdstrike had issued no public update on the origin of the problem.\n\nHowever, on a Reddit forum used by Crowdstrike engineers and cyber experts, users pointed to an update to customers which said: \u201cCrowdStrike is aware of reports of crashes on Windows hosts related to the Falcon Sensor. Symptoms include hosts experiencing a bugcheck\\blue screen error related to the Falcon Sensor.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat is Crowdstrike?\n\nCrowdstrike is one of the world\u2019s largest cyber security technology companies \u2013 valued at over $80bn (\u00a362bn) \u2013 whose tools are used by businesses around the planet.\n\nIts typical technology is known as endpoint detection and response \u2013 a type of antivirus \u2013 used to deal with hacking threats.\n\nThese products are updated regularly to deal with potential new cyber treats and often automatically add new tools to your PC.\n\nTroy Hunt, a cyber security expert, added in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Crowdstrike\u2019s tools often have \u201cprivileged\u201d access on PCs, meaning they have broad control over the machines to try and remove threats.\n\nHowever, he added that \u201calso means that if something goes wrong with an update, it\u2019s able to catastrophically nuke your machine\u201d.",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Netflix will be in the spotlight Friday, after the streaming giant beat expectations of net subscriber additions but issued a cautious revenue guidance. Donald Trump accepted the Republican Party presidential nomination, while Wall Street looks set to end the week lower with a sectorial rotation under way.\n\n1. Netflix net adds ahead, revenue guidance cautious\n\nNetflix\u2019s third-quarter revenue guidance fell short of expectations, even as the streaming giant reported better-than-expected second-quarter results amid blowout subscriber additions, driven by a strong content slate and an ongoing crackdown on password sharing.\n\nThe mixed nature of these results, released after the market close Thursday, has resulted in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock trading largely unchanged premarket Friday. The stock has surged nearly a third so far this year.\n\nNetflix reported second-quarter earnings of $4.88 a share on revenue of $9.56 billion, topping estimates of $4.74 on revenue of $9.53 billion.\n\nThe streaming giant also raked in 8 million additional users in the quarter, well above the 4.8 million estimated, but below the 9.3 million seen in the previous three months.\n\nThe company had guided for lower net subscriber additions in the second quarter as it is facing saturation in the United States and plans to stop regularly reporting new subscriber additions next year.\n\nOn the flip side, the company guided for third-quarter revenue of $9.37 billion, missing estimates of $9.81 billion, and said its advertising business would not become a primary driver of revenue growth until at least 2026.\n\nInvestors have been looking at the company's relatively new advertising business as a potential source of growth.\n\n2. Futures slip amid a weekly rotation\n\nU.S. stock futures slipped lower Friday, continuing the previous session\u2019s weakness as the quarterly earnings season marches on.\n\nBy 04:15 ET (08:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 75 points, or 0.2%, lower, S&P 500 futures dropped 9 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 60 points, or 0.3%.\n\nAll three major indices fell on Thursday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping more than 500 points, ending a six-day winning run.\n\nLooking at the week as a whole, a market rotation appears to be taking place, with the tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite down almost 3% and the S&P 500 1.3% lower, while the DJIA is up 1.7%.\n\nThe earnings continue to flow Friday, with results due from the likes of American Express (NYSE:AXP), Travelers (NYSE:TRV) and Comerica (NYSE:CMA) before the opening bell.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors will also have comments from Fed policymakers John Williams and Raphael Bostic to digest for clues about the future path of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy.\n\n3. Trump accepts nomination as Biden doubts rise\n\nDonald Trump formally accepted his nomination as the Republican Party\u2019s presidential candidate at the Republican National Congress in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Thursday.\n\nHis nomination as the GOP candidate now sets him up for a potential rematch with President Joe Biden, who had beaten Trump in the 2020 elections.\n\nTrump was seen gaining a large boost in popularity after the assassination attempt last week.\n\nIn contrast, Biden was facing growing calls from the Democratic party members and donors to pull out of the presidential race after his weak performance in last month\u2019s debate with Trump.\n\nCritics of Biden have argued that his advanced age and tenuous health make him unfit to run for a second term.\n\nBiden is likely to drop his bid for reelection, TD analysts said in a note, adding that the Republican party had now realigned around Trump, and the Democrats could potentially lose the Senate.\n\n\u201cWhile the decision ultimately rests with Biden, we see him dropping his re-election bid as a question of when, not if,\u201d TD said.\n\n\u201cShould Trump win in a GOP sweep (House&Senate), we suspect he would read that as a MAGA mandate for his American First policies\u2026 we expect (a) potential 2nd Term to be all gas, no brake.\u201d\n\n4. Crowdstrike, Microsoft suffers major outages\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has suffered a major outage on Friday, affecting business all around the world, and tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has also experienced an outage, resulting in at least two low-cost U.S. airlines grounding flights.\n\nCrowdstrike said its outage resulted from an issue with the latest update, and the company is now in the process of rolling back that update globally.\n\n\u201cCrowdStrike is aware of reports of crashes on Windows hosts related to the Falcon Sensor,\u201d the company said in a recorded message.\n\nMicrosoft reported an outage in its Azure cloud computing platform late-Thursday, with a note on the company\u2019s website attributing the Azure outage to a \u201cconfiguration change in a portion of our Azure backend workloads, caused interruption between storage and compute resources which resulted in connectivity failures that affected downstream Microsoft 365 services dependent on these connections.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s service health status website showed its 365 service was also experiencing \u201cdegradation,\u201d and that users will be unable to access several Microsoft 365 apps and services.\n\n5. Crude heads for weekly loss\n\nCrude prices fell Friday, heading for a weekly loss as a strong dollar and concerns about Chinese economic weakness weighed on investor sentiment.\n\nBy 04:15 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) dropped 0.5% to $80.91 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $84.89 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks are set for minor losses this week, their second consecutive losing week, after the dollar strengthened for the second consecutive session, hitting demand for dollar-denominated oil from investors holding other currencies.\n\nConcerns over sluggish demand in China, the world\u2019s biggest oil importer, remained front and center, following softer-than-expected growth figures for the second quarter.\n\nThe readings came after data last week showed a decline in China\u2019s oil imports in June.\n\nLimiting the week\u2019s losses this week has been the U.S. government reporting a bigger-than-expected weekly decline in oil stockpiles, suggesting consistent demand during the summer driving season.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNetflix, Trump nomination, outages - what's moving markets\n\nEuropean stocks slip, global IT outage causes chaos\n\nNeutral rate cannot determine monetary policy in India, says cenbank chief",

        "content": "The technology sector offers growth that few other sectors can match. Some of that growth is rooted in utilitarian, real-world innovation. Conversely, other niches within the tech sector grow due to the promise inherent to undeveloped, future technology. The metaverse is an excellent recent example of the latter. However, it remains very risky, and I believe that investors should focus on real-world tech stocks instead.\n\nWhen I say real world, I mean firms currently selling utilitarian technology.\u00a0 That means the things we see and use regularly, not vague promises like those from the metaverse.\n\nFortunately, there are many options within the highly developed tech sector. The more real-world innovation these companies bring to market, the more valuable their stocks should become. Sure, investing in undeveloped future technology sometimes yields massive returns. That said, the utilitarian route is safer and still offers very strong returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has returned even though iPhone sales remain problematic. By now, investors know the reason: Apple is rolling out its AI, which will be heavily applied to iPhones. The application of AI there, too, has reignited interest in the stock, sending it substantially higher over the past few months.\n\nWhile Apple\u2019s shares are currently fully priced, I think investors will continue to invest regardless. In 2024, the markets will continue to look for news to substantiate optimism, justified or not.\n\nI believe the rollout of the application of generative AI is a justifiable reason to invest in Apple even now. Apple intends to ship 10% more iPhones in the second half of 2024. The company plans to ship 90 million iPhone 16 devices during the period. The application of AI features in those phones is anticipated to drive a 10% rise in sales above iPhone 15 devices. iPhone sales are the main driver of Apple\u2019s success.

Several reasons, both internal and external, lead investors to continue to hold that belief.\n\nInternally, investors must spend a few minutes reviewing the company\u2019s financial statements. Those who do will see a company that continues growing rapidly on the top line while approaching net profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company continues rapidly improving its operating losses, leading management to adjust its guidance upward.\n\nExternally, investors should note that the rideshare super app serves a Southeast Asia region that is growing rapidly. GDP in the region is expected to increase by 4.6% in 2024. The region is characterized by favorable demographics and massive opportunities due to shifting global supply chains. Those factors supercharge the potential of companies, including Grab Holdings.\n\nGrab Holdings is an excellent example of how real-world technology can be applied to create utilitarian innovation and tangible results.\n\nSTMicroelectronics (STM) STMicroelectronics building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nDepending upon where you look, STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) is expected to break out strongly or very strongly.\n\nThe consensus is that the European chip maker is expected to increase value by roughly 20%. However, others, including Morningstar, expect that STMicroelectronics has closer to\u00a050% upside.\n\nThe push for safer, greener, smarter vehicles leads to increased electronic content across the automotive sector. STMicroelectronics is a notable competitor in the automotive sector. The company has significant opportunities in the microcontroller and silicon carbide based power product spaces.\n\nSilicon carbide (SiC) has unique properties that are highly utilitarian in power products. SiC components can withstand voltages up to 10 times higher than traditional silicon components. They also conduct heat better than silicon components. The technical advantages go on and on, and if STMicroelectronics competes strongly in that arena, it will thrive.\n\nThe three most recent analyst actions related to STMicroelectronics include two upgrades and the reiteration of a buy rating.\n\nEHang Holdings (EH) Flying taxi or Car-drone-EHang 216 exhibited by Prestige Image Motor Cars at the 2023 Indonesia International Motor Show (IIMS) at JIExpo Kemayoran. EH stock\n\nSource: Toto Santiko Budi / Shutterstock.com\n\nEHang Holdings (NYSE:EH) is the world\u2019s most advanced flying car company.\u00a0 The Chinese company commercialized electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) technology far ahead of its U.S. competitors.\n\nEHang Holdings\u2019 U.S. competitors continue to work through regulatory hurdles and are expected to commercialize sometime in 2025. Meanwhile, EHang Holdings has been delivering vehicles for some time. The company delivered 27 eVTOLs\u00a0in late June\u00a0to Wenchang County Transportation Group in Zhejiang Province. The vehicles are being used in tourism, and EHang Holdings is seeing success.\n\nThe company delivered 26 eVTOLs during the first quarter, substantially more than the 11 vehicles delivered a year prior. EHang Holdings\u2019s more than year of vehicle delivery experience should give investors some idea of how it compares with U.S. flying car firms and stoke interest due to the real-world results the deliveries exemplify.\n\nRevenues are booming at the company, while net losses continue to narrow. I believe EHang Holdings\u2019s early lead over its U.S. competitors, combined with improving financials, poises the stock for a breakout.\n\nLam Research (LRCX) Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX Stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nLam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a highly utilitarian tech stock that is poised for a breakout.\n\nThe company produces semiconductor fabrication equipment to produce the integrated circuits necessary for artificial intelligence. So, it\u2019s a part of the AI opportunity. The company is also building facilities near its global customers\u2019 research hubs.\n\nWhile the company is preparing for the continued emergence of AI, its results are also attractive. Earnings increased by 11.4% in the first quarter on better-than-anticipated revenues. Sales have grown by more than 20% over the last three years, while earnings during the same period increased by more than 30%.\n\nThe company announced a\u00a0share buyback roughly two months ago, which is indicative of the company\u2019s commitment to shareholders.\n\nMany investors looking for AI equipment producers will initially land on ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) as the best choice. Lam Research is not to be overlooked in that regard.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a major player in cybersecurity. Its core offerings focus on protecting computer systems from cyberattacks, with a particular emphasis on security solutions designed for the cloud environment, which offer scalability and flexibility. The advent of AI has upped the stakes in the cyber security world, positioning Crowdstrike stock for a breakout.\n\nTo be fair, Crowdstrike has already broken out in 2024 increasing in price by more than 47%. Even so, share prices remain slightly below consensus target prices.\n\nJudging the tech sector is particularly difficult concerning AI. Software stocks,\u00a0including Crowdstrike, recently saw a spike in demand as the markets rotated out of chip stocks and into software. It currently appears that FOMO surrounding chip stocks is suddenly high again.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the two AI subsectors can rise together in the coming weeks. Regardless, Crowdstrike is undergoing substantial earnings growth in 2024. That alone is a strong reason to expect it to break out further.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) Slim Margins Are a Real and Continuing Problem for CSCO Stock\n\nSource: Anucha Cheechang / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock represents a combination of stability and broad tech exposure that is highly utilitarian. The company sells networking hardware and includes a dividend that yields 3.5%.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is shifting toward a greater percentage of software sales overall. Software sales are associated with repeat purchases, whereas hardware sales tend to be one-and-done. The result is a much more advantageous sales cycle. Beyond that, software sales are associated with greater margins than hardware sales.\n\nCisco Systems is positioned to capitalize on the LoRa and Lo RaWAN opportunities. That said, Cisco Systems stock is down by more than 7% in 2024. In my mind it\u2019s poised for a breakout due to all of the factors I just mentioned. EPS is expected to grow by more than 23% this year at the company.\n\nHowever, Cisco Systems also anticipates that the top line will contract by a few percentage points. I look at it this way: The company will continue to have the earnings to pay a healthy dividend based on EPS projections. So, buy Cisco Systems for that while also remaining optimistic as are many analysts who expect shares could rise as high as $76, well beyond their current price of $46.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Cybersecurity remains an important and growing area of technology. Cyber threats and attacks are only growing as the world becomes more wired and interconnected. The consulting firm McKinsey & Co. has pegged the market opportunity for cybersecurity technology and service providers at $2 trillion. As a result, cybersecurity stocks are on the rise.\n\nFor corporations, cybersecurity is becoming an increasingly important cost of doing business. One need only look at the chaos caused at UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest health insurer in the United States, after a cyberattack took down its technology unit Change Healthcare. The attack disrupted UnitedHealth\u2019s payment system and forced it to provide $9 billion worth of loans to some partners. The company is forecasting a hit to its earnings this year of $2.05 per share.\n\nHere are three cybersecurity stocks that could grow your wealth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is recovering after suffering a big dip in this year\u2019s first quarter. Year-to-date, PANW stock is up 15% and things look encouraging after the company\u2019s first-quarter financial results. Long-term Palo Alto Networks remains one of the best cybersecurity stocks to own, having risen nearly 350% over the last five years. After dropping due to a decline in quarterly billings, PANW stock has recovered after its Q1 profit and sales figures beat analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nPalo Alto Networks reported Q1 EPS of $1.32, which beat estimates of $1.25 per share. Revenue came in at $1.98 billion, which topped analyst expectations of $1.97 billion. The company\u2019s sales were up 15% from a year earlier. While corporate spending on cybersecurity has dipped over the past year due to inflation and an uncertain economic environment, Palo Alto Networks sees that changing as interest rates move lower in the coming months.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is having a very good year. Not only is CRWD stock up 45% since January, but it was added to the benchmark S&P 500 index on June 24, giving its share price a further boost as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the S&P 500 are required to buy it. Over five years, CrowdStrike stock has risen nearly 330%, making it another long-term winner.\n\nCrowdStrike stock popped 7% after the cybersecurity firm recently reported Q1 financial results that beat Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines. The company reported EPS of 93 cents, which was above the 89 cents expected among analysts who track the company\u2019s progress. Revenue amounted to $921 million, up 34% from a year earlier and ahead of Wall Street estimates of $905 million. Subscription revenue, an important metric for the company, grew 34% to $872.2 million in Q1.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOG/GOOGL) GOOG stock: letters spelling out google\n\nSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG/NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of search engine Google, is pushing aggressively into the cybersecurity space. Media reports say that Alphabet is circling cybersecurity firm Wiz in what could be a $23 billion acquisition, the biggest deal ever for the tech giant. Wiz provides cybersecurity for cloud-computing platforms and services.\n\nWhile purchasing Wiz would be Alphabet\u2019s biggest deal ever, it would not be Alphabet\u2019s first cybersecurity purchase. In 2022, Alphabet bought cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion. Alphabet executives have said that growing their cybersecurity offerings is a key focus of the technology giant. Alphabet recognizes the growing importance of cybersecurity, particularly for its Google Cloud unit and internet-connected smart home devices. GOOGL stock is up 30% year-to-date and has gained 220% over five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in GOOGL.

        "title": "This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Is Outperforming Nvidia. Can It Keep Doing So?",
        "content": "Share prices of CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) have taken off since the beginning of June, with impressive gains of 22% as of this writing. There are a couple of reasons behind the cybersecurity specialist's robust rally that helped it outpace one of the hottest stocks on the market during this period: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nIt's worth noting that CrowdStrike's gains over the past month are almost double the 11% jump that Nvidia stock has registered. Much of the jump can be attributed to the cybersecurity company delivering impressive fiscal 2025 first-quarter results (for the three months ended April 30) at the start of June. CrowdStrike beat Wall Street's expectations and raised its fiscal 2025 guidance.\n\nThe company's impressive results were followed by news that it would join the S&P 500 index, and that gave the stock another shot in the arm. These positive developments go a long way to explaining why CrowdStrike stock is up nearly 50% in 2024.\n\nShould investors consider buying this cybersecurity stock in anticipation of more upside? Let's find out.\n\nCrowdStrike's AI-powered growth is here to stay\n\nCrowdStrike's revenue in fiscal Q1 increased 33% year over year to $921 million. The revenue jump was driven by customers' increased spending on cybersecurity offerings. CrowdStrike reported that more than 65% of its subscription customers now use five or more of its cybersecurity modules. That was up from 62% a year ago.\n\nEven better, CrowdStrike reported a 95% year-over-year increase in clients using eight or more cybersecurity modules (thanks to the growing demand for its Falcon cybersecurity platform). CrowdStrike has been integrating AI tools and functionalities into the Falcon platform, such as a generative AI-powered security assistant known as Charlotte AI, to help companies shorten response times to cyber threats.\n\nGoing forward, CrowdStrike plans to push the envelope in the AI-enabled cybersecurity market by partnering with companies like Nvidia. The cybersecurity specialist will allow customers to use Nvidia's hardware to train custom cybersecurity large language models so that they can \"improve threat hunting, detect supply chain attacks, identify anomalies in user behavior, and proactively defend against emerging exploits and vulnerabilities.\"\n\nSuch moves could help CrowdStrike capture a bigger share of the AI-enabled cybersecurity market, which is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22% through 2031 and generate annual revenue of $114 billion at the end of the forecast period. The growing adoption of the company's AI-enabled cybersecurity platform will allow it to build a solid future revenue pipeline.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike's remaining performance obligations (RPO) increased 42% year over year in the previous quarter to $4.7 billion. The metric's growth outpaced the improvement in the company's revenue, which bodes well for the future as the RPO refers to the total value of a company's future contracts that are yet to be fulfilled.\n\nThe improving revenue pipeline also explains why CrowdStrike raised its fiscal 2025 revenue forecast to $3.99 billion at the midpoint from the earlier estimate of $3.95 billion. The updated forecast points toward a potential year-over-year jump of 31% in the company's revenue. But don't be surprised to see CrowdStrike ending the year with stronger growth on the back of its solid RPO.\n\nBut is the stock worth buying right now?\n\nCrowdStrike's better-than-expected results and improved full-year guidance have no doubt stoked investors' enthusiasm, but they have also made the stock quite expensive. CrowdStrike currently trades at 28 times sales, which is significantly higher than the U.S. technology sector's average of 8.3.\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Rob Owens points out that CrowdStrike stock has the highest sales multiple of any public software company with a market cap of more than $75 billion. Chip designer Nvidia, for comparison, has a price-to-sales ratio of 40, but it is growing at a much faster pace than CrowdStrike. Moreover, a closer look at the forward sales multiples indicates that Nvidia is expected to keep growing at a faster pace as its forward reading is much lower than the trailing sales multiple (its P/S is expected to fall from 40 down to 26 while CrowdStrike is expected to go from 28 down to 23). NVDA PS Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nGiven that Nvidia is the dominant player in the AI chip market and has a brighter growth outlook, investors would be tempted to put their money into the semiconductor giant instead of CrowdStrike. After all, CrowdStrike's valuation is the reason Piper Sandler downgraded the stock from overweight to neutral.\n\nAlso, CrowdStrike's 12-month median price target of $400 (as per 48 analysts covering the stock), points toward almost no upside from current levels. That's why investors who have missed this cybersecurity stock's impressive run-up in 2024 would do well to keep it on their watchlists and look for a better entry point before adding CrowdStrike to their portfolios.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Annual recurring revenue makes it easier for corporations to hit benchmarks and generate returns for long-term investors. Companies with this business model can boost revenue by attracting new customers, offering more subscription plans and raising product prices.\n\nSome stocks with annual recurring revenue have comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. It\u2019s very difficult to switch once customers get comfortable with a software product or another service. For most companies, switching isn\u2019t worth the effort, especially when competitors offer marginal improvements at best.\n\nWhile annual recurring revenue models offer great potential, they\u2019re even better if a corporation reports profits. Once an unprofitable company reports its first profitable quarter, net income can grow rapidly in subsequent quarters. That\u2019s already played out for some of the growth stocks on this list. Investors looking for companies with vibrant annual recurring revenue models may want to consider these picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) generates annual recurring revenue from its top-tier cybersecurity platform. Many businesses use Crowdstrike to keep their digital assets safe from hackers. A single cyberattack can cost a company millions of dollars between lost business and legal fees. Customers will also lose trust in a company that gets hacked, especially if breaches become common.\n\nThe cybersecurity stock has delivered a 50% year-to-date gain and has more than quintupled over the past five years. Annual recurring revenue growth is a big reason for this. The company closed out the first quarter of fiscal 2025 with $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue, a 33% year-over-year increase. Net income surged to $42.8 million, compared to $0.5 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nCrowdstrike only recently became profitable, but its profit margins are already soaring. Crowdstrike\u2019s net profit margins came close to 5% in the quarter. Shares have received more attention thanks to the company\u2019s recent inclusion in the S&P 500. A strong foundation of annual recurring revenue suggests that the gains can continue.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Stock market or forex trading graph and candlestick chart suitable for financial investment concept.

Stocks to buy\n\nSource: KingN / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) has increased by 45% over the past year as the search engine marketing tool continues to gain momentum. The $2 billion corporation recently reported profits and has wasted no time expanding its margins. Net income and net profit margins more than doubled year over year in the first quarter. Semrush also reported 21% year-over-year revenue growth. The company closed the quarter with $354.2 million in annual recurring revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has a top-tier product in the industry and attracts many customers. At the end of the quarter, Semrush had roughly 112,000 paying customers, a 10% year-over-year increase. Semrush\u2019s investments in generative AI have been paying off and should increase retention. The company\u2019s AI initiatives can also attract new paying customers.\n\nSemrush has a large pool of prospects who can become paying customers in the future. The search engine marketing tool has more than 1,125,000 registered free active customers, up 27% year over year. Semrush leadership cited new customers and a higher average revenue per customer as catalysts that drove the strong first quarter results.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nA key component of any annual recurring revenue business model is customer retention. If a company attracts customers but has a high churn rate, it won\u2019t maintain growth for long. That\u2019s why ServiceNow\u2019s (NYSE:NOW) 98% renewal rate stands out. The cloud platform helps businesses create workflows, boost productivity, and offer better customer experiences.\n\nServiceNow is only up by 9% year-to-date but has delivered an impressive 149% gain over the past five years. Wall Street analysts believe those gains can grow from current levels. The stock is rated as a Strong Buy with a projected 14% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $946 per share suggests a potential 26% gain.\n\nThe cloud platform exceeded guidance in Q1 2024 with 24% year-over-year revenue growth. Most of ServiceNow\u2019s revenue comes from subscriptions, which offers a solid foundation for future growth. Net income doubled year-over-year, resulting in a 13.3% net profit margin.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CRWD and NOW.

        "content": "Is the tech trade really over? Much is being written about investors rotating capital out of high-flying technology names and into value and small-cap stocks. While the rotation is seen as healthy and likely to prolong the current market rally that began in late 2022, it seems doubtful that technology stocks will trail for long.\n\nFirst of all, tech firms tend to be the engines of innovation and growth in the economy. That fact has only accelerated with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Second, the quarterly financial results of technology companies justify their stock\u2019s performance and lofty valuations. With the economy and consumer spending remaining resilient, there\u2019s no reason to assume that there will be an earnings downturn.\n\nLastly, technology companies, particularly the mega-cap variety, have a dominant position in the markets in which they compete. Some, it can be argued, have near-monopoly positions. That also looks unlikely to change or be seriously challenged in the near future. Here are seven longevity tech stocks extending investment horizons.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe good news keeps on coming for Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). The latest tailwind for the stock is that it\u2019s being added to the Nasdaq 100 index, replacing\r\npharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). SMCI stock will officially start trading on the Nasdaq 100 July 22. The Nasdaq 100 is comprised of the 100 largest non-financial companies in the broader Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 should give its stock a boost as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the index will now be required to buy its shares. Super Micro Computer makes servers that run AI microchips and processors and its products are in high demand worldwide. SMCI stock has more than tripled so far in 2024. Earlier this year, the company\u2019s stock was added to the benchmark S&P 500 index where it remains the top performing security.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) A chart of the MicroStrategy (MSTR) logo with a Bitcoin\n\nSource: JOCA_PH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of winning tech stocks, how about software firm turned Bitcoin (BTC-USD) powerhouse MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR)? The company\u2019s stock has performed nearly as well this year as Super Micro Computer. Since January, MSTR stock has gained 141%, driving its share price up to $1,654.18 and leading the company to announce a 10-for-1 stock split that goes into effect on August 8.\n\nWhile technically a provider of enterprise software, MicroStrategy has switched its focus in recent years and adopted an aggressive Bitcoin-buying strategy. Michael Saylor, the company\u2019s executive chairman, has said that MicroStrategy is now primarily focused on Bitcoin development and blockchain technologies. At the end of June this year, MicroStrategy owned 226,331 Bitcoin worth $14.59 billion based on the current price of the largest cryptocurrency.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at Wall Street firm Bernstein recently said that MicroStrategy is \u201cbuilding the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin company\u201d and that the stock has a further 80% upside.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nGoogle parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is well-known as a leader in AI. However, Alphabet is still a diversified technology company that has its tentacles in many other areas of technology, from smartphones to cybersecurity. The company\u2019s role in cybersecurity looks likely to expand with the expected acquisition of Wiz, a privately held firm that specializes in cybersecurity for cloud computing.\n\nMultiple media reports say Alphabet is planning to spend $23 billion to purchase Wiz, in what would be its biggest acquisition ever. Wiz was founded in 2020 and had been planning an initial public offering (IPO) later this year. However, it now looks as though Wiz will be content to sell itself to Alphabet instead. The purchase comes as Alphabet makes growing its cybersecurity offerings a key priority.\n\nIn 2022, Alphabet acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion. Alphabet\u2019s stock has risen 33% so far this year and the consensus rating among 38 analysts who cover the company is that the shares are a \u201cstrong buy.\u201d\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of \u201cstrong buy\u201d ratings, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) also holds one, along with a median price target that is 17% above where the stock currently trades. Investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently named Dell a \u201ctop pick\u201d and said the company\u2019s share price could rise as much as 40% over the next 12 months. At the start of July, Dell stock was added to Bank of America\u2019s (NYSE:BAC) coveted \u201cU.S. 1 List\u201d of top investment ideas.\n\nThe bullish sentiment is due to the opportunity Dell has in front of it with AI, notably the servers that run AI applications and models. That business is expected to accelerate and become more profitable in coming quarters. At the same time, Dell\u2019s core personal computer (PC) business is expected to outperform in coming quarters as a global refresh leads to accelerating PC sales this year and throughout 2025.\n\nDELL stock has increased 80% so far this year, with more gains likely, according to analysts.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo on an Apple store in Santa Monica, California.\n\nSource: View Apart / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs far as bullish sentiment goes, few stocks have experienced as big a turnaround in recent weeks as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). At the start of the year, Apple couldn\u2019t do anything right. The media was awash with headlines about slumping iPhone sales, rising competition in China, and a new augmented reality headset that, at more than $3,000, was too expensive for most consumers. But ever since Apple unveiled its AI strategy in June, its been blue skies for the company\u2019s stock.\n\nAAPL stock has risen 40% from a 52-week low reached in April. The shares are now up 25% on the year and trading near an all-time high on a split adjusted basis. The rebound comes after Apple announced plans to add advanced AI technology to future versions of the iPhone. Analysts say the addition of AI should spur global sales of the smartphone in coming years.\n\nAdditionally, Apple has just expanded sales of its Vision Pro augmented reality headset, rolling it out in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and U.K. Suddenly, Apple stock looks unstoppable once again.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nAs mentioned with Alphabet, cybersecurity remains a hot corner of technology right now. And among cybersecurity stocks, CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is the king. Over the past 12 months, CRWD stock has increased 143%, including a 50% gain so far this year. Analysts and investors stood up and cheered after the company\u2019s last financial results, which beat Wall Street estimates across the board.\n\nCrowdStrike reported EPS of 93 cents, which was above the 89 cents expected among analysts. Revenue for the year\u2019s first three months totaled $921 million, up 34% from a year earlier and ahead of estimates calling for $905 million in sales. CrowdStrike\u2019s free cash flow stood at $322.5 million at quarter\u2019s end, up 42% from a year ago. If there\u2019s a knock on CRWD stock it is the valuation.\n\nShares currently trade at nearly 700x future earnings estimates. While pricey, many analysts continue to see CrowdStrike as the de facto leader among cybersecurity stocks.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nWe\u2019ll end with a dark horse candidate: design software company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). The company behind products such as Photoshop, Illustrator and the PDF has seen its share price driven 3% lower this year over concerns that AI is going to effectively put it out of business. However, reports of Adobe\u2019s demise appear to have been greatly exaggerated based on the company\u2019s most recent quarterly print.\n\nADBE stock rose 17% after the company reported financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts and raised its full-year guidance. Adobe announced Q1 EPS of $4.48 compared to $4.39 that was expected among analysts. Revenue came in at $5.31 billion versus $5.29 billion that had been estimated. Sales rose 10% from a year earlier. Rather than be replaced by AI, management said on an earnings call that they are using the technology to their advantage.\n\nSpecifically, Adobe is adding AI across its suite of creative products, including Firefly and Illustrator, and charging a premium for it.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in GOOGL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "title": "7 Stocks That Can Still Double Your Money by 2026",
        "content": "The stock market makes it easier to achieve long-term financial goals. While any asset can get you closer to your milestones, few opportunities offer the same liquidity and choices as stocks. You can start buying stocks with as little as a dollar and build your portfolio with every paycheck.\n\nNaturally, some stocks do better than others, and it\u2019s possible to double your money within a few years if you pick the right stocks. Investors should look for companies with rising revenue and profit margins. Growth in those metrics can elevate the stock price and give investors more reasons to stick around. A company\u2019s industry, long-term catalysts and valuation also help investors to paint a better picture about a stock\u2019s potential.\n\nThe following seven growth stocks show plenty of potential to possibly double your money by 2026. These are the stocks to monitor in the second half of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is an educational app that helps people learn new languages through guided verbal and written lessons. The app has also expanded to cover additional subjects like music and math. Although Duolingo stock is down by 10% year-to-date (YTD), it looks like a good candidate to double your money in a few years. That\u2019s because financial growth is booming, and users continue to flock to the platform.\n\nRevenue increased by 45% year-over-year (YOY) in the first quarter. That\u2019s always been a bright spot for the company, but profits are also expanding at a quick rate. Net income came to $27.0 million this quarter compared to a net loss of $2.6 million in the same quarter last year. Rising profits will support a lower P/E ratio which can make the stock more attractive for long-term investors. And, Wall Street analysts are on board with Duolingo\u2019s catalysts. The stock is rated as a moderate buy with a projected 3% upside.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) continues to soar as profit margins improve. The stock has more than doubled over the past five years, but it\u2019s still possible for the stock to double again within a few years. Meta Platforms only trades at a 28 P/E ratio while delivering exceptional financials.\n\nRevenue increased by 27% YOY in the first quarter while net income soared by more than 117% YOY. These strong numbers won\u2019t stick around forever. So, if Meta Platforms continues to post impressive numbers for several quarters, it\u2019s possible for the stock to double quickly.\n\nStory continues\n\nMark Zuckerberg has emphasized the company\u2019s commitment to efficiency. Workforce has been downsized by 10% YOY to 69,329 employees. The company has grown across all metrics, including daily active users. More than 3.24 billion people use Meta Platforms\u2019 family of apps each day. That\u2019s a 7% YOYO increase for the company\u2019s social media platforms. Meta Platforms remains a leader in the social media industry and should continue to generate billions of dollars from ads every quarter.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leader in the cybersecurity industry that generates recurring revenue from its subscription model. Corporations and small businesses invest in Crowdstrike\u2019s software to protect themselves from digital attacks. Companies can lose millions of dollars from hacks due to legal costs, lost customer trust and other factors.\n\nAlthough other cybersecurity stocks have reported decelerating revenue growth, Crowdstrike continues to charge forward. Revenue increased by 33% YOY to reach $921.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Net income came to $42.8 million compared to $0.5 million in the same quarter last year. Also, CRWD\u2019s annual recurring revenue jumped by 33% YOY to reach $3.65 billion.\n\nCurrently, Crowdstrike is rated as a strong buy among 31 Wall Street analysts. The average price target suggests an 8% upside from current levels. However, some analysts are more bullish. The highest price target of $440 per share implies that shares can gain an additional 18% from current levels.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) Nubank mobile app on white cell phone and credit card on black surface. NU stock.\n\nSource: Lais Monteiro / Shutterstock\n\nNu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is another Wall Street favorite that has a 4% upside at the average price target and is rated as a strong buy. Analysts have several reasons to like the digital bank\u2019s prospects. First, the bank recently reached 100 million customers, and most of them are active. The stock also has momentum on its side, based on a 67% YTD gain.\n\nThe stock\u2019s momentum is justified based on first quarter results. During that quarter, revenue increased by 69% YOY. Net income jumped from $141.8 million in Q1 of 2023 to $378.8 million in this quarter. That\u2019s a 167% YOY improvement.\n\nNu Holdings offers customers access to several financial products. It offers loans, credit cards, bank accounts and brokerage accounts. The digital bank primarily serves customers in the growing Latin America region. Rising revenue and profit margins suggest that the stock can outperform the stock market and double in a few years. The Q1 of 2024 net profit margin came in at 29.7%.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is a cosmetics company that is a big hit among Gen Z consumers. The company uses cruelty-free ingredients in its products and offers various choices. The formula has worked well for investors, as shares are up by 37% YTD. Further, the stock is up by more than a whopping 1,000% over the past five years.\n\nShares have soared thanks to a series of superb earnings reports, including Q4 FY24 results. The company reported a 71% YOY increase in net sales during that quarter. That growth rate helped Elf Beauty exceed $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. Also, the company provided upbeat guidance for fiscal 2025 that suggests high growth rates will remain.\n\nTherefore, Elf Beauty should continue to gain market share based on guidance, and it shouldn\u2019t surprise long-term investors. The cosmetics firm gained market share for the 5th consecutive year and delivered its 21st consecutive quarter of net sales and market share growth.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nRobinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) shares have almost doubled YTD. It\u2019s a big turnaround for the company that still remains well removed from its all-time high and IPO price. The fintech firm offers a range of innovative financial products that helped it deliver 40% YOY revenue growth in the first quarter.\n\nTransaction-based revenue is the largest and fastest growing segment. This component of Robinhood\u2019s business grew by 59% YOY to reach $329 million. The significant growth rate is largely attributed to crypto revenue jumping by 232% YOY to reach $126 million. Although Robinhood has more going for its business than crypto, anyone who is bullish on the digital tokens may want to give Robinhood a closer look.\n\nNet income jumped from a net loss of $511 million to a net profit of $157 million YOY. Robinhood Gold subscriptions are also picking up and were a part of the company\u2019s \u201cOther revenues\u201d segment. This part of Robinhood\u2019s business increased by 35% YOY to reach $35 million in revenue.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Close up hand holding mobile with Digital Advertising and icons, Digital Marketing concept. digital ad stocks\n\nSource: weedezign via Shutterstock\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is on the upswing after a few flat years and an IPO gone bust. Shares are up by 9% YTD, and the search engine marketing tool\u2019s prospects are looking bright. While corporations, small businesses and solopreneurs have regularly used Semrush\u2019s products, it\u2019s becoming a more attractive investment.\n\nRevenue increased by 21% YOY in the first quarter to reach $85.8 million. Two key catalysts drove Semrush\u2019s top-line success. The first catalyst was a 10% YOY increase in the number of paying customers. Semrush has roughly 112,000 paying customers on its platform and an additional 1,125,000 registered free active customers. The latter figure is up by 27% YOY.\n\nAnother key component of Semrush\u2019s success is higher prices. SEMR can raise prices on its products and get existing customers to upgrade their accounts. That\u2019s the reason the number of Semrush customers who pay more than $10,000 annually grew by 32% YOY. Also, Semrush is profitable and delivered a $2.1 million net income in the quarter.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CRWD and ELF. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMarc Guberti is a finance freelance writer at InvestorPlace.com who hosts the Breakthrough Success Podcast.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD).\n\nCrowdStrike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.21, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 42 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.21 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 42 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.7% and 7.1% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CRWD Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRWD\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for CrowdStrike here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying CrowdStrike, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs CRWD Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for CrowdStrike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.7% over the past month to $3.99.\n\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for CrowdStrike. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for CrowdStrike with a grain of salt.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Stocks to Buy: 7 Founder-Led Companies Set to Outperform",
        "content": "What would you say if there was a reliable, evergreen indicator that a company will consistently out-innovate its competitors and, by extension, have a greater chance of long-term survival and market outperformance? While it may seem a pipe dream, research indicates that founder-led companies do just that, creating a unique set of parameters when looking for stocks to buy.\n\nA 2016 study found that \u201cthe innovations of founder CEO-managed firms create more financial value than the innovations of professional CEO-managed firms;\u201d in other words, when a company\u2019s founder is at the helm, the company is more likely to take the types of risk that companies must embrace if they\u2019re to maintain a competitive edge. Oftentimes, the managerial and professional CEO class is content to keep a company on the same trajectory, if not tweak operations solely for financial engineering purposes.\n\nJust look to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) for proof positive of how professional CEOs can tank a company\u2019s value proposition: Sundar Pichai made his bones with consulting firm McKinsey, whose alumni are notorious for a focus on bean counting over innovation (and even product safety), before moving up Google\u2019s corporate ladder to his current position. Today, Google is derided for slipping search efficacy \u2014 not to mention falling behind in the race toward artificial intelligence.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn contrast, these founder-led companies remain at the cutting edge of their respective industries. And, if history is any indication, these founder-led companies are also set to outperform most.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen you think of today\u2019s top founder-led companies, the first name that likely pops up is Elon Musk. SpaceX, Neuralink, and, of course, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are just a few companies Musk founded and still runs today. And, even with the recent robotaxi delay drama, Tesla has plenty of upside in the near future.\n\nMany point to Tesla\u2019s recent sales slump as evidence supporting their bear thesis \u2014 whether poor product quality, Musk\u2019s perceived inherent risk factors, or just plain antagonism toward the stock. However, looking at Tesla sales as a standalone measure is a misguided metric. Fewer than 20% of new car buyers pay cash, instead preferring financing. Today, new car loan interest rates are bumping up against 9%. Considering these macro factors, is it any wonder Tesla is selling fewer cars? As rates stabilize and fall, expect consumers waiting for improved financing terms to flock to Tesla.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Tesla is rapidly reducing production costs, which will expand the company\u2019s market share as it can target budget-minded buyers with lower-priced vehicles. Factor in artificial intelligence, robotics and a range of profitable peripheral endeavors and it\u2019s clear that Musk and Tesla fit the founder-led companies paradigm to a T.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock. Nvidia stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf Tesla wasn\u2019t enough to hammer home the strength in founder-led companies, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) should do the trick. Founded more than 30 years ago by Jensen Huang, Huang\u2019s long-term outlook, patience, and willingness to identify and innovate toward emerging tech trends \u2014 artificial intelligence in particular \u2014 benefited shareholders and customers alike.\n\nI don\u2019t need to rehash Nvidia\u2019s shocking performance over the past two years, nor the catalysts, but instead want to look at Huang\u2019s unique approach to management and steering the company forward. Huang emphasizes his humble beginnings often, pointing to time spent bussing tables as a teenager as a major contributor to today\u2019s work ethic and willingness to dive into the dirty details to make sure products and processes are on point.\n\nMoreover, Huang isn\u2019t content to rest on his laurels like so much of the professional-managerial CEO class \u2014 he\u2019s actively looking to \u201cfutureproof\u201d Nvidia in a bid to protect his current empire and help it adapt and evolve with the times. This commitment to excellence and, more importantly, a long-term view of things is rare in a market more focused on quarter-to-quarter outcomes than multi-year game plans. That\u2019s yet another reason to fall back on founder-led companies.\n\nFigs (FIGS) Person holding smartphone with logo of US healthcare apparel company Figs Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFigs (NYSE:FIGS) faced a particularly trying few years after peaking at nearly $50 per share following its 2021 IPO, only to drop to around $6 per share today. But the drastic per-share price dip conceals a major advantage that could reverse its fortune. Figs counts itself among founder-led companies, created in 2013 and jointly run by the founders Heather Hasson and Trina Spear today, but also facing near-inevitable market share dominance.\n\nFigs makes higher-end uniforms for healthcare professionals, essentially trying to do for scrubs what Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU). However, the company faced stiff competition from the nation\u2019s largest scrubs company, Careismatic Brands, which dominates as much as half of the overall market. But Careismatic fell on hard times and just emerged from bankruptcy proceedings last month. Successfully navigating bankruptcy comes with a price \u2014 which is already apparent after the company laid off staff and closed distribution centers in May.\n\nThis shakeup, of course, works to Figs\u2019 benefit: The company is primed to snatch up market share from Careismatic. One interview with Spear highlighted the unique approach to targeting its total addressable market (TAM) that typifies founder-led companies, as she said \u201clazy companies sell into TAM, and innovative companies create TAM.\u201d Careismatic\u2019s stumbles may end up creating the biggest TAM of all for Figs moving forward.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) The Regeneron (REGN) website is displayed on a smartphone screen over a blue background.\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nFew have as close a bead on the wider biotech market as scientists involved in the industry, making Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) unique among founder-led companies. Led today by co-founders George Yancopoulos and Leonard Schleifer, the CEO and president/chief science officer, respectively. Regeneron is also unique among biotech stocks in its relative stability in a volatile sector. In fact, its beta is just 0.13, which is shockingly low for any stock \u2014 let alone one in the biotech field.\n\nOne of Regeneron\u2019s recent successes is the August 2023 FDA approval for a high-dosage version of its eye disease treatment, Eylea. This approval strengthens Regeneron\u2019s competitive position and helps mitigate the impact of Medicare price negotiations on the company\u2019s revenue.\n\nRegeneron\u2019s future also looks promising due to its other therapeutics, especially Dupixent. Initially used to treat asthma and eczema, Dupixent is now in Phase 3 trials for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Early results are promising, showing a 34% reduction in symptoms. Given Dupixent\u2019s current success, analysts project that expanding its use to COPD could drive sales to $20 billion annually.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs with biotech, few understand cybersecurity\u2019s nuances as techies. Crowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is one of those high-end cybersecurity firms that also meets the parameters of founder-led companies, run today by co-founder George Kurtz.\n\nTo that end, businesses today face myriad challenges, from geopolitical conflicts and natural disasters to supply chain disruptions. However, regardless of size, cyber threats remain the top global risk for most business owners. Concerns about cyber attacks, data breaches, digital infrastructure vulnerabilities, and ransomware are paramount.\n\nCrowdstrike is uniquely positioned to tackle these escalating threats, even beyond its status among founder-led companies. As technological advancements demand more robust security measures, Crowdstrike\u2019s comprehensive solutions are lynchpins to company success, making switching costs too steep for most firms and further entrenching its market share positioning. The company already boasts a diverse clientele, including government agencies, corporations, small businesses, and educational institutions.\n\nCrowdstrike\u2019s impressive financial performance reinforces the founder-led company thesis. The company has seen significant revenue growth over the past five quarters, with the last four marking its first consecutive profitable periods. These steady income increases, especially in the current economic climate, indicate a promising future for Crowdstrike as it continues to dominate the digital security landscape.\n\nOn Holding (ONON) A photograph of a person running along the side of a road.\n\nSource: It for you / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn Holding (NYSE:ONON) is doing what competitors like Allbirds (NASDAQ:BIRD) and even Nike (NYSE:NKE) simply can\u2019t these days: adapting to changing consumer trends while maintaining a sufficiently high price point and popularity to keep margins high. All three co-founders also have executive positions in the company today, making On Holding one of the top founder-led companies to watch.\n\nMost interestingly, On\u2019s apparel segment sales climbed 25% in the company\u2019s first-quarter report, yet apparel makes up less than 4% of total sales. On is still a relatively new shoe brand and, on its current trajectory, will likely rapidly expand its apparel segment to more closely match shoe sales and ultimately boost top and bottom-line numbers. By comparison, Nike\u2019s apparel segment comprised more than 25% of total sales. So, by using Nike as a basis for comparison, On Holding has plenty of room to grow peripheral sales streams even as it expands its current 8% share of the US market. To the latter point, On owns 40% of the running shoe market in its home country, Switzerland, creating a blueprint for further US penetration.\n\nHyatt Hotels (H) Hyatt Hotels (H) building with logo in front of shrubbery\n\nSource: EQRoy/Shutterstock.com\n\nHyatt Hotels (NYSE:H) is a bit of an outlier on this list of founder-led companies. The brand\u2019s first hotel opened in 1954, and Jay Pritzker brought the soon-to-be chain and rapidly turned it into an international brand. Though Jay Pritzker passed in 1999, management has kept it in the family \u2014 with Jay\u2019s son, Thomas Pritzker, acting as executive chairman today. Hotel stocks are already seeing a resurgence if travel ETF AdvisorShares Hotel ETF (NYSEARCA:BEDZ) is any indication. Likewise, Hyatt, in particular, is set to rebound rapidly, as evidenced by its 20% gain since January.\n\nHyatt holds less than 10% of the global hotel market share, eclipsed by competitors like Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) at 30%, luxury and destination brand Loews Hotels (NYSE:L) at 20%, and even Hilton (NYSE:HLT) at 13%. But that will likely change soon, as Hyatt has more than 125,000 new rooms in its development pipeline or a 40% increase over current availability. The rapid expansion of this type in a relatively constrained economy is nearly unheard of, let alone for a cyclical industry like hotels and travel \u2014 but Hyatt is bucking the wider trend in a bid to bounce back faster than competitors as wider macro conditions improve.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in FIGS.

        "content": "With so many innovations available in the market, it\u2019s increasingly difficult for investors to pick out viable ideas. That\u2019s where exchange-traded funds come into play. With technology-centric ETFs to buy, buyers can enjoy a wealth of compelling opportunities under one basket. This is especially useful if you have concerns about making decisions.\n\nJust within the tech ecosystem itself, investors have myriad opportunities to choose from. Whether you\u2019re looking at artificial intelligence, semiconductors, cybersecurity or automated solutions, your interests may outweigh the funds available in your wallet. And then comes the more draining part: deciding which specific enterprise has the legs to go the distance.\n\nYou might love Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), for example, but are concerned that it might be overstretched. Well, in that case, you can select a basket of securities that cover NVDA and other enticing prospects. You\u2019re spreading your bets and that may be a prudent decision. With that, below are tech-centric ETFs to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\niShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocks. Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLet\u2019s get right into it. As you might imagine, iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) tracks the benchmark NYSE Semiconductor index, which comprises of U.S. chipmakers. It\u2019s one of the ideal plays among ETFs to buy because it\u2019s so difficult to choose among the individual brands. By acquiring units of the SOXX fund, investors enjoy exposure to a wide range of compelling ideas.\n\nAt the top of the holdings list stands Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). One of the top considerations for AVGO stock is its share split, which occurred late last week. With each share now priced at a more accessible level for retail investors, participation may increase. That\u2019s good for AVGO and that\u2019s also good for the SOXX ETF.\n\nComing in at number two is Nvidia. A lot of investors who missed the boat may have questions about its forward viability. With SOXX, you can get exposure to NVDA while enjoying the collective returns of many other attractive ideas in the semiconductor space. That\u2019s what makes this fund one of the top ETFs to buy.\n\nAmplify Cybersecurity ETF (HACK) a business man pressing a button with an open lock on it that's connected to a symbol of a cloud and various security related icons. cheap cybersecurity stocks. multibagger cybersecurity stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhile everyone loves talking about the productivity gains from technology, people often forget that advances in digitalization also lead to productivity losses. Cybersecurity attacks have evolved from mere nuisances to causing severe financial and economic problems. From a cynical perspective, then, Amplify Cybersecurity ETF (NYSEARCA:HACK) ranks among the ETFs to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the issue with cybersecurity stocks is that there are so many of them. Further, they may have different niche strengths, from end-to-end enterprise-level services to cloud-network protection to solutions for individual computer users. It\u2019s difficult to know which idea will emerge as the runaway success story and that\u2019s where HACK comes into view.\n\nIts top holding is Broadcom, which offers its Symantec Enterprise Cloud solution. Coming in second place is Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), which is an arguably underrated cybersecurity play. Rounding out the top three is Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), which is a leader in endpoint protection services.\n\nNot surprisingly, HACK is up over 11% on a year-to-date basis. However, investors should be aware that the expense ratio is a bit on the high side at 0.6%. In contrast, the category average is 0.53%.\n\nFirst Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence & Robotics ETF (ROBT) AI stocks to buy now, Graphic of letters \"AI\" in bold font surrounded by circle of tech symbols in purple and blue against a dark background. ai stocks to buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Tex vector\n\nFor those that want to dial up their risk-reward profile, speculators should consider First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence & Robotics ETF (NASDAQ:ROBT). It\u2019s a mouthful but it\u2019s an intriguing concept. The ROBT fund tracks an index called the Nasdaq CTA Artificial Intelligence and Robotics index. With so much money poured into the broader field of automation, ROBT presents a wide canvas.\n\nInterestingly, its top holding is ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), which is an application software firm that promotes end-to-end intelligent workflow automation solutions for digital businesses. Analysts anticipate big growth for the company, with fiscal 2024 sales potentially rising by 21.4% to $10.89 billion. Coming in second is Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), a big data analytics firm. PLTR has been attracting the spotlight lately as it marches higher, backed by rising sales.\n\nStill, not everything is so rosy with ROBT. Before stepping foot into the arena, investors should realize that it\u2019s a low-volume fund. Further, the performance has been disappointing, only inching into positive territory for the year. Still, the speculation is that ROBT is one of the ETFs to buy based on its forward potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "content": "It\u2019s about as embarrassing of a situation as a telecommunications firm can find itself in. Recently, AT&T (NYSE:T) revealed that it suffered a major data breach. About the only positive here is for cybersecurity stocks. This sector will likely see a sustained swing higher as data security concerns make headlines once again.\n\nBetween May 1, 2022 and Oct. 31 of that year, \u201cnearly all\u201d of the carrier\u2019s cellular customers had their call records and texts exposed. Fortunately, the breach doesn\u2019t include the content of the calls or texts. Also, the breach does not include sensitive information such as Social Security numbers or date of birth. Still, it\u2019s a major privacy violation.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more ignominious, AT&T had to pay a ransom for about $370,000 \u2013 in cryptocurrencies, of course. This factor too could positively affect cybersecurity stocks. Essentially, hackers are realizing that crime does pay and so they\u2019ll continue engaging in nefarious activities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSadly, the idea of negotiating with hackers in exchange for crypto has become normalized. People and enterprises must protect themselves. With that, below are cybersecurity stocks to consider.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top cybersecurity stocks in the business, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) has made a name for itself primarily through its next-generation firewalls. This innovation provides advanced threat protection, intrusion prevention and visibility to operational functionality. Further, Palo Alto provides a range of security products, including endpoint protection and cloud security.\n\nWith the costs of cyberbreaches consistently rising, it\u2019s never been more important for enterprises to seek protection. That\u2019s not just a narrative as Palo Alto has benefited financially from its superior products. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average earnings per share of $1.40. This handily beat the average analyst estimate of $1.25, yielding an earnings surprise of 12.35%.\n\nTo be fair, investors will be paying a premium for the performance. Shares trade hands at 15.3X trailing-year sales. That\u2019s noticeably above the trailing-year average of about 12.8X. Still, the point to consider is the business expansion. In fiscal 2024, sales could rise by 16.1% to $8 billion. And in the following year, revenue may hit $9.11 billion.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Not surprisingly, CRWD stock has been on the move, gaining nearly 53% since the start of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancially, CrowdStrike continues to outperform analysts\u2019 expectations. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average EPS of 86 cents. This figure beat out the expected tally of 75 cents. Further, the earnings surprise landed at an impressive 15.83%.\n\nIf there is a drawback to CRWD stock, it\u2019s that everyone apparently loves it. Shares trade hands at 27.82X trailing-year sales. That\u2019s a gargantuan multiple. It\u2019s also much higher than the average multiple of 18.4X seen during the past one-year period.\n\nNevertheless, the upside here is the analyst projections. For fiscal 2025 (calendar 2024), experts believe that sales could hit $4 billion. If so, that would be up 30.8% from the prior year. In fiscal 2026, revenue could clock in at $5.05 billion, up 26.3%. It\u2019s one of the cybersecurity stocks to watch.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Sunnyvale, California, Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) offers a wide range of integrated cybersecurity solutions. These include firewalls, antivirus programs and threat-prevention systems. Notably, its mainline firewall product is one of the industry\u2019s most advanced, delivering a mixture of robust performance and extensive security features. The company also specializes in end-to-end security, presenting a formidable defensive network.\n\nWhile enterprise spending may be a concern for the broader software space, going without adequate cybersecurity protection could be a business liability. Thus, it\u2019s no shock that Fortinet has outperformed analyst expectations. In the past four quarters, Fortinet posted an average EPS of 43 cents, beating out the consensus view of 38 cents. This yielded an earnings surprise of 14.38%.\n\nWhat\u2019s perhaps most attractive about FTNT stock is the valuation. Currently, shares trade hands at 8.64X trailing-year sales. While elevated against the software industry, the market previously priced FTNT (during the past year) at 10.67X.\n\nFurther, experts believe that sales could hit $5.8 billion this year, implying growth of 9.3%. Revenue could rise to $6.54 billion in the following year, making FTNT an attractive wager among cybersecurity stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto\u00a0held a LONG position in T stock.

        "content": "CrowdStrike\u2019s CRWD shares have jumped 47.8% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Internet - Software industry\u2019s growth of 12.7% and the Zacks Computer and Technology Sector\u2019s return of 28.6%. The growth reflects the company\u2019s innovative product line and positive response from the customers.\n\nCrowdStrike recently unveiled Falcon Complete Next-Gen Managed Detection and Response (MDR) to prevent cyber breaches through rapid and precise response. This solution secures the whole enterprise and not just the endpoints, identity and cloud. The Falcon Complete Next-Gen MDR uses third-party data from Falcon Next-Gen SIEM and leverages artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities as well.\n\nFalcon Complete Next-Gen MDR provides unified visibility by connecting data from all the platforms in one place. The architecture has been able to speed up cyber analysts\u2019 forensic processes by 75%. Moreover, CRWD uses its own analysts to take immediate and precise actions to prevent breaches as soon as they start.\n\nThe solution will enable CrowdStrike to improve its relationship with its partners. The company\u2019s partners will now be able to manage large amounts of security data, detect threats quickly, and reduce costs and complexity, all while keeping its customers happy.\n\nCrowdStrike Price and Consensus\n\nCrowdStrike price-consensus-chart | CrowdStrike Quote\n\nCrowdStrike Enhances Its Product Portfolio\n\nThe Falcon Complete Next-Gen MDR is one of the many products that CrowdStrike has launched this year. Other offerings include CrowdStrike Falcon for Insurability, Falcon for Defender and Falcon Next-Gen SIEM ISV Ecosystem. CRWD has also released Falcon Application Security Posture Management to the general public as an integrated part of CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon Cloud Security platform to counter breaches from code to cloud.\n\nSo far this year, CrowdStrike has partnered with industry giants like Google Cloud, Cloudflare NET, NVIDIA NVDA and Amazon\u2019s AMZN Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) to improve its offerings.\n\nIn the field of AI, CRWD has partnered with Google Cloud and Cloudflare. CrowdStrike and Google Cloud together are improving MDR using CRWD\u2019s Falcon and Google Cloud\u2019s Security Operations platforms. CrowdStrike is also improving its Falcon cybersecurity platform by combining Cloudflare One with Falcon Next-Gen SIEM.\n\nIn the field of generative AI, CrowdStrike has partnered with NVIDIA to improve its CrowdStrike Falcon XDR platform by integrating NVIDIA\u2019s GPU-optimized AI pipelines and software. CRWD is also leveraging AWS services, including Amazon Bedrock and AWS SageMaker, to improve its cloud security innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetition and Near-Term Challenges\n\nBehind the curtains of several product launches lies the intense competition that CrowdStrike is facing in the cybersecurity space. The company is broadening its capabilities to survive in this highly competitive market. Over the past few years, CRWD has also invested heavily to enhance its sales and marketing capabilities to beat its competitors in capturing market share. As a result, its sales and marketing expenses have almost tripled in the past three fiscals from $601 million in fiscal 2021 to $1.72 billion in fiscal 2024.\n\nThe competitive landscape is also putting pricing pressure on CRWD. As the cybersecurity market evolves, CrowdStrike faces threats from existing large competitors and new entrants as well. In the long run, this could lead CRWD to resort to competitive pricing to maintain and capture the market share.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s near-term prospects might be hurt by softening IT spending. The still-high interest rates and protracted inflationary conditions have impacted consumer spending. Meanwhile, enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues.\n\nSome of the cybersecurity players have already pointed out that organizations are delaying or taking more time in finalizing deals or even rightsizing deals in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment. This makes us slightly cautious about CrowdStrike\u2019s prospects in the near term.\n\nConclusion\n\nCrowdStrike is expanding its product offerings rapidly to survive in the competitive landscape of cybersecurity, which experiences new types of cyber breaches every now and then. These product releases and partnerships are expected to benefit the company in the long run.\n\nHowever, the near-term growth prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending. Intensifying competition in the security application market is a concern. Elevated operating expenses may remain overhangs on this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company\u2019s margins.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned -3.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has lost 0.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.99 per share, indicating a change of +33.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.99 points to a change of +29.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.7%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.84 indicates a change of +21.3% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, CrowdStrike is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRWD _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $960.11 million indicates a year-over-year change of +31.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $4 billion and $5.02 billion estimates indicate +30.9% and +25.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $921.04 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +33%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.57 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $904.82 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.79%. The EPS surprise was +4.49%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Just Loaded Up on Stocks: 6 Companies She Just Bought",
        "content": "Between fundraising, legislating, and engaging in a number of other responsibilities, the politicians who serve in Washington, D.C., are busy. Many of them, however, find enough time to buy and sell stocks. And because many politicians demonstrate an uncanny ability to outperform the market, ordinary investors are keen to know the stock trades of senators and representatives.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia who sits on the Oversight and Reform Committee and the Homeland Security Committee, recently submitted regulatory filings that acknowledged six recent stock purchases in late June: ASML(NASDAQ: ASML), Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST), CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), Lululemon Athletica(NASDAQ: LULU), Nestle(OTC: NSRGY), and NextEraEnergy(NYSE: NEE). Although the exact value of each transaction wasn't reported, all six trades were valued between $1,001 and $15,000.\n\nThe deets on Greene's newest holdings\n\nAlthough Greene didn't provide any commentary regarding the thinking behind her stock purchases, there are some clear reasons that could've motivated her decision making. Consistent with the market's overwhelming interest in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, two of Greene's recent picks have significant AI exposure. ASML manufactures equipment that semiconductor manufacturers require for making microchips. Encouraging news broke prior to Green's purchase that TaiwanSemiconductorManufacturing would be purchasing ASML's extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machine earlier than expected. Providing sophisticated cloud-based cybersecurity solutions, CrowdStrike helps customers -- with help from AI -- protect various devices such as laptops, mobile devices, and those connected on the Internet of Things. The company recently reported strong results for its fiscal first quarter of 2025, ended April 30, including year-over-year diluted earnings-per-share (EPS) and free-cash-flow increases of 63% and 42%, respectively.\n\nStretching out to the world of retail apparel, Greene scooped up shares of activewear powerhouse Lululemon. Shares of Lululemon had plunged 33% from the start of the year to June 23, the day before Greene clicked the buy button. It's likely that the company's auspicious outlook for 2024 played a pivotal role in her decision-making. In its release of its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2024, ended April 28, management forecast top-line year-over-year growth of 11% to 12% for 2024, and diluted EPS to rise from 17% to 19%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWarehouse club superstar Costco also made its way onto Green's buy list. In early June, Costco reported sales in May had risen 6.4% compared to May 2023. And the growth didn't just occur for one month. The company also noted that revenue in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024 had climbed 5.4% compared to the same period last year.\n\nEvidently, Greene also recognized a tasty opportunity with Nestle stock. Perhaps it was management's outlook for 2024 -- guidance that it reaffirmed during a business update in April -- that Greene found appetizing. In addition to organic sales rising 4%, management projected EPS growth between 6% and 10% for 2024. Or maybe it was Greene's hunger for passive income that was the source of motivation. Currently, Nestle stock offers a forward dividend yield of 3.1%.\n\nLastly, Greene chose to power her portfolio with NextEra Energy, a renewable energy powerhouse that performed exceptionally well in the first half of 2024. And while the company's future isn't guaranteed, a look at the company's past suggests that it has a history of growth -- a trend that it can certainly extend in the future. Over the past 20 years, for example, NextEra Energy has achieved compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) of 9% and 8% for adjusted EPS and operating cash flow, respectively. During the same period, the company maintained focus on rewarding shareholders, hiking its dividend at a 10% CAGR.\n\nShould you make the same buys?\n\nAs savvy investors know, monitoring politicians' stock picks is a smart strategy. Rushing to copy the stock moves that politicians just made, however? Not so much. That being said, ASML and CrowdStrike are two excellent options for tech-focused investors who want to lean into AI and are certainly worth further investigation. Similarly, Lululemon and Costco are two premier consumer-focused companies that can bolster one's portfolio.\n\nNestle, on the other hand, has a history of underperforming the market, and it doesn't seem like there's a catalyst to change that in the near future.

        "title": "Q1 Earnings Highlights: Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) Vs The Rest Of The Cybersecurity Stocks",
        "content": "Q1 Earnings Highlights: Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) Vs The Rest Of The Cybersecurity Stocks\n\nAs the craze of earnings season draws to a close, here's a look back at some of the most exciting (and some less so) results from Q1. Today, we are looking at cybersecurity stocks, starting with Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA).\n\nCybersecurity continues to be one of the fastest-growing segments within software for good reason. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing rising cybersecurity risks. Businesses are accelerating adoption of cloud-based software, moving data and applications into the cloud to save costs while improving performance. This migration has opened them to a multitude of new threats, like employees accessing data via their smartphone while on an open network, or logging into a web-based interface from a laptop in a new location.\n\nThe 9 cybersecurity stocks we track reported a slower Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.4%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.5% below consensus. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, but cybersecurity stocks have shown resilience, with share prices up 7% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nOkta (NASDAQ:OKTA)\n\nFounded during the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009, Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) is a cloud-based software-as-a-service platform that helps companies manage identity for their employees and customers.\n\nOkta reported revenues of $617 million, up 19.1% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 2.1%. Overall, it was a solid quarter for the company with optimistic revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decent beat of analysts' ARR (annual recurring revenue) estimates.\n\n\u201cWe began the new fiscal year with record non-GAAP profitability and cash flow as we continue to benefit from the operating efficiency actions we\u2019ve taken over the past several quarters,\u201d said Todd McKinnon, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Okta. Okta Total Revenue\n\nOkta achieved the highest full-year guidance raise of the whole group. The stock is up 2.6% since reporting and currently trades at $98.92.\n\nIs now the time to buy Okta? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it's free.\n\nBest Q1: Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS)\n\nAfter successfully selling all four of his previous cybersecurity companies, Jay Chaudhry's fifth venture, Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) offers software-as-a-service that helps companies securely connect to applications and networks in the cloud.\n\nStory continues\n\nZscaler reported revenues of $553.2 million, up 32.1% year on year, outperforming analysts' expectations by 3.2%. It was a very strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts' billings estimates and a solid beat of analysts' ARR (annual recurring revenue) estimates. Zscaler Total Revenue\n\nZscaler pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 31.5% since reporting. It currently trades at $204.49.\n\nIs now the time to buy Zscaler? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it's free.\n\nWeakest Q1: Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD)\n\nFounded in 2000 with the idea that network security comes before endpoint security, Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) provides software as a service that helps companies understand where they are exposed to cyber security risks, quickly detect breaches and respond to them.\n\nRapid7 reported revenues of $205.1 million, up 12% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was a weak quarter for the company with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and decelerating customer growth.\n\nRapid7 had the weakest full-year guidance update in the group. The company lost -64 customers and ended up with a total of 11,462. As expected, the stock is down 13.4% since the results and currently trades at $39.69.\n\nRead our full analysis of Rapid7's results here.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nFounded in 2005 by cybersecurity engineer Nir Zuk, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) makes hardware and software cybersecurity products that protect companies from cyberattacks, breaches, and malware threats.\n\nPalo Alto Networks reported revenues of $1.98 billion, up 15.3% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. Overall, it was an ok quarter for the company with a narrow beat of analysts' billings estimates but a decline in its gross margin.\n\nThe stock is up 5.5% since reporting and currently trades at $341.96.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Palo Alto Networks here, it's free.\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD)\n\nFounded by George Kurtz, the former CTO of the antivirus company McAfee, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) provides cybersecurity software that protects companies from breaches and helps them detect and respond to cyber attacks.\n\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $921 million, up 33% year on year, surpassing analysts' expectations by 1.8%. Overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with a narrow beat of analysts' ARR (annual recurring revenue) estimates but a miss of analysts' billings estimates.\n\nThe stock is up 24.3% since reporting and currently trades at $379.89.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on CrowdStrike here, it's free.\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.

        "content": "The S&P 500 is the hallmark of portfolio diversification. When most investors aim to \u201cbeat the market,\u201d they are talking about this index. It contains 500 profitable publicly traded corporations, with allocations weighted by market cap. For instance, investors will have the most exposure to the largest publicly traded corporation and the least exposure to the 500th largest company on the list.\n\nThis index routinely adds and removes stocks based on financial performance and other factors. Furthermore, it\u2019s not easy to get into the S&P 500. A company must fulfill several requirements, such as having a sufficient market cap and reporting a profitable year.\n\nAlthough many investors use index investing to match the market, it\u2019s possible to outperform the S&P 500. These growth stocks have lived up to the premise and have outpaced the S&P 500 so far. Investors may want to take a closer look at these growth stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalmart (WMT) An image of a Canoo, Inc. (GOEV) Walmart electric delivery vehicle\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is a haven for consumers who want to protect their wallets and buy affordable products. The company can deliver solid earnings during the good times and remain resilient during economic downturns. Walmart has delivered a 30% year-to-date gain, which outpaces the S&P 500\u2019s 18% year-to-date gain.\n\nWalmart also offers a 1.20% yield for its investors. While dividend growth has been an issue in previous years, the company recently announced a 9% dividend hike \u2014 the highest dividend increase in more than a decade.\n\nQ1 FY25 financial results suggest that Walmart can continue the rally. Revenue increased by 6.0% year-over-year in that quarter, while adjusted EPS was up by 22.4% year-over-year. Global e-commerce sales were a major highlight, increasing by 21% year-over-year. Store-fulfilled pickups and deliveries continue to pick up momentum. Investors should also monitor the small but growing advertising segment, which reported 24% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s hard to talk about outperforming the S&P 500 without mentioning at least one of the Magnificent Seven stocks. These stocks have carried the index to new heights for several years and heavily influence the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks, delivering a 30% year-to-date return. Online marketplace sales continue to grow and achieve double-digit revenue growth in domestic and international markets. That wasn\u2019t the only highlight from Q1 2024 results. While overall revenue increased by 13% year-over-year, the company also reported 17% revenue growth for Amazon Web Services. That part of Amazon\u2019s business generated $25.0 billion in the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile e-commerce and cloud computing are Amazon\u2019s core specialties, the company is making strides in the advertising market. The tech giant reported $11.8 billion in ad revenue this quarter, a 24% year-over-year increase. Amazon thrives in multiple industries, which should lead to long-term gains for patient investors.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) Graphic of yellow money bag next to green arrow and coins floating in air, symbolizing growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Monster Ztudio\n\nNu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is a Brazilian digital bank that offers a wide range of financial products and services to the Latin American community. Shares have logged a 65% year-to-date return. It helps that the company recently surpassed 100 million users, most of whom are active.\n\nThe digital bank reported an 83% activity rate at the end of the first quarter. This rate demonstrates that 83% of the company\u2019s 100 million customers are active monthly. The bank has more than 83 million monthly active users, and they use multiple financial products. Nu Holdings reported 69% year-over-year revenue growth as customers used the bank\u2019s personal loans, credit cards, bank accounts, brokerage accounts and other resources.\n\nWall Street analysts still believe that the stock can rise. Seven analysts rate it a Strong Buy, with a projected 5% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $15.20 per share suggests the stock can gain an additional 13%.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been outperforming the stock market for several years. It has almost quadrupled over the past five years and is up 28% year-to-date. The Mexican Grill chain recently completed a 50-for-1 stock split and has been under a correction ever since. This correction presents an opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nThe company continues to grow at a robust pace. Revenue increased by 14.1% year-over-year to reach $2.7 billion in the first quarter, and net income rose by 23.2% year-over-year to reach $259.3 million. Chipotle opened 47 new restaurants this quarter and remains on pace to open 285-315 restaurants throughout the year.\n\nRestaurant expansion isn\u2019t the only reason Chipotle\u2019s revenue is still rising. The company reported 7.0% year-over-year growth in comparable restaurant sales. Wall Street analysts are on board and have rated the stock as a Moderate Buy. The average price target suggests a 16% upside, while the highest price target of $80 per share indicates that a 38% gain is possible.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another member of the Magnificent Seven that has outperformed the S&P 500 over a lengthy amount of time, including this year. Facebook\u2019s parent company has logged a 44% year-to-date gain and comes with a 0.40% yield. The stock trades at a 29 P/E ratio and trades at a $1.26 trillion valuation.\n\nThe social media giant closed out the first quarter with 3.24 billion daily active users, 7% higher than the same time last year. Meta Platforms\u2019 large user base allows it to experiment with new products and AI offerings. As it works on new initiatives, the company performs well with its current business model. Revenue increased by 27% year over year, while net income surged by 117% year over year.\n\nMeta Platforms remain a big hit on Wall Street. The stock is rated a Strong Buy with a projected 6% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $625 per share suggests the company can rally by an additional 25%.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) isn\u2019t as big as Chipotle, but the steakhouse chain has momentum and a more reasonable valuation. The stock trades at a 34 P/E ratio and offers a 1.44% yield. Shares are up by 42% year-to-date and have more than tripled over the past five years.\n\nThe steakhouse chain reported 12.5% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. Net income jumped by 31.9% year-over-year, which should help the company maintain a double-digit dividend growth rate. Texas Roadhouse opened 12 restaurants in the quarter, including three franchises. The steakhouse chain\u2019s comparable sales increased by 8.4% year-over-year at company-owned restaurants. The growth rate came in at 7.7% for franchise restaurants. Both growth rates are respectable and demonstrate that Texas Roadhouse is becoming a fixture in numerous communities.\n\nWall Street analysts have rated the stock as a Moderate Buy. The average price target only implies a 3% upside, but the highest price target of $191 per share suggests a potential 13% gain.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been crushing the stock market. The cybersecurity firm is a recent addition to the S&P 500, delivering a 50% year-to-date gain. Shares are up by more than 400% over the past five years.\n\nThe company operates in an industry projected to grow for many years. Cybersecurity is projected to maintain a compounded annual growth rate of 13.8% until 2030. Many companies will benefit from the industry\u2019s success, but few are as well-positioned as Crowdstrike.\n\nWhile other cybersecurity companies have reported decelerating revenue growth, Crowdstrike continues to charge ahead. The company reported 33% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Crowdstrike operates on a subscription business model and currently has $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue. Profits are also surging, going from $0.5 million in the same quarter last year to $42.8 million in this quarter.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AMZN, TXRH, and CRWD.

        "content": "The frequency and cost of cyberattacks worldwide have been seeing an unprecedented rise. According to Security Magazine, there are 2,220 cyberattacks every day, translating to one cyberattack every 39 seconds. The global cybercrime costs are expected to reach a mind-boggling $10.5 trillion by 2025.\n\nHence, it is no surprise that cybersecurity solutions, which protect sensitive data and prevent operational disruptions, are mission-critical for maintaining the reputation and brand of organizations worldwide.\n\nCybersecurity specialist CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) is successfully capitalizing on this expanding market opportunity. The stock has had a dream run in the past year, soaring 165%. Furthermore, despite the solid recent gains, the stock is looking like an exceptional pick for the coming decade. Here's why CrowdStrike can be a compelling choice for astute investors.\n\nMultiple growth avenues\n\nCrowdStrike's cloud-native artificial intelligence (AI)-powered Falcon platform has 28 modules catering to a wide range of cybersecurity needs. Hence, organizations are increasingly simplifying their security stacks by replacing multiple pinpoint security solutions with Falcon modules. CrowdStrike's strategy of positioning itself as a consolidation play is proving successful, considering that the number of deals involving eight-plus Falcon modules has grown 95% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended March 31, 2024).\n\nThe number of deals involving Falcon identity, cloud, or Next-Gen Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) modules also more than doubled year over year in Q1. Furthermore, demand for new platform innovations such as data protection modules and Charlotte AI (the generative-AI powered cybersecurity assistant integrated into the Falcon platform to let users analyze, understand, and manage cyberthreats effectively) is also picking up steam.\n\nThe introduction of the Falcon Flex subscription model (a flexible licensing approach that allows organizations to scale up or down their cybersecurity capabilities as per their needs) has further boosted the adoption of CrowdStrike's Falcon platform. The new licensing model has generated over $500 million in deal value in the last three quarters.\n\nCrowdStrike's management remains committed to reaching $10 billion in annualized recurring revenue (ARR, a metric to gauge the health of subscription business) by calendar year 2028. The company's ARR was up year over year by 33% to $3.65 billion at the end of the first quarter.\n\nWhile reaching the $10 billion ARR target seems daunting (requiring the company to continue its 30%-plus year-over-year ARR growth trajectory for subsequent quarters), analysts seem to find it a potentially achievable target. They have estimated the company's fiscal 2029 revenue (ending Jan. 31, 2029) to be nearly $10.5 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nRapidly improving financials\n\nBesides impressive revenue targets, CrowdStrike also boasts rapidly improving profitability and robust free cash flows. The company has been GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) profitable for five consecutive quarters. CrowdStrike expects fiscal 2025 non-GAAP net income to fall between $985.6 million to $1.012 million.\n\nCrowdStrike reported a record free cash flow (FCF) of $322 million in the first quarter, up 42% on a year-over-year basis and accounting for nearly 35% of its Q1 revenue. The company is guiding for its FCF margin to be 31% to 33% of revenue in fiscal 2025.\n\nStrategic partnerships and talent acquisition\n\nThe company has been expanding its partner ecosystem, which includes cloud service providers, Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs), and Manage Detection and Response (MDR) providers. The MSSP and MDR partners have been a major source of new customer acquisition, as they are actively migrating their customers from point products and multi-platform security products to the Falcon platform.\n\nCrowdStrike has also been quite successful in attracting top-tier talent, as is evident from the 687,000 applications secured from people keen on working for the company just in the past five quarters -- and the company hires just a small fraction of that amount.\n\nValuation and growth potential\n\nWhile it is impossible to accurately predict the future, we can build some reasonable expectations about CrowdStrike's future growth trajectory based on consensus analyst estimates.\n\nAnalysts expect CrowdStrike's revenue to grow by almost ninefold, from $3 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31, 2024) to about $27 billion in fiscal 2034. The stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 28.8. Assuming that the multiple reverts to its five-year average of 29.3, we can expect its market capitalization to be around $791 billion -- almost 8.3 times its current market capitalization of $95 billion.\n\nHence, the stock could be a multibagger, according to consensus analyst estimates.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "One of the most important factors for investors to consider is growth. But how does one easily identify which companies are doing the best job growing? My solution is to look to the Portfolio Grader for A-rated growth stocks.\n\nWhile it\u2019s great that a stock is seeing gains over the last few weeks or months, growth is the name of the game, a fundamental aspect of success and sustainability. Companies that are seeing growth are more likely to remain strong and be long-term investments.\n\nCompanies need growth to scale and improve efficiency. If you\u2019re a car manufacturer and selling 30 cars per month, you\u2019re absorbing a lot of overhead to make those vehicles \u2013 and you\u2019re likely not turning a profit. But if you\u2019re making 3,000 vehicles, your per-unit costs go way down. That\u2019s how companies become profitable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGrowth enables a company to expand its market share. By increasing sales and acquiring new customers, companies become stronger and eventually, with enough growth, becomes a leader in their industries.\n\nI\u2019ve selected several A-rated growth stocks to review, based on their outstanding overall grades in the Portfolio Grader. The Portfolio Grader considers a variety of factors, including growth, earnings performance, analyst sentiment and momentum. So, A-rated stocks are the strongest overall companies in the market.\n\nBut what makes these A-rated growth stocks stand out today is that all the companies we\u2019re going to consider also get either an \u201cA\u201d or a \u201cB\u201d grade in the Portfolio Grader for growth.\n\nYou can expect each of these A-rated growth stocks to continue to perform, because the companies they represent are successfully expanding \u2013 and you can see it in the bottom line.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) may be the most compelling stock in the market. As the maker of powerful graphics processing units that are used to power top-line artificial intelligence programs, Nvidia stock soared to previously unimaginable heights. The stock is up 220% over the last 12 months and 170% so far this year.\n\nBut interestingly, Nvidia seems to be on a bit of a break. Since June 18, the stock is up only 3%, raising concerns from some nervous investors that we may finally be nearing a top.\n\nNonsense.\n\nI think it\u2019s more likely that this is just part of the Wall Street summer doldrums \u2013 when the market sees less activity from Memorial Day to Labor day. But remember that Nvidia\u2019s next earnings release is scheduled for Aug. 21, so this hiatus will surely come to an end sooner rather than later.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdjusted earnings for Nvidia were up 461% in the most recently reported quarter. And since earnings are far outpacing the stock\u2019s growth, Nvidia stock is getting cheaper every day on a valuation basis, which makes it among the A-rated growth stocks you need in your portfolio.\n\nNVDA stock gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for both growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) Google headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nSource: achinthamb / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL), is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo. It\u2019s responsible for the Chome search engine and Android smartphones. Alphabet is a powerhouse that\u2019s taken its rightful place, as has Nvidia, as a Magnificent 7 stock.\n\nSo then, why is the CEO selling shares?\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly sold\u00a022,500 Alphabet shares\u00a0on June 20, raising some investor eyebrows. I wrote about it recently for InvestorPlace, and as I said then, Pichai still has 227,000 shares of GOOG stock, so I\u2019m not concerned at all. In fact, this is more of a position-trimming move than anything else.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to be bullish about Alphabet, including its massive position in internet search and the dominance of the Chrome browser. Alphabet brought in $80.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 15% from a year ago. Its operating income was up 32% to $25.4 billion.\n\nGOOG stock is up 36% in 2024. It gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and an \u201cA\u201d overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis is the third and last Magnificent 7 stock we\u2019ll talk about today. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the operator of the powerful social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Reels.\n\nFamously founded by Mark Zuckerburg and friends at Harvard University, Meta is powerful because it encourages users to connect with friends and family and make new connections.\n\nPeople who use Facebook and Instagram willingly share their likes and dislikes, where they\u2019ve been and what they plan to do \u2013 and that\u2019s all information that Meta can use to sell to advertisers.\n\nMeta Platforms\u2019 advertising platforms are powerful, there\u2019s no doubt. With all the personal information in Meta\u2019s databases, advertisers can make extremely targeted advertising campaigns.\n\nThat\u2019s why Meta brought in $36.4 billion in advertising revenue in the first quarter, making up roughly 98% of its total revenue. Advertising dollars were up 23% from a year ago, making this one of the A-rated growth stocks to keep your eyes on.\n\nI\u2019m expecting that trend to continue and META stock to pop again when the company reports earnings on July 31. For now, Meta stock is up 51% in 2024, and its gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle restaurant store exterior sign and storefront. CMG stock\n\nSource: Robert V Schwemmer / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s not too often you see a company with a 50-to-1 stock split, as Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) executed this summer. But I like it because it\u2019s a sign of management that is very deliberate in its actions.\n\nChipotle stock topped $3,200 per share \u2013 an enormous number \u2013 before its June 25 split, making it one of the biggest in the history of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe split makes the stock more accessible and attractive to retail investors as well as employees who want to participate in the company\u2019s stock purchase plan \u2013 it was a good move all around.\n\nI also see the move as part of the company\u2019s culture. Remember, this is a restaurant stock with more than 3,400 locations, but no franchises. Chipotle maintains ownership of every location because it\u2019s the only way it can ensure company quality and standards.\n\nChipotle also famously doesn\u2019t have any freezers in its locations, which means that the ingredients for its burritos, salads and burrito bowls must always be made fresh.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $2.7 billion, up 14.1% from a year ago. Comparable restaurant sales were up 7% and operating margins rose from 15.5% to 16.3%. The company is reporting second-quarter earnings on July 24.\n\nCMG stock is up 27% in 2024. It gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and an \u201cA\u201d overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) isn\u2019t part of the Magnificent 7. But if the list ever expands to eight or 10 stocks, it might be difficult to keep Supermicro off the list.\n\nSupermicro makes the server infrastructure that is needed by companies that are buying up all the Nvidia GPUs to build large language models and other generative AI products. Supermicro can provide custom server architecture solutions to bundle those GPUs and allow them to work together.\n\nSupermicro is reportedly providing and assembling half of the racks AI-supercomputer racks that xAI, the artificial intelligence startup operated by Elon Musk, is creating to develop an AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\n\nThe company is seeing massive growth, with sales of $3.85 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, up from $1.28 billion a year ago. Net income of $402 million was up from $86 million a year ago.\n\nAnd don\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s another SMCI catalyst next week. Typically, Supermicro pre-announces between 18 and 24 days after the end of the quarter, so that could be as early as next week. Should the company provide evidence of another blowout quarter and/or dazzling guidance, SMCI stock will surely jump.\n\nSMCI stock is up 216% in 2024. It gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a computer security company that uses AI and machine learning to stop threats in real time. Its cloud-native platform that provides endpoint protection, cloud workloads, identity and data.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform is its primary product, but CrowdStrike also offers modules that companies can use to customize their products.\n\nThe modules, which include things like endpoint security, data security, IT operations, threat intelligence and more, serves as a successful business plan because customers can always start small and add on as they go.\n\nCrowdStrike says 65% of its customers purchase and use at least five modules. Revenue for the company\u2019s first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $921 million, up 33% from a year ago. Subscription revenue was $872.2 million, up 34% from the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nIt also got a boost last month when CWRD stock was added to the S&P 500, which means that exchange-traded funds and other products that track the index are buying CRWD stock.\n\nCrowdStrike stock is up 47% this year. It gets \u201cA\u201d rating for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was famously one of the original FAANG stocks that were considered market darlings before the rise of AI and the Magnificent 7. But Netflix, which is the premiere streaming service, hasn\u2019t really gone away.\n\nIn fact, the stock has only gotten better.\n\nNetflix management made a huge decision when it ended its free password sharing program. Before, the company all but encouraged the practice and password sharing was common between friends, family and partners was common.\n\nBut the company finally acknowledged that it was leaving a lot of money on the table, so the program came to an end. Netflix instituted an $8 monthly charge to any account that was sharing a password with someone outside the physical household. And now paid memberships are up from 232.6 million a year ago to 269.6 million in the last quarter.\n\nRevenue also grew \u2013 up 14.8% to $9.3 billion, and the stock returned to levels not seen since 2015.\n\nNFLX stock is up 39% this year, and gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had LONG position(s) in NVDA, SMCI and CRWD.\u00a0Louis Navellier did not have (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had LONG positions in NVDA, SMCI and CRWD.

        "content": "More companies and individuals are storing valuable data in the internet. While the internet has allowed people and organizations to become more efficient and access more choices, it also presents risks. Hackers can infiltrate databases and get access to sensitive data.\u00a0This increase in risks present online has provided some tailwinds for cybersecurity stocks and the companies they represent.\n\nCybersecurity firms minimize the risk and allow people to use the internet in a safe and secure manner. These companies shield businesses from cyber criminals. Cybersecurity professionals use software to detect and address issues before they get serious.\n\nInvestors can profit by finding industries with high demand and plenty of growth prospects. As data continues to proliferate the web, cybersecurity companies should continue to experience impressive growth rates. The cybersecurity market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 9.7% from now until 2030. Several corporations have positioned themselves to benefit from tailwinds.

Investors who like Crowdstrike as a company, but believe the valuation is overstretched, may want to give CommVault Systems a closer look.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street hasn\u2019t been covering this stock as much, but a recent price target of $140 per share suggests a 13% upside from current levels. CommVault System\u2019s revenue and earnings have been accelerating in recent years.

        "content": "With the AI boom, it\u2019s no surprise that many sectors will experience heightened growth. One such sector for investors to take advantage of is cybersecurity. The cybersecurity sector has more than ample room to grow, with the demand for stronger encryption resulting from more prevalent and sophisticated cyberattacks. However, despite industry growth, there are still ample undervalued cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nThe cybersecurity industry is set to grow to $424.8 billion at a 13.8% CAGR. This growth rate is derived from new platforms and technologies, such as e-commerce platforms and cloud innovations, requiring improved security to prevent cyberattacks. The incorporation of new technologies into cybersecurity, specifically automations through artificial intelligence (AI), improves security solutions within the cybersecurity sector.\n\nThese factors combined indicate that the cybersecurity industry to be undervalued compared to its future value. Catch these undervalued security stocks with my three picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) that provides oversight services for cloud applications, services and databases through a SaaS data analytics platform. Yahoo! Finance reports 42 analysts predicting a one-year price range on S between $98.00 and $146.84, with a mean of $230.00.\n\nDDOG reports robust financials for Q1 2024. The company beat earning for both revenue and EPS, with EPS standing out by beating expectations by 25.83%. Revenue growth has outpaced operational expenses growth, demonstrating sustainable growth practices. Additionally, with net income growing 276.99 % year-over-year (YOY), DDOG shows potential for growth beyond its current valuation.\n\nDatadog announced the launch of its new product: Data Jobs Offering. By improving troubleshooting abilities for data engineer\u2019s work, the product is able to optimize jobs runs by identifying issues with record speed. These features can significantly reduce operational costs for clients. Additionally, DDOG has improved its LLM Observability service to identify issues like hallucinations in Generative AI applications. This update offers growth potential as businesses rush to get these applications on the market and need quality control. Indeed, this expands DDOG\u2019s customer base. Product offerings and improvements make DDOG one of the undervalued cybersecurity stocks for investors.\n\nAkamai Technologies (AKAM) building facade with akamai (AKAM) logo on it. representing tech stocks\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAkamai Technologies (NYSE:AKAM) is a cloud platform company that also offers cybersecurity products and services. Yahoo! Finance reports 26 analysts predicting a one-year price range on AKAM between $90.00 and $135.00, with a mean of $115.27.\n\nStory continues\n\nAKAM demonstrates financial strength. While revenue may seem lackluster from missing Q2 earnings expectations, the company has demonstrated superior profitability. Net income is up 80.65% YOY. Furthermore, the company\u2019s free cash flow for the quarter has grown 605.06% YOY, indicating excellent handling of expenditures by management. ROIC being higher than AKAM WACC indicates that the company will provide returns to its investors which, in tandem with strong profitability, makes Akamai undervalued.\n\nAkamai has recently completed the acquisition of API security company Noname Security. This acquisition bolsters the AKAM\u2019s offerings, in addition to expanding its clients through alliance relationships. This acquisition is timely, with customer demand for API security services growing 200% YOY. AKAM has launched a new cloud based, \u201cmedia-optimized\u201d service specialized for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs. The service specializes in optimizing GPU performance in video processing and live streaming. The company\u2019s current position as one of the undervalued cybersecurity stocks makes AKAM a compelling choice for investors willing to capitalize on this opportunity.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity company specializing in cyber attack response and endpoint security. With the recent surge in AI popularity, CRWD has pushed up more than 50% in the previous 6 months. However, I believe this is one of the undervalued cybersecurity stocks with further room for growth.\n\nDespite strong financial growth, CRWD is still potentially undervalued. As reported in its April 2024 quarterly report, YOY revenue and earnings per share exceeded the lofty expectations. Even with revenue up nearly 33%, the most impressive aspect pushing this stock\u2019s value was its net income increasing by a factor over 65 times. Coupled with 48% increase in free cash flow, further demonstrating improving profitability, a case can be made for CRWD being undervalued.\n\nThe new wave of artificial intelligence is serving the company well. Most recently, the company joined the S&P 500, one of the most traded indices in the market. Consequently, this increases trading volume while bringing attention to the company\u2019s work. Additionally, institutions have taken notice. With over 75% of both available floats and current shares held by institutional investors, there is increasing sentiment regarding the growth potential CRWD holds. Because of the strong financials as well as the current market trends, I advise giving more thought to Crowdstrike.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Matthew Rodrigues\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Buy-and-hold stocks don\u2019t have to be boring. Often, investors looking for buy-and-hold stocks see recommendations centered around what can be called charitably value traps. Alternately, some recommend buy-and-hold stocks based purely on recent outperformance without looking at long-term potential or whether the company is objectively overvalued.\n\nThese buy-and-hold stocks blend the best of both worlds, with recent winds, growth potential, and fundamental underpinnings creating a foundation suitable for any long-term portfolio. Don\u2019t let short-term fluctuations scare you away from their long-term potential, either. Some of these buy-and-hold stocks dropped slightly in recent months, but in all cases, solid tailwinds offer a compelling and viable investment thesis.\n\nRemember to do your own due diligence when finding buy-and-hold stocks, but this list is a strong starting point that captures multiple sectors, company sizes, and opportunities for a well-rounded portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) A close-up of a Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) office in Terra Haute, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) is often at the front of the line for buy-and-hold stocks; this list is no exception.\n\nThe conglomerate\u2019s diverse portfolio includes more than 50 companies across diversified and evergreen industries such as real estate, transportation, energy, and consumer goods. These expansive holdings offer an easy way to achieve a balanced investment portfolio without picking numerous individual stocks.\n\nAdditionally, investing in Berkshire Hathaway means aligning with Warren Buffett\u2019s value-first investment strategies. Likewise, his prudent approach, such as reducing stakes in underperforming stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) to increase cash reserves, demonstrates a strategic \u201crebalancing\u201d tactic that can protect your portfolio from economic downturns. In the future, you can benefit from Buffett\u2019s tactical deployment of that cash to seize opportunities when companies face challenges.\n\nInvesting in Berkshire Hathaway provides a straightforward way to leverage the expertise of one of the world\u2019s most successful investors. For long-term investors, few buy-and-hold stocks offer the stability and growth potential of Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) consistently ranks among the top buy-and-hold dividend stocks for a good reason. Its status as a Dividend Aristocrat, combined with monthly distributions and a solid 5.9% forward yield, makes it a perennial favorite. After a nearly 12% decline over the past year, this stock is attractively priced for long-term investors. Likewise, Realty Income\u2019s operational and fundamental strength remains unchanged, reinforcing its appeal to buyers today.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company boasts an impressive 98% occupancy rate across its properties, with 80% of its retail tenants operating in sectors resilient to economic downturns. Most of these tenants are in the grocery sector, alongside convenience stores, dollar stores, and drugstores. This diverse mix ensures stability and minimizes risk, shielding Realty Income from all but the most severe economic downturns.\n\nRealty Income\u2019s triple-net lease model is another key advantage. This arrangement shifts all operational risks and expenses to the tenants, including property maintenance costs. This effectively shields Realty Income from rising material and labor costs, often associated with higher interest rates. Additionally, with leases typically spanning 15 years or more and renewal options in place, Realty Income enjoys a consistent stream of rental income. The average lease term until renewal is just under 10 years, providing the real estate investment trust with significant flexibility over the next decade, regardless of economic conditions.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) stands out among buy-and-hold stocks in that it is attractive to a range of investment strategies and investor preferences, from AI enthusiasts and healthcare proponents to those seeking reliable dividend income.\n\nMedtronic is poised to lead the healthcare AI revolution. Its long-standing partnership with AI powerhouse Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is pioneering the development of AI-integrated medical hardware. Nvidia\u2019s healthcare vice president, Kim Powell, highlighted the significance of this collaboration, stating that it will \u201caccelerate AI innovation by enabling a software-defined business model, with the goal of improving clinical decision-making, reducing medical variability, and driving better patient outcomes.\u201d Given Nvidia\u2019s industry dominance and history of king-making, Medtronic stands to gain significantly from this partnership.\n\nMoreover, Medtronic is positioned to benefit from the long-term growth of the medical device industry, which is expected to reach $795 billion by 2030, growing at a steady 5.2% compound annual growth rate since 2015. Medtronic holds one of the largest market shares in this industry, second only to diversified firms like McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) that also sell pharmaceuticals.\n\nFor value investors, Medtronic is an attractive option among buy-and-hold stocks. The company boasts a sustainable price-to-book ratio of 1.9x and offers a solid total yield of 5.3%, making it a reliable choice for those looking to build a resilient portfolio.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf any growth stock in today\u2019s crowded, overvalued landscape can be classified as a player among buy and hold stocks, it\u2019s Crowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD). Businesses face many challenges today and grapple with geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, and supply chain disruptions.\n\nDespite these issues, cyber threats remain the top global risk for most business owners, both small and large. Concerns about cyber threats, data breaches, digital infrastructure vulnerabilities, and ransomware attempts are at the forefront of their minds.\n\nCrowdstrike, a leading cybersecurity stock, is positioned to address these growing threats as technological advancements demand more robust security solutions. The company already serves a diverse clientele, including government agencies, corporations, small businesses, and educational institutions.\n\nImpressively, Crowdstrike\u2019s revenue has significantly increased over the past five quarters, with the last four marking its first consecutive profitable periods. These incremental and successive income boosts, particularly in today\u2019s economic climate, suggest a promising future for Crowdstrike as it continues to lead in digital security and protection.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a stock that demands attention. Known for its cutting-edge data analytics and AI-driven solutions, Palantir carved out a niche in both the public and private sectors. Government agencies, commercial enterprises, and non-profit organizations leverage its platforms, Palantir Gotham and Palantir Foundry, to make sense of complex data and drive informed decision-making.\n\nDespite some volatility in its stock price, Palantir\u2019s growth potential remains strong and remarkably resilient this year, consistently trading in the $25 range. The company keeps nailing high-profile contracts, such as its recent multi-million dollar deals with the U.S. Department of Defense and cutting-edge space companies. These contracts provide steady revenue streams and reinforce Palantir\u2019s reputation as a trusted partner in the data analytics space.\n\nPalantir is an easy pick among buy-and-hold stocks for investors interested in capturing AI and the big data sector\u2019s continued potential. Its continuous innovation, expanding client base, and strategic positioning make it a standout player poised for long-term growth.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf you had to guess the best-performing stock of the past few decades, you\u2019d likely think of a big-name tech firm or one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks. However, Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) takes the crown, delivering an astounding 31% annualized return since 1998. In comparison, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the second-best performer, achieved a \u201cmere\u201d 28% annual gain.\n\nWhile Monster still has some growth potential, the \u201cnext big thing\u201d in beverage stocks is undoubtedly Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH). A January downgrade from Bank of America temporarily pushed share prices down, dropping 3% since then, but that temporary dip presents a prime entry point for investors. Celsius is not resting on its laurels; the company is aggressively expanding into new markets, including Canada, the UK, and Ireland.\n\nBank of America\u2019s concerns about flatlining market share in the saturated U.S. market may have merit, but Celsius\u2019 international growth strategy offers a renewed pathway for rapid expansion. With these new avenues, Celsius is well-positioned to continue its impressive growth trajectory.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is having a tough year amid lithium spot pricing concerns and a string of analyst downgrades. However, these short-term setbacks shouldn\u2019t deter you from considering this stock for long-term gains. The downgrades were mainly influenced by temporary fluctuations in electric vehicle demand, which overlook Albemarle\u2019s strong long-term potential.\n\nAlbemarle specializes in lithium production, and the future demand for lithium looks exceptionally bright. Projections show that by 2030, lithium demand will exceed supply by 500,000 tons annually. These promising growth prospects suggest that concerns about the viability of lithium producers are overblown and that Albemarle\u2019s recent downturn doesn\u2019t reflect its long-term potential.\n\nAlbemarle\u2019s strategic positioning makes it stand out, especially considering the massive lithium demand sector. By 2025, experts predict China will account for nearly half of the global lithium demand. Albemarle\u2019s refineries are geographically close to Chinese manufacturing facilities, enabling efficient supply chains. This proximity positions Albemarle as a leading lithium producer ready to meet China\u2019s increasing demand for this essential resource, making it an excellent choice for investors looking to capitalize on sustainable and green energy transitions.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Best AI Stocks for the Second Half of 2024. Since Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) ranks 7th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWedbush Securities in a fresh note said mega-cap tech stocks have a 15% upside in the second half of 2024, driven by AI. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has been beating the AI drum and thinks the AI \u201cparty\u201d is just getting started, wrote that the $4 trillion AI arms race is between major tech players and GPU chips have become the new oil or gold in the tech industry.\n\nIves wrote that he thinks NASDAQ will have another strong second half of the year.\n\n\u201cTech stocks will be up 15% the rest of 2024 in our view with tech fundamentals set to accelerate as AI use cases materially expand.\u201d\n\nWhile Ives continues to see the major tech stocks leading the AI market, he thinks the AI-led rally can broaden out to tech companies who have strong \u201cinstalled\u201d bases which can actually use generative AI applications and models.\n\nLast month, while talking to CNBC, Ives said that the tech bull market is going to last for at least two more years. When asked what could be the threat to this bull run, Ives said that China could be a threat amid a possibility of \u201ctech cold war\u201d but he thinks that is a \u201ccontained threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt started off with the semis, but now it\u2019s started to happen is, the demand and the use cases\u201d are expanding to other companies. Ives called the AI boom the \u201cfourth industrial revolution.\u201d\n\nWe picked top AI stocks from Wedbush\u2019s latest note. The firm named some of these stocks as the best picks for the second half of 2024 while called others \u201coversold\u201d tech stocks. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) Best AI Stock for the Second Half of 2024?\n\nCopyright: daviles / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 76\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWD)\u00a0is another cybersecurity stock Dan Ives of Wedbush believes is a good pick for the second half of 2024. Oppenheimer recently gave an Outperform rating to Crowdstrike Holdings Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWD)\u00a0shares based on technical analysis. CRWD\u2019s generative AI security platform Charlotte AI is seeing a lot of traction. In the June quarter the platform saw a whopping 90% POV close rate. During the quarter, Crowdstrike Holdings Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWD)\u00a0saw a dramatic surge in deals involving cloud, identity, or Falcon Next-Gen SIEM, more than doubling year-over-year. Management emphasized that customers are reaping substantial cost savings by adopting more modules, a development that bodes very well for Crowdstrike Holdings Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:CRWD)\u00a0top-line growth. The strategic expansion of its modules has also tapped into the burgeoning AI-related demand, driving higher adoption rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock\u2019s forward P/E is 97, much higher than the industry average of 24, but 76% lower than the company\u2019s five-year average. Wall Street expects revenue of Crowdstrike Holdings Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:CRWD)\u00a0to grow 26% next year and earnings by 23%. Average analyst price target for the stock is $401, which presents just 3% upside potential from the current levels.\n\nTimesSquare Capital U.S. Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe high demand for cybersecurity systems is unlikely to abate, which benefited\u00a0CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD). The company\u2019s expansion beyond endpoint security to offering security on all cloud workloads, along with its growing product suite in areas such as identity and security information & event management, is driving strong demand for its platform among customers amidst a very active cyberthreat environment. That lifted its shares by 25% this quarter, and we trimmed our position.\u201d\n\nOverall, Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) ranks 7th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks for the Second Half of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "In an era where digital threats loom large, the demand for smart cybersecurity stocks has never been this high.\n\nInvestors are paying attention, as according to Fortune Business Insights, the global market for cybersecurity services and products was valued at $172.32 billion last year and is expected to skyrocket to $424.97 billion by 2030. Ongoing advances in digitalization and artificial intelligence (AI) drive this growth, making the sector highly promising for investment.\n\nMoreover, the financial impacts of data breaches can be severe, implementing robust security solutions imperative. Companies that provide essential security for critical applications are growing rapidly and are poised to further ascend in market stature.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn such circumstances, these three cybersecurity stocks offer excellent opportunities for investors eager to capitalize on the sector\u2019s momentum. These companies have set themselves apart by delivering innovative security solutions and strong market performance, establishing themselves as key players in the cybersecurity field.\n\nCybersecurity Stocks: Zscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nZscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) excels in the cybersecurity industry with its outstanding cloud-based solutions, which provide powerful protection for users, apps, and data regardless of location. The Zero Trust Exchange platform is a key component of its products, connecting users directly to apps and redefining safe network access.\n\nSpicing up the intensity, Zscaler has acquired Avalor and Airgap Networks, pushing the frontiers of AI-driven Zero Trust Security Access Service Edge (SASE). It didn\u2019t stop there, though, as it recently announced a partnership with the AI chip maker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). This alliance will bring Nvidia\u2019s advanced Gen AI technology into Zscaler\u2019s operations, notably enhancing the Zscaler Copilot platform. The improved Copilot will proactively identify and mitigate cyber risks, as well as optimize IT and network operations with greater speed and precision.\n\nMoreover, Zscaler had a superb third-quarter of 2024, with a remarkable 32% bump in revenue to $553.2 million, while its earnings-per-share (EPS) smashed estimates by 23 cents.\n\nThese achievements underscore the company\u2019s rapidly escalating business, making it a smart choice for investors.\n\nOkta (OKTA) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Okta (OKTA) logo.\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nOkta (NASDAQ:OKTA)has truly made its mark in cybersecurity, offering top-notch identity management solutions and smartly using AI to combat AI-driven threats. In October 2023, the company launched Identity Threat Protection, a new product for Okta Workforce Identity Cloud powered by Okta AI. This program goes beyond the initial user login, continually analyzing risk during active sessions and automatically responding to threats throughout the network, therefore dynamically improving security.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Okta\u2019s recent acquisition of Spera Security has strengthened its technological edge, significantly enhancing its Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) capabilities and amplifying threat visibility across Identity Providers, SaaS, and infrastructure applications.\n\nContinuing its streak of excellence, Okta has outperformed estimates for 16 consecutive quarters. In Q1 of 2025, it ramped up revenue by 19.1% to $617 million, surpassing expectations by $12.5 million, and impressively increased its non-GAAP operating income by a staggering 270% to $133 million.\n\nAs for what lies ahead, there\u2019s a lot of optimism for a solid Q2, with operating margins projected between 19% and 20%.

It noticed a big spike in Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks last year, reflecting a growing threat landscape. To tackle this, it has beefed up its DDoS mitigation capabilities, ensuring robust protection for its clients against increasingly sophisticated threats.\n\nOn top of that, Cloudflare has introduced a dedicated Firewall for AI, protecting large language models with features like rate limiting and data detection. This initiative is crucial as AI adoption expands, securing these models from potential vulnerabilities.\n\nIn addition to these breakthroughs, Cloudflare\u2019s partnership with CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) marks a pivotal move in cybersecurity. They\u2019re revolutionizing cybersecurity efficiency by integrating Zero Trust security with AI-powered defenses through a unified API.\n\nFinancially, Cloudflare kicked off the year strong, posting a 30% YOY revenue jump to $378.6 million in Q1.

        "title": "3 Overvalued Tech Stocks Heading for a Fall",
        "content": "When it comes to stocks, valuation matters.\n\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio measures a company\u2019s share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS). The P/E ratio helps to determine if a stock is expensive, or trading at a high multiple, relative to its peers or the overall market. Currently, the average P/E ratio among stocks listed on the benchmark S&P 500 index is near 25 times future earnings estimates.\n\nDuring the 2022 bear market, the average P/E ratio among U.S. stocks was closer to 17 times earnings. Stocks trading at extremely high multiples are often doing so because investors are banking on big future growth at the company, or because hype surrounding a stock is leading to a lot of people buying it. Value investors rigorously scrutinize valuations before buying a stock. Warren Buffett famously won\u2019t buy a stock that has a P/E ratio above 15.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, let\u2019s explore three overvalued tech stocks heading for a fall. Don\u2019t slip up on them.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) looks pricey trading at 727 times future earnings estimates. In the last 12 months, CRWD stock has risen 167%, including a 57% year-to-date (YTD) gain. The sharp move higher has given CrowdStrike stock a lofty valuation. The high P/E multiple was one of the reasons the stock was recently downgraded by analysts at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR).\n\nPiper Sandler lowered its rating on CRWD stock to a hold equivalent neutral from an overweight buy equivalent rating previously. The analysts maintained their price target on the stock of $400. Also, Piper Sandler noted that CrowdStrike stock has few catalysts working in its favor currently. And, the risk/reward for the shares has become less favorable after the big move higher over the past year.\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) looks woefully overpriced right now trading at 443 times future earnings approximations. The company, whose software is used in cloud-computing, has seen its share price rise only about 34% in the last 12 months. However, the move has still pushed shares of the company, which went public in 2019, up to extreme heights relative to its earnings outlook.\n\nInvestors are clearly betting on big future growth at Datadog, which builds cloud monitoring and security products that work with Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other cloud platforms. Analysts are less convinced and have also been downgrading this stock. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) lowered its rating on DDOG stock to neutral from buy, dropping its price target to $105 from $123.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

AMD stock, which has risen 43% in the last 12 months, is more expensive than rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The latter\u2019s share price is up 203% over the last year but currently trades at a P/E ratio of 75. Some analysts speculate that the valuation is holding back AMD stock.\n\nSince hitting a 52-week high in March of this year, AMD stock has declined nearly 30%. Lackluster financial results are part of the reason. But so too is the premium at which the stock has been trading based largely on hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). In June, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) downgraded AMD stock to a hold equivalent equal weight rating from a buy equivalent overweight rating. The investment bank held its price target on AMD stock at $176.\n\nIn their downgrade, the analysts cited Nvidia as a superior option in the semiconductor space that\u2019s available at a cheaper multiple than AMD.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

        "title": "Is CrowdStrike Holdings a Buy?",
        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) has been one of the market's big winners -- shares are up over 165% in the past 12 months -- and it has arguably become the hottest name in the fast-growing cybersecurity space.\n\nIt's not just hype, though: CrowdStrike is generating profitable, high-speed growth and establishing competitive advantages quarter by quarter. But investors must be careful not to fly too close to the sun. The company may seem destined for greatness, but it's now fair to question how much of that is priced into shares already.\n\nSo is CrowdStrike a buy? Here's what you need to know.\n\nDurable double-digit growth ahead\n\nCrowdStrike could be a shoo-in for years of double-digit growth. The company's cloud-based cybersecurity platform uses cutting-edge technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to detect and respond to breaches. Its products are miles ahead of decades-old antivirus technology, which has existed since the personal computer's early days and predates modern technologies like the cloud.\n\nAdditionally, the company has expanded beyond endpoint security to increasingly become a do-it-all security platform that can widely serve a customer's broader security needs. This gives CrowdStrike multiple ways to grow:\n\nTake share in existing markets. Cross-sell products to existing users. Continually launch new products to grow its addressable market.\n\nCrowdStrike generated $3.3 billion of trailing-12-month revenue with the latest quarter's top line growing 33% year over year: CRWD Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nThere is also a growing demand for cybersecurity. Experts expect the global industry to grow at a 12% annualized pace through 2030. CrowdStrike's growth will slow as its business gets bigger, but it still seems poised for many years of double-digit growth.\n\nBuilding a moat right now\n\nGrowing companies don't roll out of bed with a competitive moat. Instead, they must build it over time.\n\nHow is CrowdStrike building its moat? Platform expansion.\n\nCrowdStrike's endpoint security product is great, but a single offering generally doesn't create a moat. In this case, SentinelOne offers a comparable endpoint product too. Additionally, customers typically have a wide variety of security needs.\n\nSo, CrowdStrike has launched many other product modules to meet more needs, both organically and via acquisitions. Today, 28% of CrowdStrike's customers have adopted seven or more of its modules. The more cybersecurity needs CrowdStrike's platform handles for a customer, the harder it becomes to switch to a different provider.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's ability to expand its platform and cross-sell products is key to its growing competitive moat.\n\nIs CrowdStrike a buy?\n\nEven as CrowdStrike rapidly expands its reach, it's growing more profitable as well. Fiscal 2025 Q1 net income of $42.8 million surged from the year-ago period. Free cash flow also rose 42% during the quarter to $322.5 million.\n\nYet the company could still be in its early innings. Management believes its addressable market will grow to $225 billion by 2028, meaning CrowdStrike is only capturing a low-single-digit share of that opportunity.\n\nThat makes the stock a no-brainer buy, right? Well, not quite. There is a catch. CRWD PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe stock trades at more than 96 times forward earnings estimates. That's a steep price, even for a company executing at a high level like CrowdStrike. And it's still steep when taking into account the 40% annual earnings growth analysts expect from the company over the next three to five years.\n\nAfter climbing over 165% in the past year, the stock could pull back in the near future. The market's sky-high expectations mean even the smallest sign of weakness could send the stock tumbling, and the margin of safety is razor-thin.\n\nWith that in mind, anyone buying shares of CrowdStrike today must be patient and approach this stock with a long-term mindset.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Soaring Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Aren't Just Hype",
        "content": "It seems that all modern technological innovations undergo a hype cycle of sorts. The most famous is the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Nasdaq more than doubled from the beginning of 1997 through the March 2000 zenith. Many think an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble is forming now; many others disagree. One of the key differences between companies now and those during the dot-com bubble is profitability.\n\nWhile many tech companies back then had little sales and no profits, dozens of companies in the AI industry today are cash-flow positive, have soaring revenue, or are highly profitable -- not just hyped. This is a critical distinction that can help guide your investment strategy. Here are two companies that fit this mold.\n\nMicron Technology\n\nIf there is one thing that AI needs, it is data, and this data needs memory -- tons of it. Micron(NASDAQ: MU) is a global leader in providing DRAM (dynamic random access memory) and NAND (flash memory), which are used in smartphones, PCs, memory cards, data centers, etc. After a rough fiscal 2023, Micron is back in a major way.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, Micron battled geopolitical problems that hampered Chinese sales and a market where its products were not in demand due to oversupply. In other words, many of its customers were using existing inventory rather than purchasing more from Micron. Sales fell from $31 billion in fiscal 2022 to $16 billion in fiscal 2023. The industry is cyclical; in 2023, it was down, but now things are looking up.\n\nAI powers two trends that will be tailwinds for Micron. First, hundreds of data centers are coming online every year, and this trend is expected to continue for many years. Micron's management says that its HBM (high-bandwidth memory) sales will reach hundreds of millions this fiscal year and \"multiple billions\" next fiscal year. Next, AI will increase demand for upgrading PCs and smartphones, and these AI-ready systems will require more memory, a direct benefit to Micron.\n\nMicron reported $6.8 billion in revenue in the third quarter of fiscal-year 2024, an 81% increase over the prior year and a significant margin improvement due to high demand. Operating income improved year over year from a loss of $1.8 billion to a profit of $719 million.\n\nThe stock's valuation is out of whack due to its profitability last year and incremental recovery this year. This year's average analyst earnings-per-share (EPS) expectations are just $1.23, giving Micron a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio over 100 at the current price; however, this isn't the whole story. As shown below, analysts predict a massive EPS jump next year to $9.48, which would make the P/E only 14.\n\nStory continues MU PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe low valuation based on fiscal 2025 estimates and significant tailwinds make Micron a solid long-term investment.\n\nCrowdStrike\n\nCybersecurity is always a priority for executives because the costs of breaches, in terms of direct costs, downtime, recovery, etc., can be immense. Most successful breaches occur through endpoints, so companies clamor for protection from AI-powered protection like CrowdStrike's (NASDAQ: CRWD) Falcon platform.\n\nFalcon is entirely cloud-based and modular, so companies can add features as needed. Selling additional modules is part of CrowdStrike's land-and-expand sales strategy, which works well. As of Q1 FY25, 65% of customers used at least five modules, and 28% used seven or more.\n\nThe demand for endpoint protection drives incredible growth for CrowdStrike's sales and free cash flow, as shown below. CRWD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe incredible rise in sales and nearly 32% free-cash-flow margin over the last 12 months show why investors are buying the stock hand over fist. The stock is up 50% so far in 2024 and 500% over the past five years. However, the epic rise has pushed the stock's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio extremely high.\n\nCrowdStrike's P/S ratio now stands near 29, higher than fellow high-growth software company Palantir and cybersecurity companies like Palo Alto Networks and Zscaler: CRWD PS Ratio Chart\n\nCRWD PS Ratio data by YCharts\n\nInvestors should be cautious about buying CrowdStrike because of its valuation; however, the company's results are spectacular, and it has a tremendous future.\n\nThe artificial intelligence boom is in full swing, and many companies are reaping the rewards.

        "title": "3 Overvalued Stocks Set for a Brutal Reality Check",
        "content": "The tech sector witnessed record highs on Tuesday, driven by continued interest in companies focused on artificial intelligence (AI). However, there are concerns about overvalued stocks as investors show exuberance around certain companies\u2019 prospects.\n\nRecent equity index gains appear to stem primarily from a small number of large firms. Even typically bullish analysts covering the tech industry believe enthusiasm has slightly surpassed rational expectations, suggesting a correction is on the line.\r\n\r\nAnalysts conclude that share prices of certain stocks from various sectors have exceeded earnings growth. Some shares have rocketed to unsustainable levels, warranting short-term declines. However, others face potential longer-term downside should fundamentals fail to justify high prices.\n\nInvestors tend to speculate on tech stocks that are not currently worthwhile but promising long-term. Several technology companies in 2024 have seen share prices rising faster than earnings.\r\n\r\nThe following three overvalued stocks could face a sobering reality should earnings fail to justify soaring share valuations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe data analytics and AI firm Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) continues to drive innovation in its industry. Its revenue grew 21% over the last year, reaching solid earnings levels for a large firm. The company also recently became profitable, with EBITDA increasing 37%. Such results would satisfy most industrial companies.\r\n\r\nHowever, Palantir\u2019s share price has risen 68% over the same period, resulting in an overvalued price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 215.3x. This ratio far exceeds what most investors find reasonable. PLTR stock price jumped when the company expanded into AI over a year ago. Yet, Palantir\u2019s earnings have not kept pace with the rising share price, leaving the company with triple-digit P/E ratios for almost a year.\n\nAnalysts are concerned about Palantir and believe it is one of the overvalued stocks set for a brutal reality check. Many recommend selling PLTR, with an average price target 16% below the current share price. Notably, PLTR stock recently reversed after reaching levels near its 52-week high.\n\nARM Holdings (ARM) The Arm logo seen at semiconductor and software design company Arm Holdings' US Headquarters in San Jose, California. ARM IPO\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe U.K.-based chip designer ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) has received significant attention since its initial public offering (IPO) last year. ARM stock price has risen almost 200% since last September, a noteworthy performance given that the company designs but does not manufacture chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile ARM benefits from the hype around AI, it only recently established its own chip division and plans to enter the market next year. Currently, it relies on licensing and royalty fees from expanded server demand to support AI growth, fueling 47% revenue growth over the past year. However, it expects revenue growth to slow to approximately 22% for the next year, with similar earnings growth.\r\n\r\nDespite tempting financials, ARM\u2019s share price has risen much faster than earnings, leading to a P/E ratio of 582.7x. This positions it among the highest of overvalued stocks globally. On average, analysts expect ARM stock to decline to around $125.62, representing a potential downside of over 25% from current levels.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), a cyber security company that protects cloud computing and servers, is the last pick on this list of overvalued stocks to consider letting go. It would naturally do well as AI drives demand for digital storage and decentralized processing.\n\nThe company saw its annual recurring revenue (ARR) grow by 33% over the last year. It delivered record cash flow generation and a 63% increase in its adjusted EPS to $0.93 per share. However, analysts have concluded that the fast 163% growth in CRWD stock prices over the last year has caused the stock to become overvalued, pushing its P/E ratio to 717x.\r\n\r\nThis overvaluation is one reason Piper Sandler\u2019s analyst downgraded the company\u2019s outlook. While CrowdStrike continues to see strong growth, it faces increased competition from Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) and Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW). There is also growing concern that market sentiment could turn at any moment and take the overvalued stock back to an industry-standard valuation of 48x.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Earnings per share was $4.71, up from $2.20 per share in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nMeta is also deeply involved with artificial intelligence with Meta AI, a large language model that can do everything from creating images and animated custom GIFs to suggest a dinner menu based on what ingredients you have on hand.\n\nMeta\u2019s Q2 earnings report is slated for July 31. If it continues to grow revenue and daily average users, the stock will have a massive summer.\n\nMETA stock is up 44% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle restaurant store exterior sign and storefront. CMG stock\n\nSource: Robert V Schwemmer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is an amazing fast-casual restaurant stock. The company perfectly positioned itself as an alternative to a slew of burger joints by offering custom-made burritos and burrito bowls consisting of fresh ingredients \u2013 nothing is ever frozen.\n\nThat\u2019s why Chipotle grew to over 3,400 locations. And unlike many other chains, Chipotle doesn\u2019t sell franchises. All of its locations are owned and operated by the company, so Chipotle can do a better job in maintaining quality and standards.\n\nAnd if you thought Chipotle stock was too expensive to buy without fractional shares, think again. The company in late June executed a 50-for-1 stock split so shares of CMG stock are just over $60.\n\nThat makes them far more accessible to retail investors and it\u2019s much easier to make options trades with CMG stock as well.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $2.7 billion, up 14.1% from a year ago. Comparable restaurant sales were up 7% and operating margins rose from 15.5% to 16.3%.\n\nChipotle stock is up 34% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

And it also has a customer-friendly business model because its servers are like building blocks \u2013 parts can be easily swapped out and upgraded rather than a customer replacing the entire thing.\n\nEarnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2024 included sales of $3.85 billion, up from $1.28 billion a year ago. Income was $402 million and $6.56 per share versus $86 million and $1.53 per share last year.\n\nSMCI stock is down from all-time highs hit in March, but the stock still gained 197% in 2024 and maintains its \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith more of our business, banking and personal information on computers these days, there\u2019s much more of a need for companies like CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD).\n\nCrowdStrike is a computer security company that operates a cloud-native platform that provides endpoint protection, cloud workloads, identity and data.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform is powered by AI and machine learning to respond to and stop threats in real time. The company also sells modules, which are extensions that customers can add to customize their platforms and increase protection.\n\nModules include endpoint security, data security, IT operations, threat intelligence and more.\n\nCrowdStrike says 65% of its customers purchase and use at least five modules, making it a lucrative business model.\n\nRevenue for the company\u2019s first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $921 million, up 33% from a year ago. Subscription revenue was $872.2 million, up 34% from the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nCRWD stock is up 51% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the king of streaming services, ranking No. 1 as the biggest paid-for streaming company on the planet (it trails only YouTube, which is free to watch and ad-free with a premium subscription).\n\nNetflix currently has 269.6 million paid subscribers \u2013 a number that increased dramatically last year when the company dumped its longtime password-sharing program and began charging customers an $8 surcharge to grant access to an account outside of the household.\n\nThe decision was controversial with customers, but wildly effective. Paid memberships are up from 232.6 million a year ago because people find value in Netflix\u2019s content.\n\nRevenue of $9.3 billion in the first quarter was up 14.8% from a year ago, and Netflix forecast additional growth to $9.49 billion when it reports Q2 earnings in mid-July.\n\nNFLX stock is up 40% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (WSM) Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mall\n\nSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) proves that you don\u2019t have to be a tech company to be an A-rated stock.\n\nThe California-based company sells kitchenware and home furnishings, operating under the brands that include Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn and West Elm.\n\nIn addition to retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K., Williams-Sonoma franchises brands to third parties that operate in the Middle East, Mexico and the Philippines.\n\nThe company is also in the process of a 2-for-1 stock split. Shareholders as of June 27 will receive the split through a stock dividend that will be issued on July 8; shares will then start trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 9.\n\nBut if you missed the split, there\u2019s still plenty of reasons to have WSM stock. The company saw revenues drop in the first quarter to $1.66 billion from $1.75 billion a year ago.\n\nBut it was also more efficient, with profits of $802 million up from $675 million; net earnings of $265.6 million versus $156.5 million a year ago, and earnings per share of $4.07 versus $2.35 in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nWSM stock is up 39% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had LONG position(s) in NVDA, SMCI and CRWD.\u00a0Louis Navellier did not have (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had a LONG position in NVDA.

        "title": "3 Under-the-Radar Tech Stocks With Millionaire-Maker Upside",
        "content": "There are more than 3,500 publicly listed companies in the U.S. today. Yet a handful of stocks get all the attention from the media, analysts and investors. These tend to be the mega-cap tech stocks that dominate the market and are responsible for the majority of its gains and losses. Attention tends to go to companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) because they have so much influence over the market\u2019s direction instead of some under-the-radar tech stocks.\n\nWhile it makes sense that the most influential stocks should get most of the attention, it also means many great under-the-radar tech stocks. This is disappointing as many of these neglected stocks are quietly rising and beating the returns seen in the broader market. Spotting these hidden gems can add big gains to a portfolio.\n\nHere are three under-the-radar tech stocks with millionaire-maker upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) doesn\u2019t get nearly as much attention as it deserves. Companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) use the microchip-equipment maker\u2019s components. Yet the company and its stock receive only a fraction of the media attention given to its customers. This is largely due to Applied Materials being a going concern since 1967 and being viewed as Silicon Valley\u2019s founding father.\n\nSome of Applied Materials\u2019 equipment is so old that it is housed at the Smithsonian Museum. Regardless of its age, Applied Materials is still posting strong financial results, and its stock is responding. For its fiscal second quarter, Applied Materials most recently announced EPS of $2.09, which was ahead of analyst consensus estimates that called for a profit of $1.99 a share. Revenue totaled $6.65 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $6.54 billion.\n\nThe strong results and bullish forward guidance continue to send AMAT stock higher. In the last 12 months, Applied Materials\u2019 share price has risen 67%.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor an under-the-radar cybersecurity stock, look to Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). The company\u2019s stock is up 18% this year, but it badly trails the gains seen in its competitors, such as CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), whose share price has gained 57%. The big problem at Palo Alto Networks is that the company has missed Wall Street forecasts on several occasions.\n\nMost recently, Palo Alto Networks reported quarterly billings that missed analyst estimates, sending its stock down nearly 10%. For the company\u2019s fiscal third quarter, billings came in at $2.33 billion, missing analysts\u2019 average estimate of $2.34 billion. U.S. Analysts see the disappointing billing figure as a sign of reduced corporate spending on cybersecurity solutions, creating headwinds.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the near-term challenges, 38 Wall Street analysts who cover the company rate Palo Alto Networks\u2019 stock a \u201cstrong buy\u201d and expect future gains.\n\nAnalog Devices (ADI)\n\nSource: sdecoret / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Applied Materials, Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is a semiconductor company whose stock flies under the radar of most investors but nevertheless outperforms. So far, in 2024, ADI stock is up nearly 20%. In the last five years, the share price has more than doubled. Also, like Applied Materials, Analog Devices continues to post strong quarterly prints that underpin its share price.\n\nIn May of this year, Analog Devices announced EPS of $1.40 for its fiscal second quarter, beating analysts\u2019 consensus forecast of $1.26. Revenue came in at $2.16 billion, beating expectations for $2.11 billion. The company, which makes semiconductors used in data conversion and signal processing, attributed the strong results to rising orders and demand for its products, particularly in the automotive and industrial sectors.\n\nLooking ahead, Analog Devices raised its forecast for the year\u2019s second quarter, saying it expects revenue of $2.27 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Analysts had forecast $2.16 billion in fiscal third-quarter sales. ADI stock also pays a quarterly dividend of 92 cents, giving it a yield of 1.60%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in AMAT and NVDA. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "title": "7 Cutting-Edge Tech Stocks to Supercharge Your Profits",
        "content": "Fundamentally, the bullish narrative for targeting cutting-edge tech stocks is rather straightforward. Outside of extraordinary circumstances, the innovation ecosystem always attempts to push society forward. Therefore, should you pick viable enterprises, you stand a better chance of accruing significant profits over the long run.\n\nEssentially, the concept undergirding cutting-edge tech stocks is permanently relevant. That doesn\u2019t mean that every idea selected from the broad tech umbrella will perform well. There are zero guarantees in the market and even robust and celebrated enterprises can always fail. That said, the unique backdrop of the current juncture makes individual innovators compelling.\n\nWith the advancement of artificial intelligence and related innovations, a surge of demand has entered the tech environment. Further, the resounding upside of names like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have galvanized support among investors. Now, the focus has shifted toward alternative entities that can deliver the goods. On that note, below are cutting-edge tech stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the biggest names among cutting-edge tech stocks, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plays a key role in multiple arenas. A significant money maker is the company\u2019s Azure platform, which is a leader in cloud-computing services. Further, Microsoft has invested heavily in AI, integrating digital intelligence across its products. It\u2019s also a huge name in the gig economy thanks to its Office 365 suite of business programs.\n\nWhat makes MSFT a particularly powerful player among cutting-edge tech stocks is predictability. Between the second quarter of 2023 and Q1 2024, the company\u2019s average earnings per share hit $2.82. This print translated to an average earnings surprise of 7%. Notably, it beat every bottom-line target for each of the past four quarters.\n\nDuring the trailing 12 months (TTM), Microsoft posted net income of $86.18 billion or $11.53 per share. Revenue reached $236.58 billion. For fiscal 2024, experts anticipate over 20% expansion in EPS to $11.80. On the top line, they\u2019re targeting 15.6% growth to sales of $244.92 billion.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the top semiconductor manufacturing specialists, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) focuses on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. These pieces of equipment are crucial for developing the most advanced computer chips. Essentially, the underlying technology enables operators to print intricate patterns on silicon wafers. Plus, ASML is unique \u2013 it\u2019s a one-of-a-kind enterprise, making it one of the top cutting-edge tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs with Microsoft, ASML represents a predictable business. That\u2019s no surprise given its unique nature. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average EPS of $4.85. This print translated into an average earnings surprise of 8.2%. The company beat bottom-line targets in each of the past four quarters.\n\nDuring the TTM period, ASML posted net income of $7.11 billion or $19.25 per share. Revenue during the cycle hit $26.1 billion. For fiscal 2024, analysts see mixed results, anticipating a slight dip in EPS and a very modest rise in revenue. However, fiscal 2025 could see a 56.5% leap in EPS to $32.21. Sales could soar 32.4% to hit $39.57 billion.\n\nHoneywell (HON) top Tech stocks to watch : Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing. tech stocks\n\nSource: Peshkova / Shutterstock\n\nWhile I wouldn\u2019t technically call Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) a pure-play example of cutting-edge tech stocks, the industrial conglomerate does feature a building controls business unit. Under this unit, Honeywell offers charging solutions for electric vehicles. Specifically, it markets its services to commercial real-estate operators looking to integrated EV charging to their properties.\n\nThat\u2019s compelling due to recent deals in the EV space. Basically, more automakers are focusing on securing demand from middle-income customers as opposed to affluent buyers. Well, long story short, a direct correlation exists between income and homeownership. And that means modest-income buyers will likely require public charging solutions. That\u2019s a huge plus for HON stock over the long run.\n\nPlus, Honeywell is a consistent player, beating its bottom-line targets in the past four quarters. Its average earnings surprise came out to 2.85%. For fiscal 2024, covering experts are looking for EPS to expand by 12.2% to reach $10.28. On the top line, they anticipate sales to rise by 5.6% to hit $38.7 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s not much growth but Honeywell also offers a forward yield of 2.02%.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) An image of a white, grey, and orange sign with the \"Intuitive Surgical\" logo and number \"1020\" on a patch of grass in front of a white, grey, and orange building on a sunny day.\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother name that\u2019s not quite a pure-play candidate for cutting-edge tech stocks, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) nevertheless deserves some consideration. Yes, it\u2019s more aligned with the healthcare sector. Intuitive develops and manufactures robotic products for minimally invasive surgeries. Ultimately, the underlying innovation should help improve patient outcomes. And that down the line benefits the broader economy.\n\nIndeed, society suffers when individuals \u2013 especially highly skilled and educated workers \u2013 must exit the assembly line (for lack of a better phrase) to take care of their health needs. So, minimizing the downtime is beneficial for the patient and society\u2019s bottom line. It\u2019s no surprise that Intuitive has been a consistent performer. In the past four quarters, its average EPS came out to nearly $1.50.\n\nFor the above print, the average earnings surprise was 6.2%. In the TTM period, Intuitive posted net income of $1.99 billion or $5.52 per share. Revenue reached $7.32 billion. For fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for 10% EPS expansion to $6.29. On the top line, sales could hit $8.02 billion, up 12.6% from last year.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top names in cybersecurity, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is vital to the wider economy. That\u2019s an easy statement to make because so much of business is conducted online and through cloud networks. It\u2019s critical to provide next-generation endpoint protection, which is CrowdStrike\u2019s specialty. It also offers threat intelligence and proactive threat hunting.\n\nWhile enterprises may be looking for costs to cut, cybersecurity may survive the budgeting axe. That\u2019s because an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, especially in the digital age. Not surprisingly, CrowdStrike has been a stellar performer over the past four quarters, generating an average EPS of 86 cents. This print translated to an earnings surprise of 15.83%.\n\nIn the TTM period, the cybersecurity specialist posted net income of $131.66 million or 54 cents per share. Revenue reached $3.28 billion. For the current fiscal year, experts are seeking 29.4% growth in EPS to $4. On the top line, sales may see a 30.8% boost to $4 billion. It\u2019s easily one of the cutting-edge tech stocks to consider.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nMoving over to the riskier side of cutting-edge tech stocks, C3.ai (NYSE:AI) specializes in enterprise-level AI. It develops software applications for multiple industries along with government agencies. One of its main attributes is that it provides mechanisms for predictive maintenance. That can be especially crucial for both civilian and military uses, impacting safety and operational integrity.\n\nFurther, what makes C3.ai appealing to speculators is that the underlying innovation enables practical uses of AI to foster productivity. Still, it\u2019s a risky idea, with shares in red ink over a 52-week basis. Further, the company isn\u2019t profitable, producing a loss per share of 11.5 cents in the past four quarters. That said, the quarterly surprise during this period came out to just under 48%.\n\nDuring the TTM period, C3.ai posted a net loss of $279.7 million or $2.34 per share in the red. Revenue in the cycle reached $310.58 million. For the current fiscal year, analysts believe the loss per share may unfavorably widen by nearly 15% to 54 cents. However, sales could see a 23.4% jump to $383.39 million.\n\nVeritone (VERI) AI stocks to buy now, Graphic of letters \"AI\" in bold font surrounded by circle of tech symbols in purple and blue against a dark background. ai stocks to buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Tex vector\n\nBased in Irvine, California, Veritone (NASDAQ:VERI) is an AI technology firm. Its main call to fame is its platform called aiWARE, which integrates AI solutions to process, transform and analyze audio, video and text data in real-time. In particular, media and entertainment agencies utilize Veritone\u2019s services for content creation, management and monetization.\n\nWith so much material moving to online platforms, Veritone could be able to carve out a powerful niche. However, the problem is volatility. After soaring to blistering heights in April this year, VERI stock has plunged badly. Therefore, it\u2019s undoubtedly a speculative entity. It\u2019s not profitable either, producing a loss per share of 23 cents over the past four quarters.\n\nIn the TTM period, Veritone incurred a net loss of $60.86 million or $1.63 per share. Revenue during the period reached $128.93 million. For fiscal 2024, experts do see a significant improvement in the loss per share to 35 cents. That\u2019s a far cry from $1.01 in the red. Also, revenue may pop 8.1% to hit $137.9 million.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Q1 Earnings Outperformers: Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS) And The Rest Of The Cybersecurity Stocks\n\nEarnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q1 now behind us, let\u2019s have a look at Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS) and its peers.\n\nCybersecurity continues to be one of the fastest-growing segments within software for good reason. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing rising cybersecurity risks. Businesses are accelerating adoption of cloud-based software, moving data and applications into the cloud to save costs while improving performance. This migration has opened them to a multitude of new threats, like employees accessing data via their smartphone while on an open network, or logging into a web-based interface from a laptop in a new location.\n\nThe 9 cybersecurity stocks we track reported a slower Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.4%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.5% below consensus. Stocks, especially growth stocks where cash flows further in the future are more important to the story, had a good end of 2023. But the beginning of 2024 has seen more volatile stock performance due to mixed inflation data, but cybersecurity stocks have shown resilience, with share prices up 5.1% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nVaronis (NASDAQ:VRNS)\n\nFounded by a duo of former Israeli Defense Forces cyber warfare engineers, Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS) offers software-as-service that helps customers protect data from cyber threats and gain visibility into how enterprise data is being used.\n\nVaronis reported revenues of $114 million, up 6.2% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with a solid beat of analysts' billings estimates but a decline in its gross margin.\n\nYaki Faitelson, Varonis CEO, said, \"Our first quarter results reflect the continued strong adoption of our SaaS platform, driven by the automated outcomes that customers receive and our recently introduced MDDR offering, which we believe is a game changer for our company.\" Varonis Total Revenue\n\nVaronis delivered the slowest revenue growth of the whole group.

It was a very strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' billings estimates and a solid beat of analysts' ARR (annual recurring revenue) estimates.

It was a weak quarter for the company, with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and decelerating customer growth.\n\nRapid7 had the weakest full-year guidance update in the group. The company lost -64 customers and ended up with a total of 11,462. The stock is down 6.4% since the results and currently trades at $42.9.\n\nRead our full analysis of Rapid7's results here.\n\nSentinelOne (NYSE:S)\n\nWith roots in the Israeli cyber intelligence community, SentinelOne (NYSE:S) provides software to help organizations efficiently detect, prevent, and investigate cyber attacks.\n\nSentinelOne reported revenues of $186.4 million, up 39.7% year on year, surpassing analysts' expectations by 2.9%.

        "content": "PayPal upgraded, Crowdstrike downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nSusquehanna upgraded PayPal (PYPL) to Positive from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $71. The firm cites valuation for the upgrade following the stock's significant recent decline. Seaport Research upgraded Bank of America(BAC) to Buy from Neutral with a $48 price target. The firm says recent management guidance implies turnover across the bank's loan book is improving, with potential further upside as cash flow hedges on commercial and industrial loans mature. Piper Sandler upgraded Atlassian (TEAM) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $225, up from $200. With the shares sliding to eight-times estimated 2025 revenue, Atlassian's risk/reward has turned favorable, the firm tells investors in a research note JPMorgan upgraded Principal Financial(PFG) to Neutral from Underweight with a price target of $96, up from $88. The upgrade is driven by the company's \"superior\" business mix, an expected improvement in asset management flows, and the stock's significant underperformance, the firm says. More bullish on the name, Raymond James upgraded Comerica (CMA) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $60 price target.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nPiper Sandler downgraded Crowdstrike (CRWD) to Neutral from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $400. The firm remains \"excited\" about the company next act, seeing \"many incremental growth opportunities,\" but believes the risk/reward on shares of Crowdstrike is less favorable at this time given the strong run. Seaport Research downgraded Goldman Sachs(GS) to Neutral from Buy with no price target, telling investors that the downgrade is primarily driven by valuation after a significant rally in the stock. Citi double downgraded Shoals Technologies(SHLS) to Sell from Buy with a price target of $5, down from $15, after analyzing potential outcomes ahead of the forthcoming initial determination of the company's patent infringement case against Voltage. The Commission Investigative Staff opinion on the case \"skews the odds meaningfully against\" Shoals, the firm tells investors in a research note. UBS downgraded Pure Storage(PSTG) to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $47, up from $44. The firm sees an unfavorable risk/reward for the shares given the company's slowing growth and declining market share. UBS downgraded Fiverr (FVRR) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $25, down from $37, after a different analyst at the firm assumed coverage of the name. UBS sees a more balanced risk/reward given more subdued revenue and gross merchandise volume growth in the near-term.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nRedburn Atlantic initiated coverage of GE Vernova(GEV) with a Neutral rating and $178 price target. The firm believes GE Vernova is fairly valued. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Waystar (WAY) with a Buy rating and $32 price target. The firm believes Waystar's \"comprehensive\" technology platform, addressing multiple points across the healthcare revenue cycle, is unique within a market dominated by point-solution technology vendors, manual processes, and healthcare IT services businesses. JPMorgan, Evercore ISI, BofA, William Blair, Raymond James, Barclays, RBC Capital, Deutsche Bank, and Canaccord also started coverage of the name with Buy-equivalent ratings. Jefferies initiated coverage of Rapport Therapeutics (RAPP) with a Buy rating and $35 price target. The firm thinks the company could disrupt the treatment paradigm of several $1B-plus central nervous disorders, starting with epilepsy. Stifel and TD Cowen also started coverage of the stock with Buy-equivalent ratings. Barclays initiated coverage of Viking Holdings(VIK) with an Overweight rating and $39 price target. The firm views Viking as a \"unique growth asset in an attractive sector.\" Stifel initiated coverage of Life360 (LIF) with a Buy rating and $37 price target. The firm views Life360 as a \"highly differentiated\" product aimed at keeping families, pets, and things safe.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Cathie Wood Says Software Is the Next Big AI Opportunity -- 2 Supercharged Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying if She's Right",
        "content": "Last year, Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood said software companies will be the next big opportunity in artificial intelligence (AI), predicting they will eventually generate $8 in revenue for every $1 spent on chips from leading suppliers like Nvidia.\n\nArk operates several funds (both private and exchange-traded) that reflect that stance. Using the Ark Venture Fund, Wood has piled into private AI software companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Elon Musk's xAI. Plus, Tesla is the largest holding in the flagship Ark Innovation ETF, which Wood says is the largest AI opportunity in the world thanks to its autonomous self-driving software.\n\nIf Wood is right about AI software, there could be a long list of winners in the coming years. Here's why CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) might be two of the biggest.\n\n1. CrowdStrike: A leader in AI-powered cybersecurity\n\nCrowdStrike is one of the world's best cybersecurity companies. In fact, its stock only needs to rise another 14% to eclipse the $104 billion valuation of the current industry leader, Palo Alto Networks. CrowdStrike's success stems from its unique lightweight security architecture and its reliance on AI to autonomously thwart attacks.\n\nCrowdStrike's AI models make over 180 million indicator-of-attack decisions every second -- in other words, they are constantly analyzing the motive and intent of attackers to determine the type of threat they pose. Those models are trained on more than 2 trillion security events each day, and that number climbs as more customers join CrowdStrike, which extends the company's AI advantage over its competitors.\n\nAll of that happens in the cloud. By using CrowdStrike, companies don't have to install bulky programs on every single device in their organization. Instead, they install a lightweight sensor that is connected to the cloud, which occupies minimal processing power compared to traditional cybersecurity software.\n\nCrowdStrike has taken a platform approach to cybersecurity since the day it was founded, which is in contrast to industry norms where different providers specialize in specific segments like cloud security, identity protection, and endpoint security. CrowdStrike covers all bases through its 28 modules, and while not every business needs the entire suite, 65% of customers were using five or more modules as of the recent fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 30).\n\nAccording to a CrowdStrike-sponsored study by International Data Corporation, businesses can save $6 for every $1 they invest in consolidating their cybersecurity needs onto the one platform. Therefore, not only do they get best-in-class protection, but switching to CrowdStrike is a no-brainer financially.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike ended Q1 with a record $3.6 billion in annual recurring revenue, but management believes that figure will surge 177% to $10 billion within the next five to seven years. That estimate might even be conservative considering how quickly AI is advancing, which will not only improve CrowdStrike's protective capabilities, but will create new threats that will drive more cybersecurity spending in the corporate sector.\n\n2. Meta Platforms: A social media giant turned AI developer\n\nMeta Platforms is home to leading social networks like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which serve 3.2 billion people every day. The company is already using AI to curate the content feeds for each user on Facebook and Instagram to ensure they are seeing posts that are most relevant to them. Last year, this drove an increase in engagement across both platforms, which provided Meta with more opportunities to generate advertising revenue.\n\nBut the company might have an even greater AI opportunity in its large language model (LLM) called Llama. It's the world's largest open-source model, so developers can use it for free to build their own AI applications, which allows Meta to crowdsource its testing to make improvements more quickly. That's important because Llama is the key to creating new AI features for Meta's existing platforms.\n\nFor example, the company launched a chatbot called Meta AI last year that users can access through Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. It can answer complex questions and generate images like most chatbots, but it can also be added to group chats to make restaurant and travel recommendations, or even offer gift ideas. Meta AI is currently powered by Llama 3, but the company is already training its next-generation model, which should offer even better capabilities.\n\nEventually, every business using Meta's apps could have its own personalized Meta AI-style chatbot that can handle incoming customer queries, and potentially even process sales. That should create new opportunities for Meta to generate revenue.\n\nHere's the best part about Meta stock: It's cheap. Based on the company's $17.41 in trailing-12-month earnings per share, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.9. That's a 9.4% discount to the 31.9 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index.\n\nIn 2025, Wall Street thinks Meta will generate $21.59 in earnings, which places its forward P/E ratio at just 23.3. That implies Meta stock will have to rise 36.9% by the end of next year just to trade in line with the broader tech sector.\n\nIf Cathie Wood is right about AI software, Meta stock might be an even bigger bargain today than the above numbers suggest, because there could be entirely new AI monetization opportunities to come as this story unfolds.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

The most recent evidence is the CDK Global ransomware event that affected tens of thousands of car dealerships across the U.S., causing them to revert to pen-and-paper procedures as critical software for sales and repairs became unavailable.\n\nOne way for organizations to prevent these attacks is AI-powered cybersecurity, like the kind developed by CrowdStrike. The company's cybersecurity platform monitors customers' networks and proactively identifies threats. What's more, the platform benefits from a strong network effect -- as more customers sign up with CrowdStrike, the company's AI becomes more effective.\n\nThe benefit of CrowdStrike's software is reflected in the company's outstanding financial results. CrowdStrike's trailing-12-month revenue has skyrocketed from $250 million to $3.3 billion -- a more than 10x increase -- in only five years.In addition, analystestimatesfor next year's revenue haveincreased to $5.1 billion. CRWD Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nSimply put, the company is riding a wave of demand for better, more agile cybersecurity solutions as the number of attempted cyberattacks continues to skyrocket. Growth-oriented investors should consider owning CrowdStrike stock now and for many years to come.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon, a colossal company, has established market leadership in its e-commerce and cloud computing divisions. However, its AI division has yet to make a significant impact. This could be about to change, as Amazon's AI division holds immense potential for growth.\n\nIts Alexa-enabled smart speakers are the most popular brand on the market. However, turning these devices into a profitable venture has proven to be a challenging task for the company. Image source: Statista.\n\nAccording to a recent report from Reuters, Amazon's management is now intensely focused on achieving profitability for its AI division. The company is considering potential solutions, such as a $5 or $10 monthly subscription to access-enhanced Alexa AI, to reach this goal.\n\nAmazon's AI division is not the only avenue for the company to tap into the AI boom. The massive Amazon Web Services (AWS) division, with its extensive network of data centers and advanced high-performance computing clusters, is well positioned to benefit from the generative AI surge. Furthermore, advances in AI could lead to increased e-commerce and advertising revenue for Amazon, as marketers and vendors leverage new AI techniques to drive sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are multiple pathways to AI success. While its smart devices division has struggled to turn a profit, new plans are being hatched that may achieve that goal. Meanwhile, the company's other divisions, including its lucrative AWS and advertising segments, stand to benefit as the AI revolution rolls on.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The\u00a0Nasdaq has more than 2,500 companies in its exchange. While the Nasdaq has performed well, investors enjoyed higher returns with the Nasdaq 100. This index includes the 100 largest corporations by market cap that are already on the Nasdaq. Given this benchmark\u2019s outperformance, it seems like a good idea to see which stocks are inside.\n\nUnsurprisingly, investors will find many tech companies on the list. Many tech giants have diversified their revenue streams and have multiple opportunities to generate meaningful returns for shareholders. These corporations can also acquire smaller companies to capitalize on the latest trends. One multi-trillion-dollar tech giant ended up making the list.\n\nHowever,\u00a0there are\u00a0two other companies to monitor\u00a0that\u00a0are worth buying with $500.\u00a0While you\u2019ll have to settle with fractional shares for one of those companies, you can buy a\u00a0full\u00a0share of the other company and still have some cash left over. These are some of the smartest Nasdaq stocks to buy with $500\u00a0right now:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) sign reading Google inside building\n\nSource: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) boasts rising profit margins and improved revenue growth thanks to online advertising and cloud computing. Leadership has been paying more attention to the bottom line and\u00a0has been making some cuts while delivering higher sales. Thus, I think it is one of the best Nasdaq stocks to buy.\n\nRevenue increased by 15% year-over-year in the\u00a0first quarter, while\u00a0net income was up by 57% YoY. Investors have been scooping up shares, prompting a 29% year-to-date gain and a 221% increase over the past five years.\u00a0Alphabet initially\u00a0started slowly\u00a0due to some Gemini mishaps, but those blunders are now distant memories.\u00a0Advertising revenue continues to grow, and Google Cloud is growing even faster.\u00a0This segment was up by 28.4% YoY, accounting\u00a0for $9.6 billion of Alphabet\u2019s $80.5 billion in Q1 2024 revenue.\n\nWall Street analysts are optimistic about the tech giant and rated it as a\u00a0\u201cStrong Buy.\u201d\u00a0The average price target suggests a 10% upside from current levels.\n\nCostco (COST) A photo of a Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) retail storefront.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nYou\u2019ll have to settle for a fractional share to put $500 into\u00a0Costco (NASDAQ:COST). The wholesaler offers competitive\u00a0prices for various products\u00a0and generates recurring revenue from annual memberships. Those membership fees incentivize people to shop at Costco more often to make the most\u00a0out\u00a0of their memberships.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street analysts have rated the stock\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0\u201cStrong Buy,\u201d with the highest price target of $960 suggesting a 13% upside. Costco has rewarded analysts\u2019 enthusiasm in the past. Shares are up\u00a0by\u00a030% year-to-date and have more than tripled over the past five years.\n\nCostco recently reported May sales results that indicate the company is still growing. Comparable sales increased by 6.4% YoY\u00a0while\u00a0the e-commerce segment was up by 15.3% year-over-year. Both\u00a0of those\u00a0growth rates represent acceleration from the company\u2019s 39-week growth rates. Costco is a reliable wholesaler during economic booms and busts. People will always want to save money, and Costco specializes in that area.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is standing out from other cybersecurity stocks.\u00a0The firm\u00a0continues\u00a0to report excellent revenue growth while competitors\u00a0report\u00a0decelerating revenue growth.\u00a0CrowdStrike even offered strong guidance that suggests more growth is on the way.\n\nRevenue increased by 33% YoY in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The firm also closed\u00a0out\u00a0the quarter with $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue. High revenue growth isn\u2019t the only benefactor\u00a0that\u2019s been\u00a0propelling the stock higher. Net income\u00a0came in at\u00a0$42.8 million compared to $0.5 million in the same quarter last year. Rising profits should help the P/E ratio and result in long-term gains for investors. That makes it one of the best Nasdaq stocks to buy, at least in my book.\n\nCrowdStrike has\u00a0certainly\u00a0delivered for patient investors. Shares are up by 54% year-to-date and have gained more than 400% over the past five years. Wall Street is unanimous with its\u00a0\u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating and believes that the stock has more room to run.\n\nOn this\u00a0date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in GOOG and CRWD.

The company's earnings are projected to grow significantly by 34.8% annually, outpacing the US market's expected 14.7%. This growth is supported by strategic expansions and partnerships across Latin America and with major tech distributors like Ingram Micro and M3Corp, enhancing its AI-native cybersecurity solutions' reach and efficacy in emerging markets. Despite recent shareholder dilution, CrowdStrike's robust projected revenue growth of 20.1% annually positions it as a potentially undervalued stock based on cash flows.\n\nOur comprehensive growth report raises the possibility that CrowdStrike Holdings is poised for substantial financial growth.

Despite a substantial 408.3% earnings growth over the past year and an expected annual profit growth of 31.2%, Pure Storage's revenue growth projection is relatively modest at 11.1% annually compared to faster-growing peers. Recent innovations in AI and storage solutions, including the new Evergreen//One for AI, may bolster its competitive edge but significant insider selling and shareholder dilution over the past year could raise concerns about its future performance stability.\n\nOur expertly prepared growth report on Pure Storage implies its future financial outlook may be stronger than recent results.

Despite a recent dip in Q1 2024 earnings and sales, the firm's strategic alliances aim to innovate and enhance product offerings, potentially boosting future cash flows. However, its dividend coverage remains weak due to these lower cash flows. With expected significant annual earnings growth over the next three years and revenue projected to outpace the market significantly, E Ink could present an appealing opportunity for value investors focused on growth potential from cash flow perspectives.\n\nUpon reviewing our latest growth report, E Ink Holdings' projected financial performance appears quite optimistic.

Businesses no longer have to invest in physical servers and storage space to operate smoothly.\n\nMany tech\u00a0giant\u00a0have rolled out cloud platforms over the years, and other companies specialize in\u00a0keeping those platforms protected. Many cloud computing stocks have delivered exceptional returns over the years, as scalability allows margins to expand rapidly once\u00a0it\u00a0becomes profitable.\n\nCloud computing has been hot for several years, but artificial intelligence is adding more fuel to the fire. Artificial intelligence requires significant computing power and data storage capabilities.\u00a0Cloud platforms help\u00a0to\u00a0enable many AI tools and\u00a0give corporations the opportunity\u00a0to use this innovative technology.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArtificial intelligence is part of\u00a0the reason that\u00a0the cloud computing market\u00a0is projected\u00a0to maintain a\u00a0compounded annual growth rate of 16.40% through 2029.

Amazon Web Services has almost one-third of the market. The company is also working on a ChatGPT alternative to expand its reach in the AI market.\n\nThe tech giant\u2019s\u00a0overall\u00a0sales increased by 13% year-over-year to reach $143.3 billion in the\u00a0first quarter. Those sales include Amazon\u2019s online marketplace\u00a0which\u00a0has helped the company expand into numerous industries. Amazon Web Services notably grew\u00a0at a faster rate\u00a0\u2014 17% year-over-year \u2014 to reach $25.0 billion.\n\nAmazon stock has been on a tear. It\u2019s up\u00a0by\u00a029% year-to-date and has roughly doubled over the past five years. The stock is approaching a $2 trillion market cap and has a 54 P/E ratio.

ServiceNow exceeded guidance in the\u00a0first quarter by reporting $2.6 billion in revenue. That\u2019s a 24% year-over-year increase. More than $2.5 billion of the company\u2019s Q1 revenue was recurring.\n\nServiceNow enables digital workflows and helps companies become more efficient. Customers have been flocking to the Now Platform and they\u2019re also paying a lot of money.\n\nThe company closed eight new transactions with annual contract values above $8 million in the first quarter.

Almost 2,000 of the firm\u2019s customers have annual contract values\u00a0that are\u00a0greater than $1 million.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table.

While AWS reported 17% year-over-year revenue growth, Google Cloud\u2019s revenue increased by 28.4% year-over-year to reach $9.57 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only highlight from\u00a0Alphabet\u2019s first quarter results. Overall revenue increased by 15% year-over-year while net income surged by 57% year-over-year.\n\nNet income growth is a big highlight,\u00a0since it prompted the tech conglomerate to offer its first quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. Alphabet reported a 29.4% net profit margin to close out the quarter, and if\u00a0cost cutting\u00a0measures continue, the firm can\u00a0end up with\u00a0elevated gains in the future.\n\nAlphabet still trades at a reasonable 28 P/E ratio.\u00a0It\u2019s the\u00a0online advertising leader and also one of the leaders in\u00a0cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\u00a0Wall Street analysts believe\u00a0that Alphabet\u00a0shares can\u00a0gain an additional 9% from current levels.\n\nOracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) offers hardware and software products, but its software segment has been the main growth driver.

Overall\u00a0revenue only inched up by 3% year-over-year to reach $14.3 billion.\n\nArtificial intelligence tailwinds should help Oracle\u2019s cloud platform generate\u00a0a higher percentage of\u00a0total revenue. This development should result in growth acceleration since the lagging segments won\u2019t have as much of an impact.\n\nOracle shares are up by 36% year-to-date and have gained 138% over the past five years. The stock trades at a 38 P/E ratio and offers a 1.13% yield.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background..

However, none of those segments are as\u00a0important\u00a0as Microsoft Cloud.\n\nThe company\u2019s cloud platform generated $35.1 billion in\u00a0Q3 FY24 revenue, which is a 23% improvement compared to the same quarter last year. Microsoft also reported 17% year-over-year revenue growth across the board and grew its net income by 20%\u00a0year-over-year.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot allows the company to expand into numerous industries and presents a compelling long-term opportunity. Copilot is slowly\u00a0being integrated\u00a0across Microsoft\u2019s software products like LinkedIn and other places.\n\nCopilot\u00a0also has a cybersecurity division that\u00a0should increase Microsoft\u2019s presence in that vertical.\u00a0Artificial intelligence and cloud computing both present long-term growth opportunities for Microsoft.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Businesses can detect and address threats before they get\u00a0serious\u00a0and fortify their digital defenses.\n\nCloud platforms make it easier to store data and access digital files. While this is a boon for many businesses, putting everything on the web\u00a0also\u00a0makes it a target for hackers.\n\nCybercriminals attempt to infiltrate databases and access sensitive information about customers, people within the company and corporate assets\n\nAs such, the cybersecurity firm generates plenty of revenue.\u00a0Q1 FY25 revenue came in at $921.0 million,\u00a0which\u00a0is a\u00a033% year-over-year increase.\u00a0Crowdstrike\u2019s $3.65 billion\u00a0in\u00a0annual recurring revenue should support additional growth in the upcoming quarters. Net income\u00a0came in at\u00a0$42.8 million compared to a $0.5 million profit in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe stock has comfortably outperformed the market. Crowdstrike shares are up by 55% year-to-date and have gained 470% over the past five years.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree.

After\u00a0a lot of\u00a0hard work, the company now finds itself in the center of cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\n\nUnlike most cloud computing stocks, IBM still has a reasonable valuation. Shares trade at a 19.6 P/E ratio and offer a 3.85% yield. The stock has gained 28% over the past year.\n\nWall Street analysts have rated the stock as a\u00a0\u201cModerate Buy\u201d and are projecting a 6% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $215 per share suggests that IBM can gain an additional 24%.\n\nIBM reported 1%\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0revenue growth and 69%\u00a0year-over-year net income growth\u00a0in the\u00a0first quarter.\u00a0Rising profit margins make the stock look more attractive, and the firm is also\u00a0in the process of\u00a0acquiring HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP) for $6.4 billion. This acquisition will expand IBM\u2019s hybrid cloud market share and position it to benefit more from AI tailwinds.\n\nOn this\u00a0date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AMZN, NOW, GOOG, MSFT and CRWD.

        "title": "Should You Buy CrowdStrike Stock Now That It's Part of the S&amp;P 500?",
        "content": "The latest rebalancing for the S&P 500 took place in mid-June, and cybersecurity darling CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) earned a spot in the esteemed index. While getting added to the S&P 500 is an impressive milestone, it's not reason enough to buy a stock. Nevertheless, CrowdStrike is firing on all cylinders, and I think it's best days are ahead.\n\nLet's dig into the company's progress and explore why now is a lucrative opportunity for long-term investors to own CrowdStrike.\n\nCrowdStrike is in a league of its own\n\nCrowdStrike operates in the cybersecurity industry and specializes in threat detection and endpoint protection through its flagship platform, called Falcon. While the cybersecurity landscape is ripe with competition, CrowdStrike stands out as a winner, thanks to its proven ability to cross-sell.\n\nFor the company's first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 30), nearly two-thirds of CrowdStrike's total customers were using five or more products. Moreover, new deals with eight or more products increased 95% year over year. By selling multiple products to its customer base, CrowdStrike can expand its recurring revenue base, all while recognizing strong profit growth.\n\nFor the quarter ended April 30, CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue (ARR) increased 33% year over year to $3.7 billion. Furthermore, the company posted net income of $43 million during the first quarter, compared to just $0.5 million during the same period last year.\n\nThe combination of accelerating revenue and profit growth is encouraging, and I think it's just getting started. Image source: Getty Images\n\nThe party is just getting started\n\nBack in 2022, CrowdStrike released an investor presentation showcasing a total addressable market (TAM) size of $75 billion at that time. Management further explained that with the company's current product portfolio at that time, the TAM could reach $97 billion by 2025 and $158 billion by 2026 should CrowdStrike execute on its new-product roadmap.\n\nClearly, a lot has changed over the last couple of years. Not only are cybersecurity protocols more important than ever to combat hackers and protect data and privacy, but developments in artificial intelligence (AI) are making their way to just about every use case in the tech realm.\n\nAccording to the company's most recent investor presentation, CrowdStrike now believes its TAM is $100 billion. What's more, management sees the addressable market expanding to $225 billion by 2028 as generative AI becomes increasingly featured in cybersecurity tools.\n\nIs CrowdStrike a good stock to buy right now?\n\nCrowdStrike has proven that it can compete in an intense cybersecurity market and do so in a highly profitable way. Moreover, as AI demand continues to surge, the company should be in a position to benefit from secular tailwinds.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe one drawback of investing in CrowdStrike is its pricey valuation. Right now, its stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 96 and a price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) multiple of 93.\n\nSimply put, the stock is expensive -- even for growth investors. With that said, I still think CrowdStrike is a compelling opportunity.\n\nThe rate at which the company and its addressable market are growing shouldn't go unnoticed. Cybersecurity in and of itself is a big market, and CrowdStrike has built a formidable position, even though there are many larger, better-capitalized players. Furthermore, now that AI has become increasingly more important for businesses of all sizes, CrowdStrike fits squarely at the intersection of two of the tech sector's hottest end markets.\n\nConsidering the company's ARR of $3.7 billion represents only 1.6% of the current estimated market size, CrowdStrike has a long way to go before its business starts to mature or plateau.\n\nI think CrowdStrike's premium valuation is warranted and I am optimistic the company can continue generating strong top-line growth, supplemented by robust cash flow. Long-term investors may want to consider a position in CrowdStrike as a hedge to other AI stocks. It's a leading company among cybersecurity opportunities.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Crowdstrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other cloud computing stocks. You can also check out the 10 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Under $10 here.\n\nCloud computing has changed the way we access and manage computing resources. The industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Market estimates suggest a jump from a size of $0.68 trillion in 2024 to a projected $1.44 trillion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4%. This upward trend is expected to continue, with the market reaching a value of almost $2.5 trillion by 2032. These figures point towards a rising adoption and utilization of cloud solutions across various industries.\n\nThe growth in the industry is likely to be driven by a number of factors. One key factor is the growing recognition among large enterprises of the impact that cloud computing can have on their operations. In fact, an impressive 94% of companies across the globe have already adopted cloud computing solutions. This high rate of adoption is expected to have a remarkable economic impact, with forecasts showing that it could generate approximately $3 trillion in revenue by the year 2030.\n\nCurrently, North America and Europe are leading the way in cloud computing adoption, with Asia Pacific not far behind. North America holds the largest share of the global market at 41%. The region's early adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has played a key role in driving its cloud market growth.\n\nEven with stricter regulations around data privacy and security, the European markets are also displaying consistent growth in cloud adoption. Countries like Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark are leading the way in cloud adoption within specific industries. This suggests that European businesses are increasingly recognizing the value of cloud solutions while navigating a regulatory landscape that prioritizes data protection.\n\nThe Asia Pacific region is also currently experiencing a rise in cloud computing adoption. The market size rose to an estimated $32.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to be a significant contributor to the global cloud computing market in the coming years. This growth can be attributed to a large-scale shift towards digital business models across various industries in the region. The need for cost-effective solutions has fueled cloud adoption among small and medium businesses (SMBs). Approximately 78% of SMBs are currently using cloud services, with 39% of these businesses spending up to $600,000 per year on public cloud services.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the best cloud computing stocks to buy now, we relied on Insider Monkey\u2019s extensive database of 920 hedge funds as of Q1 2024.

        "title": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) Eyes Latin America With New Distribution Deal",
        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD is making strategic moves to bolster its presence in the Latin American market through new partnerships with leading technology distributors. The cybersecurity giant has joined forces with Ingram Micro, M3Corp and Tecnolog\u00eda Especializada Asociada de M\u00e9xico (TEAM Mexico) to accelerate the adoption of its AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon platform across the region.\n\nThe new distribution deals are aimed at expanding the reach of CrowdStrike's advanced cybersecurity solutions in Mexico, Brazil, and the broader Latin American market. These strategic partnerships should enable local businesses to access the Falcon platform, known for its AI-driven capabilities in detecting and stopping breaches. By leveraging the extensive partner networks and expertise of Ingram Micro, M3Corp and TEAM Mexico, CrowdStrike aims to drive vendor consolidation and enhance cybersecurity defense across the region.\n\nLatin America has seen a significant increase in cyber threats, particularly from eCrime actors employing sophisticated techniques to bypass traditional cyber defenses. The need for unified cybersecurity solutions has never been greater, as fragmented point products often fail to provide comprehensive protection and can increase operational costs and complexity. CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform offers a unified approach, simplifying cybersecurity management while enhancing protection across all key attack surfaces.\n\nThe move is expected to not only boost CrowdStrike's presence in Latin America but also enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of businesses in the region. The latest distribution agreements align with CrowdStrike's broader strategy of driving global market leadership through strategic partnerships and advanced cybersecurity solutions.\n\nCrowdStrike is riding on a strong and innovative portfolio with the growing adoption of its Falcon platform. Shares of the company have rallied 51.7% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Internet - Software industry\u2019s growth of 14.7%.\n\nCrowdStrike Price and Consensus\n\nCrowdStrike price-consensus-chart | CrowdStrike Quote\n\nStrengthening Portfolio With Partnerships\n\nCrowdStrike has partnered with several technology companies, including Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE, NVIDIA NVDA and Cloudflare NET, to enhance its product capabilities.\n\nCrowdStrike collaborated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise last week to integrate HPE GreenLake and OpsRamp AIOps with its Falcon cybersecurity platform. The company\u2019s partnership with NVDA allows it to merge the Falcon platform data with NVIDIA's GPU-optimized AI pipelines and NIM microservices, enabling their shared customers to seamlessly create custom and secure generative AI models.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe partnership between CrowdStrike and Cloudflare is focused on integrating Cloudflare One Zero Trust protection solution with CRWD\u2019s Falcon Next-Gen SIEM to improve the security of their joint channel partners.\n\nRobust portfolio strength and crucial partnerships are driving CrowdStrike\u2019s financial performance. The company\u2019s non-GAAP earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 15.8%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $4 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 30.9%. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 non-GAAP earnings is currently pinned at $3.98 per share, suggesting growth of 28.8% year over year.\n\nConclusion\n\nCrowdStrike's strategic push into Latin America is a timely move, given the region's growing digital landscape and increasing cyber threats. By partnering with established distributors, CrowdStrike can tap into their extensive networks and local market expertise, accelerating the adoption of its Falcon platform.\n\nCRWD\u2019s diversified product portfolio, strong partner base and expanding clientele make it an important player in this sphere. These strengths, coupled with its solid financial performance, position the company as a promising opportunity for long-term growth.\n\nDespite its strengths, CrowdStrike\u2019s near-term prospects might be hurt by softening IT spending. The still-high interest rates and protracted inflationary conditions have negatively impacted consumer spending. Meanwhile, enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues.\n\nMoreover, CrowdStrike\u2019s valuation looks stretched at the current level, as reflected by the Value Score of F. We note that CRWD currently has a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 89.42. This level compares unfavorably to the industry\u2019s average of 34.56.

        "title": "3 Cybersecurity Stocks That Could Make Your Grandchildren Rich",
        "content": "The rise in cybercrime in recent years, driven by increased digitization and attackers deploying more advanced technologies, has increased investor interest in cybersecurity stocks for long-term growth.\n\nTo put things into perspective, experts predict that the cost of cybercrime will reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. That\u2019s a massive number, considering that most cyberattacks can be prevented with better detection.\n\nIn response to these challenges, companies deploying technologies to combat malicious attacks are experiencing significant growth. The global cybersecurity market was $222.6 billion in 2023 and will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.3% until 2030.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOne primary driver of this growth is AI, and its benefits are twofold. First, AI can be harnessed to detect potential cyber threats in a large volume of data in real time. Second, AI can identify areas requiring greater security controls through machine learning. This will help companies implement better prevention strategies while lowering costs.\n\nAs a result, companies actively incorporating AI in their cybersecurity offerings have become indispensable to businesses. Consequently, this has made them a wealth-generation channel for investors seeking long-term returns.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nThe increase in cybercrime has sparked interest in cybersecurity stocks for long-term growth. Leading the charge is CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), whose shares surged over 173% this year. Several factors contribute to its success.\n\nThe first is a unique \u2018pay for what you pick\u2019 business model that has proven extremely successful. This approach allows customers to consolidate and customize modules to suit their needs on the platform. According to CrowdStrike, nearly 28% of its customers have adopted seven or more modules.\n\nThe second is its commitment to operating with a cloud-native architecture. CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon Horizon platform leverages automation and AI to identify threats across multi-cloud applications, thereby reducing cyberattack costs. Additionally, it allows users to manage workloads across cloud platforms through a single console.\n\nThis forward-thinking approach has paid off for the company. In its recent earnings report, revenue rose 33% to $921 million, with subscription revenue up 34% year-over-year (YoY). Revenue guidance for the full year was also raised by 30%.\n\nAs a leader in the cybersecurity space, CRWD trades at a premium valuation and is not a bargain buy. However, investors willing to hold the stock will find it to be one of the top cybersecurity stocks for long-term growth. The company was recently added to the S&P 500.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother company making waves in the cybersecurity space is Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). While the company is well known for its advanced firewall technology and cybersecurity solutions, Palo Alto\u2019s Unit 42 gives it a competitive edge. Unit 42 is a team of world-renowned threat researchers that help federal agencies assess readiness and mitigate cyber risks. This research capability allows the company to gather valuable data and refine its risk mitigation strategies.\n\nThe success of Palo Alto\u2019s cybersecurity services was evident in its most recent earnings report. Revenue was up 15% YOY to $2 billion, and EPS came in at $1.32 over the estimated $1.26. However, shares fell 9% following weak billing guidance. Billing for the fiscal year will land in the $10.13 billion to $10.18 billion range, below the $10.19 billion estimate.\n\nBut despite the decline, PANW stock remains fundamentally strong. The company has exhibited consistent growth over the years, and its array of AI-powered cybersecurity solutions will serve as a catalyst for continued expansion.\n\nThe recent dip presents a great buying opportunity for investors looking to get behind cybersecurity stocks for long-term growth.\n\nCloudflare (NET) Exterior view of Cloudflare headquarters. NET stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nA third name on this list of cybersecurity stocks to buy for long-term returns is Cloudflare (NYSE:NET). The company has embraced the role of GenAI in its offerings, proving it to be a useful tool in combating cyber attacks. Cloudflare\u2019s services include a content delivery network (CDN) that stores cached copies of websites closer to the site\u2019s visitors for easier access and a tool to help organizations combat bot-based attacks.\n\nClouflare\u2019s recent earnings report underscored the success of its offerings. Revenue in Q1 was up 30% YOY at $378.6 million. Adjusted EPS came in at 16 cents, surpassing an estimate of 13 cents. The company hopes to keep this momentum going through Q2, with revenue ranging between $393.5 million and $394.5 million.\n\nLooking ahead, Cloudflare is well-positioned to thrive in an AI-focused cybersecurity environment. The company maintains a successful partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), providing security enhancements for its users. Cloudflare\u2019s technology will also help encrypt AI queries in Apple\u2019s new Private Cloud Compute (PCC).\n\nThe company\u2019s promising prospects make this a good stock to add to your portfolio for long-term returns.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Smartest Tech Stocks to Buy With $5,000 Right Now",
        "content": "Technology stocks remain hot with plenty of great options to choose right now. Cybersecurity, cryptocurrencies, social media and anything related to artificial intelligence (AI) have the attention of investors and analysts. And this has sent the share prices of these companies sharply higher.\n\nFurther, many tech stocks have enjoyed blistering rallies since the current bull market began in late 2022. Yet, investors still have an opportunity to take positions in strong tech stocks. And, they can ride their share prices to even greater heights. Many tech stocks that have performed strongly in recent months are expected to keep on rallying going forward.\n\nSo, let\u2019s delve into three of the smartest tech stocks to buy with $5,000 right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity remains a hot area of tech, and CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a top pick. The company\u2019s stock has proven to be a long-term winner. It gained 56% this year, 172% in the last 12 months and 500% since going public five years ago. CRWD stock has steadily marched higher amid strong growth and powerhouse financial results. Recently, the stock was added to the S&P 500 index.\n\nAlso, CrowdStrike reported financial results for this year\u2019s Q1 that beat Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines. The cybersecurity firm reported EPS of 93 cents, beating consensus estimates of 89 cents. Revenue totaled $921 million, up 34% from a year earlier and ahead of estimates that called for $905 million in sales. CrowdStrike\u2019s free cash flow stood at $322.5 million at quarter\u2019s end, up 42% from the previous year.\n\nAnalysts continue to rate CrowdStrike stock a strong buy. All 31 analysts who track the company\u2019s progress giving the shares a buy rating.\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline brokerage Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) is another tech stock that has been on fire this year.\n\nSo far in 2024, HOOD stock has gained 80%, bringing its 12 month increase to 130%. The company\u2019s share price has been rising amid the current bull market as retail investors return to the fray and trade stocks more frequently. Also, Robinhood Markets has gotten a boost from the rebound in cryptocurrency trading.\n\nFurther, HOOD is expanding its role in cryptocurrency through the acquisition of privately held crypto exchange Bitstamp for $200 million in cash. The purchase is the largest deal in the company\u2019s 11-year history and moves it further into the trading of cryptocurrencies. Analysts say the purchase of Bitstamp puts Robinhood Marketsin direct competition with the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and CoinbaseGlobal (NASDAQ:COIN).\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Bitstamp\u2019s crypto exchange is popular in Europe and Asia, offering more than 85 tradable assets that include products such as staking and lending. HOOD\u2019s cryptocurrency business is seeing rapid growth fueled by price increases for digital assets. Crypto trading was largely responsible for Robinhood Martkets reporting record first-quarter financial results.\n\nReddit (RDDT) Reddit (RDDT) paper logo lies with envelope full of dollar bills and smartphone. Reddit IPO\n\nSource: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com\n\nSocial media company Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) has a lot going for it. The company recently announced a new partnership with AI start-up company OpenAI. The OpenAI partnership is expected to attract more users to Reddit\u2019s social media platform with AI-enhancements and more advertising. Specifically, the new partnership allows Reddit to leverage OpenAI\u2019s technology, including its ChatGPT platform, to build tools and features that integrate Reddit\u2019s content in real-time.\n\nAlso, OpenAI has committed to becoming an advertising partner of Reddit, which runs online message boards, including the popular WallStreetBets site. Reddit generates nearly all of its revenue from online advertising on its message boards. The company currently has 82 million active users. RDDT went public on March 21 of this year, and its first earnings report as a publicly traded company was impressive.\n\nThe still unprofitable company reported a loss per share of $8.19, which was not as bad as a loss of $8.71 that was expected among analysts. Revenue in the quarter totaled $243 million versus $212.8 million that was forecast on Wall Street. Sales rose 48% from a year earlier.

        "content": "Investors in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 19, 2024 $110.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for CrowdStrike shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, CrowdStrike is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Internet - Software industry that ranks in the Top 30% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, 12 analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from earnings of 90 cents per share to 98 cents in that period.\r\n\r\nGiven the way analysts feel about CrowdStrike right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

CRWD\u2019s revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 grew 33% year-over-year. And its AI focus has generated huge growth in share value since the firm\u2019s 2019 initial public offering, with a consensus per-share earnings estimate of $3.98 for the year.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder CRWD shares are up 48% this year \u2013 and they could rise more.

        "content": "Growth stocks to buy on the dip have the potential to significantly outperform the stock market. Some of these assets can accumulate generational returns and get passed down to your heirs. However, these same stocks often experience declines on the way to new highs. Stock dips are common, and it\u2019s important not to panic.\n\nAccording to the Fear & Greed Index, panic may be setting in. The latest reading of 41 suggests that fear is partially driving the stock market, but not to a strong degree. When you invest in any asset, including stocks, you sign up for dips. These dips offer buying opportunities since they let you buy your favorite companies at discounts.\n\nKnowing which growth stocks to buy on the dip will leave you better prepared. Investor should narrow their search to companies that exhibit high revenue growth and rising profit margins. These are some of the growth stocks to buy on the dip to consider for long-term growth investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been a juggernaut in the cybersecurity industry. The firm continues to grow while its competitors cite headwinds as reasons for slower revenue growth. Crowdstrike reported 33% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 FY25 and closed out the quarter with $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue.\n\nCybersecurity will remain an essential service for many years. Businesses put a lot of their information online, and they also store customers\u2019 information in their databases. Hackers try to get into these databases and access a company\u2019s private files. Furthermore, the cyber criminals are using artificial intelligence to scale their attacks. This use of AI demonstrates how innovative technology can become dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands. Luckily, Crowdstrike is also upping its defenses with the help of artificial intelligence.\n\nCybersecurity is becoming a battle of AI vs. AI, and it\u2019s been beneficial for long-term investors. Crowdstrike stock has gained 54% year-to-date and is up by 427% over the past five years.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been crushing the stock market for many years as businesses rush to run advertisements and rank higher on the company\u2019s search engines. The stock has gained 29% year-to-date and has more than tripled over the past five years. A 28 P/E ratio and a strengthened focus on profit margins makes the stock attractive at current levels.\n\nWall Street analysts seem to agree with that assertion. Alphabet is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d with a projected 10% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $225 per share suggests that Alphabet can gain an additional 25%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost of the company\u2019s revenue comes from advertisements, but more than 10% of its revenue comes from cloud computing. Alphabet can continue to diversify its revenue with artificial intelligence and other initiatives. Overall revenue increased by 15% year-over-year in Q1 2024 while net income surged by 57% year-over-year. Alphabet wrapped up the first quarter with a 29.4% net profit margin.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been on a tear. Shares are up by 43% year-to-date amid a stock split and have gained 342% over the past five years. Higher prices haven\u2019t stopped Chipotle\u2019s customers from regularly buying food at its venues. Revenue increased by 14.1% year-over-year in Q1 2024 while net income was up by 23.2% year-over-year.\n\nChipotle should continue to grow its revenue and net income based on its recent expansion. The restaurant chain opened up 47 new restaurants with 43 of them including a mobile pickup drive-thru window. The company remains on pace to open 285-315 restaurants this year. Comparable sales growth of 7% year-over-year indicates that many of its restaurants continue to generate traction, so growth isn\u2019t entirely reliant on the company opening up new locations.\n\nThe stock is currently rated as a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d among 27 analysts with a projected 3% upside. The highest pre-split price target of $3,888 suggests a potential 21% gain from current levels.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) also has a lot of analysts behind it. The stock is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d and has a projected 6% upside. The highest price target of $593 per share suggests that Facebook\u2019s parent company can gain an additional 20%. The stock is up by 43% year-to-date and has gained 159% over the past five years. Meta Platforms trades at a 28.5 P/E ratio and is valued at $1.26 trillion.\n\nThe social media firm recently offered a dividend. Investors currently get a 0.40% yield, but shareholders should expect the company to maintain a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years. Profit margins are north of 30% as the company continues to refine its business model with a focus on efficiency.\n\nNet income more than doubled year-over-year in Q1 2024 while revenue still marched forward to the tune of a 27% year-to-date gain. Meta Platforms also has a healthy balance sheet which features $58.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n\nHubSpot (HUBS) Hubspot (HUBS) logo displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nHubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) has been generating more buzz amid acquisition rumors. Alphabet has been rumored to be making an offer for several months, but now there\u2019s competition. An unnamed company appears to be in the mix for acquiring the $30 billion customer relationship management software firm.\n\nAlthough this speculation is helping the stock price, HubSpot hasn\u2019t needed the rumor mill to generate returns for investors. The stock is up by 6% year-to-date and has more than tripled over the past five years. Many businesses use HubSpot to communicate with their customers more effectively and increase their conversions. HubSpot has many monthly and annual subscriptions available which results in steady recurring revenue.\n\nHubSpot continues to report strong financials amid its recurring revenue model. Total revenue increased by 23% year-over-year in the first quarter to reach $617.4 million. GAAP net income came in at $5.9 million compared to a net loss of $36.6 million in the same quarter last year. Rising revenue and profit margins create a good opportunity even if an acquisition doesn\u2019t pan out. However, an acquisition can result in a surging stock price and one last hurrah for investors before a big tech firm adds the company to its product mix.\n\nCintas (CTAS) Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) has more than one million customers in various industries. The firm provides business supplies, safety equipment and other resources for businesses. Cintas generates steady revenue from its customers since many businesses need supplies and safety equipment in order to function properly. A lack of safety equipment can bring production to a halt and make them non-compliant.\n\nCintas has been outperforming the stock market for several years. Shares are up by 20% year-to-date and have more than tripled over the past five years. The $72 billion firm trades at a 49 P/E ratio and offers a 0.76% yield. Cintas has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years and has raised its dividend for more than 40 consecutive years.\n\nA high dividend isn\u2019t the only positive attribute for this stock. Cintas reported solid financials, including 9.9% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 FY24. Net income jumped by 22.0% year-over-year to reach $397.6 million.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSynopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is on of the stocks to buy on the dip that have been outperforming the stock market. Shares are up by 21% year-to-date and have soared by 370% over the past five years. The corporation has a $93 billion market cap and trades at a 66 P/E ratio.\n\nSynopsys has been in business for more than 35 years and generates over $5 billion in annual revenue. The company\u2019s chips are used in self-driving cars, machine learning devices, 5G technology, and other devices. Synopsys also generates revenue from its software which results in healthy profit margins.\n\nThe firm reported 15% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 FY24 which was at the high-end of guidance. Net income increased by 7% year-over-year. Synopsys closed out the quarter with a 20.1% net profit margin.\n\nWall Street is optimistic about SNPS, and believe it is one of the growth stocks to buy on the dip that has more room to run. It is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d among 10 analysts and has a projected 7% upside.

        "content": "Cybersecurity company Crowdstrike\u2019s (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock joined the S&P 500 index alongside the stocks of GoDaddy (NASDAQ:GDDY) and KKR (NYSE:KKR).\n\nCRWD stock rose sharply in pre-market trading this morning. Despite a slight dip around 11:00 a.m. Eastern, the shares have been mostly stable since the market opened. CRWD stock carries a price of $378 per share and a market capitalization of about $92 billion. Shares are up 53% so far in 2024 and nearly 490% since it came public about five years ago.\n\nBig Days for CyberCops\n\nCybersecurity has become a huge market over the last few years due to growing global tensions, the rise of criminal gangs, and the increased complexity of cloud-based computing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe total market was estimated to be worth $181 billion last year and is growing at 10% per year.\n\nCrowdstrike, based in Austin, is considered the leader in endpoint security within the cloud security market. It has about 18% of that $8.6 billion market despite competing directly with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company is expanding into general cloud security.\n\nFor the quarter ending in May Crowdstrike earned $43 million, 18 cents per share fully diluted, on revenue of $921 million. The company is estimating full-year earnings will be about $4 per share on revenue of about $4 billion.\n\nCrowdstrike\u2019s lead product is Falcon Defender, which it says can detect a cyberattack on a client\u2019s infrastructure in just four minutes. Equivalent products using the same tests from Microsoft and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) took 24 minutes to detect an attack. Crowdstrike also said its attack reports were more accurate than those of competitors.\n\nStocks entering the S&P 500 always get a boost as hedge funds trading the index are required to buy them. Shares of private equity firm KKR have gone up 11% since their inclusion was announced.\n\nCrowdstrike has recently benefited from Microsoft\u2019s bungled launch of its Recall feature. Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz has called Microsoft\u2019s statements on cybersecurity \u201clip service.\u201d\n\nCRWD Stock: What Happens Next?\n\nCybersecurity will remain a hot market but will also remain subject to disruption by new technology. No lead is truly safe.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in MSFT, and PANW.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why CrowdStrike (CRWD) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned +8.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.7% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 0% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.98 per share, indicating a change of +32.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.98 points to a change of +28.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -18.2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.84 indicates a change of +21.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for CrowdStrike.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate of $959.55 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +31.2%. The $4 billion and $5.01 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +30.8% and +25.5%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $921.04 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +33%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.57 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $904.82 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.79%. The EPS surprise was +4.49%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "If investors want to future-proof their portfolio, they should purchase strong buy cybersecurity stocks since cyber assaults are becoming more sophisticated and could cost $9.5 trillion globally in 2024.\n\nCloud intrusions soared 75%, and malware-free attacks increased dramatically, the 2024 CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) Global Threat Report reveals. These assaults use legitimate credentials and technology, making them hard to detect and counter.\u200b\n\nOver 25% of 2023 attacks were on manufacturing. Financial cyberattacks, including interactive hacking, rose 80%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurther emphasizing the importance of cyber attacks and strong buy cybersecurity stocks, the SEC compels stock market firms to notify significant hacking instances within four business days.\n\nIn addition, the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s National Cybersecurity Strategy emphasizes the importance of strong cybersecurity stocks in the national economy by shifting cybersecurity from individuals and smaller groups to larger companies that can manage attacks.\n\nAny investor looking forward will appreciate the appeal of investing in cybersecurity, a $2 trillion industry, but the best approach to invest is to play it safe and purchase strong buy cybersecurity stocks that offer upside as well.\n\nCyberArk Software (CYBR) CyberArk stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR) manages restricted access, which means locking down accounts with special access to important services; the average price target is $297, up 16% from its current price of $257, and 21 of 22 analysts recommend buying the stock.\n\nIn major news, CYBR is acquiring machine identity management pioneer Venafi to strengthen its identity security platform under a $1.54 billion agreement. CyberArk will integrate Venafi\u2019s technologies onto its platform following the acquisition to improve security.\n\nAlso, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company\u2019s choice of CyberArk\u2019s Identity Security Platform for cloud migration demonstrates the company\u2019s credibility.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, CyberArk hosts its security platform in the UAE to comply with data sovereignty requirements and provide better protection to local customers.\n\nCyberArk also exhibited CORA AI at IMPACT 24, boosting its reputation as a buy cybersecurity stock. New AI-powered features improve identity security in many settings and enhance risk identification and response. Unsurprisingly, given the advancements in the UAE and new AI services, analysts expect big things from CYBR moving forward, with EPS projected to climb 13% and 77%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 and 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter falling 16% this year, Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) is a great bargain with an average price target of $230, meaning a 29% upside.\n\nInvestors think Zscaler\u2019s target markets are saturated and growth halting, as the stock price fell. The company\u2019s fiscal third quarter sales grew 32% to $553.2 million and net income rose 141%, beating Wall Street expectations by double digits. Calculated billings rose 30% and GAAP net income rose from $46 million to $19.1 million. Non-GAAP income grew $139.8 million.\n\nFurthermore, Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Zscaler continue to work on improving zero-trust security through their strategic partnership.

Enterprise data security, threat detection, and response will improve.\n\nThese build on four cybersecurity services from Zscaler launched recently. These services aim to improve its Zero Trust Exchange platform and include Zscaler Risk360, Zero Trust Branch Connectivity, ITDR, and ZSLogin.\n\nZscaler also acquired Avalor Technologies and Airgap Networks to pioneer AI and Zero Trust SASE. ZS\u2019s attractiveness among strong buy cybersecurity stocks is enhanced by these acquisitions, which improve protection services.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is coming off yet another stellar quarter in terms of its earnings, posting solid third-quarter 2024 financial performance, beating consensus projections of $1.25 with $1.32 EPS. Revenue was $1.99 billion, above projections of $1.97 billion, the twelfth time in a row that PANW bested Street estimates; no surprise, PANW has an average price target of roughly $342, indicating a 10% upside potential, not bad among strong buy cybersecurity stocks.\n\nPalo Alto Networks is using AI and machine learning in its cybersecurity products to identify and respond to threats, which will help immensely in making sure PANW can retain its winning streak on the bottom line. This connection intends to provide proactive and automatic security measures, relieving IT staff and boosting security.\n\nPANW has also started a program to help customers switch from old security solutions to the Cortex platform for desktop security.

Instead, you need to compare a stock to something. For SentinelOne, direct competitor CrowdStrike is the perfect comparison. When comparing using the enterprise value (EV)-to-revenue multiple which compares the total valuation of a firm's operations (enterprise value) to the amount of sales generated in a specified period (revenue), the difference is clear (this metric is used for companies with negative or limited profitability).\n\nCompare how much Wall Street is willing to pay for one versus the other, and the gap is jaw-dropping: S EV to Revenues (Forward) Chart\n\nThe gap has never been wider. At nearly a 4-to-1 premium, Wall Street is saying that SentinelOne is utterly inferior to CrowdStrike. SentinelOne's valuation is the lowest it has ever been! In other words, sentiment has never been worse.\n\nI'm not going to deny CrowdStrike's strong fundamentals. The company is profitable (SentinelOne isn't) and larger in size and revenue than SentinelOne, which makes it the leader. SentinelOne faces challenges competing as a smaller company with pockets that aren't as deep. The stock market recognizes this and loudly points it out via CrowdStrike's far more expensive price tag.\n\nSentinelOne's execution is underrated (for now)\n\nBut this is about SentinelOne. What the market is missing here is that SentinelOne isn't some bottom-feeder scraping by. SentinelOne is thriving despite being the underdog to CrowdStrike. For example, revenue grew 40% year over year in the first quarter with tremendous sales momentum coming from SentinelOne's newer products and services.\n\nSentinelOne's data lake platform is growing at a triple-digit percentage rate. That shows that SentinelOne isn't a one-trick pony but a company successfully diversifying into new product categories, which means a larger addressable market. That means more long-term growth opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven more impressive are the financial strides the company made while achieving this growth. In Q1, SentinelOne converted 18% of its revenue to free cash flow, up from minus 24% a year ago. That's a 42-percentage-point jump! In other words, SentinelOne is trending toward becoming profitable very quickly. Maintaining strong revenue growth signals that management is doing this without sacrificing growth and gutting expenses to make the numbers look good.\n\nFrom a product standpoint, SentinelOne delivers top-notch technology. Its platform uses AI to hunt for potential security threats proactively. SentinelOne has also deployed generative AI technology with Purple AI, a ChatGPT-like tool within SentinelOne's platform that helps customers utilize SentinelOne more quickly and easily.\n\nAccording to peer reviews left by Gartner users, SentinelOne and CrowdStrike deliver virtually equivalent product experiences with an average rating of 4.7 and 4.8 stars out of five, respectively.\n\nCan shares really double in six months?\n\nI predicted shares could rise 98% this year, so let's examine how this can happen.\n\nIt's pretty simple.\n\nNothing is guaranteed, of course, but I predict SentinelOne will continue to perform at a high level. Assuming SentinelOne's financials continue improving, the market will realize that SentinelOne will soon become profitable. That massive valuation gap between SentinelOne and CrowdStrike should eventually begin to narrow again.\n\nThe great thing is that SentinelOne can remain far less expensive than CrowdStrike and still produce stellar returns because the company is both cheap and growing quickly. Analysts predict SentinelOne will finish the year with $813 million in revenue. SentinelOne has topped analysts' estimates for every quarter but one since going public, so I expect that figure to be even higher.\n\nUsing that revenue estimate, SentinelOne's valuation could reasonably rise to 12 times its enterprise value-to-sales. The stock traded at this level in January, plus it would still be half of what CrowdStrike is changing hands at. At 12 times its estimated 2024 revenue of $813 million, the stock's resulting enterprise value would be $9.7 billion, or 98% above SentinelOne's current $4.9 billion.\n\nStocks need investor interest to go higher, but such strong fundamentals at a reasonable price look like a home run just waiting to happen.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SentinelOne right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SentinelOne, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SentinelOne wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Up 45% to 226%, Are These 3 Stocks Too Hot to Buy Now?",
        "content": "There's no denying it: The stock market is red-hot. The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average are up about 25%, 31%, and 13%, respectively, over the last 12 months. Many individual stocks are up even more.\n\nBut here's the thing: Touching red-hot items can leave you burned.\n\nSo, is now the time to load up on stocks or to play it cool? This week, a panel of Motley Fool contributors examined three of the hottest stocks on Wall Street: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon is up 45% over the past year. Here's why it could go higher.\n\nJustin Pope (Amazon): Shares of the cloud and e-commerce giant Amazon have surged 45% over the past 12 months, outpacing the S&P 500 by a comfortable margin. But at a time when many stocks have outrun their fundamentals and could face setbacks, Amazon might be ready to take it up a notch.\n\nAmazon's culture is arguably my favorite part of the company. It relentlessly invests profits back into the company to grow, always looking for its next big thing.\n\nThe pandemic juiced demand for e-commerce and digital services, impacting Amazon's core retail and cloud businesses. The company stepped up to the plate and significantly invested in growing its supply chain capacity and cloud capabilities. You can see that Amazon has spent tens of billions of dollars on capital expenditures over the past several years: AMZN Capital Expenditures (TTM) Chart\n\nNow, Amazon is starting to see a return on all that invested capital. Its cash flow from operating the business is at all-time highs, and earnings are poised for a stretch of high-speed growth. Analysts believe the company could grow earnings by an average of 30% annually for three to five years -- meanwhile, shares trade at \"just\" 39 times earnings today. In hindsight, that valuation will look like a bargain if Amazon's earnings growth meets expectations.\n\nOver the years, Amazon has shown it will continue swinging for the fences by investing in itself. Not every Amazon project will be a home run, but long-term investors can comfortably put their money behind a management team like that. Fortunately, you may not need to wait long for the stock to create wealth for shareholders, even if you're relatively new to the stock. The stock's 45% run is remarkable, but the reality is that there could be more to come.\n\nCrowdStrike's run is a cause for celebration and concern\n\nWill Healy(CrowdStrike): Perhaps no cybersecurity stock has benefited more from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom than CrowdStrike. The endpoint security specialist has risen 151% over the last year as it capitalized on the threats and functionality brought by the emerging technology. Amid this increase, the company will become the newest member of the S&P 500 on June 24.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike's Falcon platform has long served as a leader in endpoint security, a segment focused on protecting laptops, smartphones, servers, and other devices.\n\nMoreover, the company offers what it says is the most complete AI-native defense, using the highest-fidelity security data to train its AI models. As such, the more its models train, the better they become at defending customer networks.\n\nCrowdStrike has also maintained growth in an environment where customers increasingly deal with just one cybersecurity vendor. Its management said on the fiscal Q1 2025 (ended April 30) earnings call that 65% of its customers have purchased five or more of its modules. Also, deals involving eight or more modules rose 95% in the quarter, a factor that could indicate its market share is rising.\n\nThe question for prospective buyers is whether they waited too long to buy the stock. Revenue in fiscal Q1 grew 33% yearly to $921 million, slower than the 36% increase in fiscal 2024. Also, if fiscal 2025 revenue comes in at the midpoint of the forecast $3.97 billion to $4.01 billion, it will slow to 30%.\n\nThat slowdown in revenue growth may prompt investors to question its elevated sales multiple. CrowdStrike's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is now 29, well above the average P/S ratio of 20 over the last year and approximately 10 times the average 2.9 sales multiple for the S&P 500. Such valuations increase the danger of a pullback in the stock.\n\nAdmittedly, a high P/S ratio does not undermine its longer-term bull thesis. Nonetheless, investors should probably hold out for a lower sales multiple before putting more money to work in CrowdStrike.\n\nNvidia has climbed the mountain and is now the world's most valuable company\n\nJake Lerch (Nvidia): Up 226% over the last 12 months, Nvidia's recent rise will go down in history. The company recently surpassed Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company, with a market cap topping $3.4 trillion.\n\nYet, for many investors, the question has to be whether Nvidia's rally can go on. Can a stock that has already risen more than 10x in less than two years really be a smart long-term investment?\n\nTo answer this question, you have to dig into the numbers -- and they're eye-popping.\n\nLet's start with Nvidia's revenue. The company's trailing-12-month sales more than tripled from a low of $26 billion to almost $80 billion. What's more, revenue estimates continue to skyrocket. For Nvidia's current fiscal year (which ends on Jan. 28, 2025), analysts predict $120 billion; sales estimates rise to $160 billion the following year. In short, Wall Street expects the company's 2026 sales total to be roughly 6x its 2022 total.\n\nSo, despite the company's impressive revenue and lofty estimates of its future revenue, Nvidia's stock is still running ahead of the numbers. This is easy to see if you look at the stock's forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which is nearing its all-time high of 46x. NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nYet, while the stock's high valuation is notable, it doesn't mean that Nvidia isn't a great long-term investment. Remember, the reason the company's sales are soaring is because Nvidia's products are the most sought after hardware globally. They are helping shape the cutting-edge technology that is powering the AI revolution.\n\nIf you believe AI is the technology that will dominate the next 10 to 20 years, investing in Nvidia today -- even with its high valuation -- still makes sense.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "CrowdStrike Stock Is Getting Added to the S&amp;P 500. But This Other New S&amp;P 500 Addition Could Be a Better Bargain Buy.",
        "content": "The S&P 500 index is a well-known benchmark composed of roughly 500 stocks that are U.S. companies, big, and profitable. Cloud-based cybersecurity company CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) will be included starting on June 24. And this company has absolutely earned the honor of inclusion.\n\nCrowdStrike went public in 2019. And during the company's fiscal 2019 (which ended in January of that year), it generated revenue of just $250 million. Fast forward to fiscal 2024 (which ended in January of this year), and it generated revenue of over $3 billion. In short, CrowdStrike has grown by an extraordinary amount in just five years as a public company.\n\nThe quality of CrowdStrike's growth is also noteworthy. There are companies that have grown by a comparable amount, but few have also simultaneously unlocked massive profitability. Free cash flow has skyrocketed. And in its fiscal first quarter of 2025, CrowdStrike achieved a huge free-cash-flow margin of 35% -- that's incredible.\n\nHowever, one could nitpick CrowdStrike as an investment due to its lofty valuation. Overpaying for an investment -- even for shares of a great business -- can negatively impact future returns. And trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of nearly 30 and a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of nearly 100, CrowdStrike stock is expensive today. CRWD PS Ratio Chart\n\nTo be fair, it may still work out for investors. The cybersecurity space is an enormous opportunity and CrowdStrike is one of the best players. Therefore, its long-term growth and profits may justify its valuation.\n\nHowever, for investors concerned about this valuation risk today, website company GoDaddy(NYSE: GDDY) is getting included in the S&P 500 alongside CrowdStrike. And it's a much better bargain buy today, as I'll explain.\n\nWhy investors should look at GoDaddy stock\n\nOver the last three years, shares of GoDaddy are quietly up about 60%, which is almost double the 31% return for the S&P 500. And when investors consider the material things that make stocks go up, GoDaddy stock is rising for the right reasons.\n\nFor starters, GoDaddy continues growing even though it's been around a long time. In 2022, the company's revenue was up 7% year over year, and it was up 4% in 2023. Then in the first quarter of 2024, revenue grew by another 7% compared to the prior-year period.\n\nSome investors might scoff at a single-digit growth rate for GoDaddy. And in isolation, it's true that the company's revenue growth didn't move the needle much. But its free cash flow has fared much better because of where the growth is coming from -- more on that in a moment. Consider that free-cash-flow growth exceeded revenue growth in 2022, 2023, and in Q1, which is a solid trend at this point.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, thanks to using its cash flow to buy back stock, GoDaddy has reduced its share count, which boosts its free cash flow per share. This is important for individual shareholders because their ownership stakes are thereby getting more valuable.\n\nIn summary, GoDaddy reduced its share count, grew its revenue, and grew its free cash flow. And its free cash flow per share went up faster than its stock price, which means its recent market-beating performance is justified. GDDY Chart\n\nThe real question for investors today is whether GoDaddy can continue growing revenue and free cash flow while reducing its share count. And I believe the answer is \"yes.\"\n\nGoDaddy makes most of its money with domain name services -- this is its top-of-mind service, and 92% of its customers in 2023 bought a domain name from the company. However, GoDaddy increasingly offers services for starting, growing, and marketing a business, including with products for building websites, accepting payments, and more.\n\nThese complementary products are no-brainers for GoDaddy and have boosted profit margins -- this explains why free cash flow is growing faster than revenue. And the company's recent artificial intelligence (AI) tools are further boosting the adoption of its newer products, according to management.\n\nAs a result, GoDaddy expects free-cash-flow growth to keep outpacing revenue growth. Management expects to generate $4.5 billion cumulative free cash flow through the end of 2026. Moreover, management is still authorized to repurchase $1.1 billion in shares as of the end of Q1, to further reduce the share count.\n\nTrading at just 20 times its free cash flow, GoDaddy stock is a far better bargain than CrowdStrike stock, as the chart below shows. CRWD Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nIt's not as exciting or as high-growth as CrowdStrike. But GoDaddy is growing its free cash flow at a respectable rate, and the valuation is quite reasonable. This combination of profitable growth and fairly priced shares could yield strong stock returns from here, which is why I believe investors should give GoDaddy stock a hard look now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in GoDaddy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in GoDaddy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and GoDaddy wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Defying the Norms: 3 High P/E Stocks With Room to Run",
        "content": "One method of identifying which stocks to buy is to find those with price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios below their industry peers or historical averages. A low P/E suggests the stock possesses underlying worth that is not fully reflected in its current price. The logical next move is to take the price towards the \u201chigh\u201d at which the trader intends to sell.\r\n\r\nWith stock indices reaching record highs in quick succession, locating low P/E opportunities has proven difficult in today\u2019s markets. Equally frustrating is that several stocks rising substantially, defined as \u201chigh\u201d, have continued ascending further. Although buying stocks with high P/E ratios defies the norms, identifying those with meaningful growth potential might be a good strategy in this context.\n\nA recent example garnering endless coverage is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). It has maintained an upward trajectory to become the world\u2019s most valuable company. Exclusively looking for low P/E bargains has probably caused many traders to miss out on the profitable rally. However, finding which high P/E stocks to buy is not an easy task.\n\nThe following three high P/E stocks have valuations that do not necessarily preclude the prospect of further price appreciation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGilead Sciences (GILD) A Gilead Sciences (GILD) sign at the company headquarters in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite its norm-defying nature, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) may be one of the high P/E stocks to buy. Typically, companies attain a high P/E ratio after their share price increases faster than earnings. However, Gilead has not performed like other high P/E ratio stocks.\n\nGILD stock has fallen 22% year-to-date (YTD), yet it maintains a high P/E of 175x as investors react to lawsuits involving its key HIV drug profits. Litigation can make investors cautious, but settlements are nearing completion, potentially allowing prior growth to resume.\r\n\r\nOne reason Gilead may surprise among high P/E stocks is its recent progress on a weight-loss drug, a lucrative area for pharma. According to Goldman Sachs, the weight-loss industry could reach $100 billion by the end of the decade, and Gilead may have just developed a rival weight-loss pill pending review later this month.\n\nAnalysts unanimously view the stock positively and expect a rise from current levels. The average price target stands at $81.21 per share, representing nearly 30% upside. Growth estimates for Gilead for his quarter lie at 17.90%, which is over twice the S&P 500\u2019s 8.30%.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is another choice in this list of high p/e stocks to buy due to its leadership in the growing cybersecurity industry. As artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities expand with technologies like ChatGPT, digital security concerns have increased. Crowdstrike\u2019s leadership in cybersecurity appears poised to deliver continued growth for investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has benefited from the growing need to protect assets, with spending on security expected to rise double-digit for years. Unsurprisingly, the CRWD stock has increased 266% in the past year. However, earnings have not kept pace with this growth, though revenue rose solidly at 33%. Still, the stock trades at a high P/E ratio of 708x.\r\n\r\nTwo factors could further support an increase in Crowdstrike\u2019s share price. First, it will join the S&P 500 index next week, allowing new investors to buy the high-p/e stock. Still, growth estimates for this and next year remain over 20%. Second, analysts remain broadly positive, with 94% recommending a buy and the remainder suggesting a hold.\n\nDataDog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) is the final pick in this high P/E stocks to buy list. The diversified enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) company allows users to monitor cloud infrastructure and system performance metrics. With AI requiring significant server capacity, which must be monitored, DataDog may have more room to run.\n\nThe company has grown revenue by approximately 50% annually over the past three years and expects continued growth. Notably, Datadog has a history of exceeding estimates consistently. Over the last few quarters, it has surprised analysts with an over 25% beat. However, recent leadership changes have increased investor uncertainty, resulting in underperformance and a high P/E ratio of 342x.\r\n\r\nDataDog recently launched an enhanced product for clients. While investors have been cautious, analysts remain positive on the outlook of the company, agreeing with management that sales should grow around 25% annually.

        "content": "Finding attractive stocks in the financial markets is essential for investors trying to take advantage of expansion prospects. Seven stocks are among the most inexpensive to purchase and keep. These companies are on the cusp on cutting-edge processors, social media and artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductor technology, financial services disruption, cybersecurity solutions leadership, big data analytics specialization and audio streaming dominance.\n\nThese businesses are at the top of their respective industries and setting new standards for innovation and profitability. Examining these companies\u2019 fundamentals, like business practices, competitive positioning and game-changing technology, will help one understand why these stocks are considered excellent investments. Whether it\u2019s how their processors are changing computing environments, their AI-driven digital ecosystem is growing or their deliberate focus on AI and data center advances, each firm provides solid arguments for investors looking for the best cheap stocks to purchase and keep.\n\nHere, the emphasis is on what distinguishes these businesses from the competition in the current market by highlighting critical elements that determine their potential and growth paths.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) designs and produces computer processors and related technologies. Sales in the client category reached $1.4 billion, up 85% from the previous year. Ryzen desktop and mobile CPUs are in high demand, and partners like HP (NYSE:HPQ) have been major adopters of these processors in business PCs. AMD\u2019s client business has grown impressively as well, thanks in part to Ryzen CPUs. Additionally, strong market acceptance and adoption of Ryzen 8000 series CPUs across desktop and mobile platforms reflect the 85% rise in revenue.\n\nIndeed, with its AI accelerators and improved security features, the Ryzen Pro portfolio is designed with industry demands in mind. It has garnered popularity among commercial PC makers, putting AMD in a solid position to take market share in\u00a0the enterprise PC space. Despite obstacles, particularly in the embedded area, advances in edge AI present significant potential. To sum up, AMD\u2019s Ryzen processors have gained significant market acceptance in both consumer and commercial segments. These elements make AMD an ideal pick among the top undervalued stocks to buy and hold.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nMetaPlatforms (NASDAQ:META) operates the largest social media network globally, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. With $36.5 billion in total sales in Q1 2024, Meta recorded a 27% year-over-year (YoY) rise in revenue. Its Family of Apps category contributes significantly to ad income and is the primary driver of this increase. In particular, the segment\u2019s ad income increased by 27% to $35.6 billion compared to the previous year. Moreover, Meta\u2019s worldwide revenue diversification strategy\u00a0is seen\u00a0in the multiple revenue streams across several geographic regions, with major gains in Europe (33% growth) and the Rest of the World (40% growth).\n\nFurther, with its Meta AI driven by the Llama 3 model, Meta has achieved significant advancements in AI research. This AI assistant is compatible with all of its social media platforms, including Messenger. These developments improve the user experience. They also set the stage for future revenue generation via targeted advertising and user engagement.\n\nTo conclude, Meta\u2019s investments in AI and\u00a0virtual reality (VR) technologies enhance user engagement and broaden its revenue streams, making it an attractive choice on the undervalued stocks to buy and hold list.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a leader in semiconductor manufacturing, designing and microprocessor production for various computing devices. Over $2.1 billion was added to its operational profit year over year, bringing its operating margin to over 28% (Q1 2024). Despite sales issues, Intel Foundry is making attempts to enhance profitability. Intel\u2019s operating profit decreased somewhat from the previous year. However, it may increase as the firm moves to more sophisticated nodes and improves factory utilization.\n\nAdditionally, high achievements include the commencement of Intel 20A manufacturing. The launch of Intel 14A utilizes high NA EUV technology. Intel\u2019s position in the AI and data center sectors is strengthened by product launches such as the Intel Gaudi 3 AI accelerator. It promises\u00a040% more efficiency and 50% quicker inference than competitors. Even with a $6.2 billion negative adjusted free cash flow, Intel is confident in its improvements, as good cost control and higher-than-expected gross margins contributed to an EPS that exceeded forecast.\n\nOverall, Intel\u2019s advancements in processor technologies and strategic investments in foundry capabilities position it as a key pick on the undervalued stocks to buy and hold list.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) offers financial services and mobile payment solutions through its flagship app. Even though Block devotes less than\u00a03% of its resources\u00a0to Bitcoin (BTC-USD) related initiatives, its\u00a0products are now a significant source of income. With very little in associated costs (0.7%) , Cash App\u2019s bitcoin goods contributed 3.3% and\u00a04.2% of Block\u2019s gross profit in 2022 and 2023, respectively. This high-margin industry uses Block\u2019s platform to generate extra income.\n\nMoreover, Block has expanded the range of products it offers, such as Cash App Borrow, Cash App Card, and Buy Now, Pay Later, all of which help to drive the company\u2019s revenue growth. The growth of ecosystem components like Paid in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Roundups increase user adoption and engagement and generates more money. Block\u2019s TBD project intends to create a system for fiat-to-digital currency exchanges to upend the $860 billion global remittance market. Hence, this program takes advantage of a huge market opportunity and supports Square\u2019s objective of democratizing financial access everywhere.\n\nTo sum up, Block\u2019s disruptive approach to financial services and expansion into cryptocurrency and digital payments make it an appealing choice for undervalued stocks to buy and hold.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) provides cybersecurity solutions through its Falcon platform, which leverages AI and cloud technologies. The design of the Falcon platform\u00a0is emphasized as a competitive moat that facilitates cybersecurity solution consolidation. Customers experience less complexity due to this consolidation, improving operational effectiveness and security. Customers who adopt several modules do so at significant rates: 65% adopt five or more modules, 44% adopt six or more, and 28% adopt seven or more modules. The platform\u2019s stickiness and range of capabilities in meeting various cybersecurity demands are shown by its modular adoption.\n\nMoreover, partnerships with major players in the market confirm Crowdstrike\u2019s leadership in supplying cybersecurity solutions for cloud settings while improving product offerings. The speedy release of new solutions like Falcon for Defender and upgrades such as Falcon Cloud Security and\u00a0Falcon Next-Gen SIEM showcase Crowdstrike\u2019s adaptability and market response. Finally, Crowdstrike\u2019s robust growth in revenue and profitability and strong customer retention rates make it one of the undervalued stocks to buy and hold.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) specializes in big data analytics software, serving government agencies and large enterprises. The business recruited 41 net new clients in Q1 2024 alone in the U.S. commercial market, indicating a 69% YoY and 19% sequential growth. The business signed a seven-figure agreement five days after finishing a bootcamp with a utility provider, demonstrating a notable deal cycle shortening. Current clients are growing in size and the influence of their deployments. Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW) and General Mills (NYSE:GIS) are two examples of companies doing this.\n\nFurther, adjusted operating margin rose to\u00a057% in Q1 2024.\u00a0This\u00a0indicates a balanced growth trajectory with concurrent adjusted operating margins and revenue growth increases. The company produced $149 million in adjusted free cash flow \u2014 a 23% margin reflects sharp cash management and operational edge. Adjusted expenditures grew by just 2% annually and sequentially, despite growth, highlighting strict cost management. In short, Palantir\u2019s strategic contracts and consistent profitability make it an intriguing pick on the undervalued stocks to buy and hold list.\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display.

The company reached a record-breaking Q1 2024 gross margin of 27.6%, an increase of 2.43% from the previous year. Favorable content costs and other operational efficiencies were the main drivers of this development, delivering a record-breaking operating income of 168 million euros.\u00a0This\u00a0indicates Spotify\u2019s progress toward meeting its financial goals. Spotify was able to offset the impact of higher-than-expected social charge accruals by controlling costs and reducing operational expenditures.\n\nMoreover, Spotify produced a positive\u00a0207 million euros in free cash flow during the first quarter, demonstrating excellent operational cash production capabilities. Spotify must maintain this positive cash flow position to fortify its financial position and reinvest in its expansion plans. It had 4.7 billion euros in short-term investments and cash in Q1 2024. Thanks to its strong liquidity, Spotify has the financial flexibility to fund its current operations and strategic initiatives.\n\nFinally, Spotify\u2019s focus on expanding its content library, enhancing the user experience through personalized recommendations and diversifying revenue streams through new features solidifies its presence on the undervalued stocks to buy and hold list.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in AMD, META, INTC and PLTR.

They\u2019ve since fallen off a little.\n\nIf you\u2019re a dividend investor, it increased the quarterly payout by 16% to 50 cents. The annual rate of $2.00 yields 0.53%. It\u2019s the 25th annual increase, which should make it a Dividend Aristocrat. It\u2019s important to remember that, among stocks to buy, it\u2019s the growth that counts, not the yield.\n\nAs far as I know, there isn\u2019t a convenience store operator in the index.\n\nApollo Global Management (APO) Apollo Global Management logo on website. APO stock.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock\n\nApollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) was founded in 1990 and went public in 2011. Its shares appreciated by 552% in the 13 years since. Its market cap is over $70 billion. There are 129 companies in the index with a higher market cap.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrently, only one alternative asset manager is in the index. That would be Blackstone (NYSE:BX) with a $149 billion market cap. KKR\u2019s got a $98 billion market cap and a more storied history than Apollo. As a result, it may be a while before APO is included in the index.\n\nHowever, analysts generally like it. Of the 17 that cover it, 11 rate it a \u201cbuy,\u201d with a $126 target price, 7% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\nEarlier in June, Apollo struck a deal to buy into Intel\u2019s (NASDAQ:INTC) Fab 34 facility in Ireland. It will pay $11 billion for 49% of the joint venture. Intel will retain 51% control. Intel\u2019s already spent $18.4 billion on the facility.\n\nApollo finished its latest quarter with $65 billion in dry powder, the industry term for funds left to be invested.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) headquarters\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) was founded in 2003 by CEO Alex Karp and venture capitalist Peter Thiel. It went public in September 2020 using a direct listing. Its shares have appreciated 158% in the four years since. Its market cap is over $57 billion. There are 157 companies in the index with a higher market cap.\n\nMost of Palantir\u2019s gains have come since the beginning of 2023 when its share price bottomed around $6.25. The gains are primarily because of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which it launched in April 2023. In its press release from April 7th, 2023, CEO Alex Karp stated:\n\n\u201cAIP will allow customers to leverage the power of our existing machine learning technologies alongside the increasingly sophisticated natural language processing capabilities of the newest large language models, directly in our existing platforms, including Foundry and Gotham, which are now home to some of the most valuable privately held and industry specific data repositories in the world.\u201d\n\nFast forward to June 2024 \u2014 its AI business is on fire.\n\nOn June 17, Argus Research analyst Joseph Bonner initiated coverage of PLTR stock, giving it a \u201cbuy\u201d rating with a $29 target price, well above where it\u2019s currently trading. Bonner expects Palantir\u2019s earnings to grow 19% annually over the next five years.\n\nThat makes it more than eligible for the index.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The market is on an incredible bull run. Since the fall of 2022, growth and technology stocks have been going virtually straight up.\n\nAnd, fundamentally, there\u2019s a solid reason for that. We are seeing real breakthroughs in fields such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence right now. While it\u2019s still early in this new technology paradigm, it\u2019s already becoming apparent that fortunes are being made riding this wave.\n\nThat said, a growth stock boom isn\u2019t a good excuse to buy all technology companies indiscriminately. While many companies are enjoying strong fundamentals at the moment, other firms look more like tech pretenders than future champions. These three overrated stocks to sell have seen their valuations run far ahead of the underlying fair value of their respective businesses.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a semiconductor company with a variety of chip operations. The company is most well-known for its System-on-a-Chip architectures along with Ethernet solutions, electro-optical products and custom application specific integrated circuits.\n\nWhile Marvell is a broadly-diversified semiconductor company, its AI\u00a0product offerings are driving the conversation right now. Marvell makes a point of highlighting its partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its focus on delivering AI infrastructure for the AI Era.\n\nMRVL stock has jumped from around $40 in early 2023 to more than $70 per share now on the expectations that these AI strategies will turn into profits.\n\nSo far, this simply hasn\u2019t happened. In fact, the company\u2019s recent Q1 earnings report was a fiasco. The company reported merely in-line results, whereas traders had been hoping that the AI buzz would turn into a big earnings beat.\n\nMaking matters worse, Marvell somehow reported a 12% year-over-year decline in revenues despite all the AI hype. At some point, Marvell\u2019s AI business may start to catch on with customers. But with the stock at 50 times forward earnings, investors are paying a high price for this possibility.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) used to be at the forefront of major trends in consumer electronics hardware. Traders rushed to own Dell shares back in the dot-com era thanks to the company\u2019s promise.\n\nBut that magic wore off many years ago. More recently, Dell has been a slower-moving consumer electronics and IT vendor. These sorts of companies generally earn low valuations. While a cash cow business has value, the lack of growth tends to limit excitement.\n\nStory continues\n\nTraders have given DELL stock a fresh look over the past year, however. Shares are up more than 200% over the past 12 months. This comes thanks to Dell\u2019s push into selling AI-enabled servers and hardware.\n\nThere is rapid growth here, and Dell is seeing real momentum for the first time in a while. But there is a major red flag here. Profitability on server sales appears to be underwhelming. Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, in a cautious research piece noted that there are: \u201cconcerns that AI servers are being sold at near-zero margins.\u201d Dell can sell plenty of AI-hardware, but it remains to be seen if it has a competitive moat to earn sizable profits on this business.\n\nSacconaghi isn\u2019t the only analyst with questions. Morningstar\u2019s William Kerwin sees more than\u00a050% downside for DELL stock, as he believes fair value is merely $65 per share.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leading cybersecurity company. It offers a cloud-based suite of solutions for protecting endpoints, workloads, user identity and data.\n\nCrowdStrike has been an incredible growth story. It has increased its revenues from $481 million in fiscal year 2020 to $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2024. There\u2019s no disputing that track record of success, and its industry has considerable growth drivers as well.\n\nHowever, the company is only modestly profitable. Shares are trading at around 100 times estimated adjusted fiscal year 2025 earnings. Making matters worse, excluding those adjustments, the company is trading at a shocking 725 times GAAP trailing earnings.\n\nIf CrowdStrike could keep up its stratospheric revenue growth rate, maybe it could grow into this valuation within a reasonable timespan. However, as the company grows, its revenue growth rate is trailing off, with analysts seeing it drop to the mid-20s annually in fiscal year 2026. Rising competition within the industry threatens to further slow growth rates, pressure pricing and increase customer churn.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Most millionaires reach that level of wealth by investing their cash into profitable assets. Investments allow your money to work for you, and the growth becomes more pronounced once you get past the first $100,000.\n\nThat milestone is the hardest part about being a millionaire. That\u2019s because of how percentages work. If your $10,000 portfolio goes up by 10%, you only have $11,000. That\u2019s still better than nothing, but if you generate that same return on a $500,000 portfolio, your portfolio will gain an additional $50,000.\n\nBoth scenarios demonstrate what happens with a 10% return, but one portfolio generated an additional $50,000 while the smaller portfolio only brought in $1,000. Buying growth stocks with exceptional returns can help you reach your financial goals sooner. Combine that with regular investments, and it\u2019s possible to reach a 7-figure portfolio. Investors with that objective may want to look closely at these seven growth stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been a top cybersecurity player for several years, but its recent inclusion in the S&P 500 has brought more attention to the outperformer. The stock is up by 58% year-to-date and has gained 440% over the past five years.\n\nCrowdstrike continues to report robust revenue growth, while other cybersecurity companies are experiencing growth deceleration due to industrial headwinds. This context makes Crowdstrike\u2019s 33% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 FY25 even more impressive. Net income also expanded in the quarter, going from $0.5 million to $42.8 million year-over-year.\n\nThe company\u2019s business model indicates that more gains are likely. Most of Crowdstrike\u2019s revenue is recurring, and it closed out the quarter with $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue. That includes $211.7 million in net new recurring yearly revenue added in the quarter. Cybersecurity is a booming industry that becomes more important every year, and Crowdstrike is leading the pack.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nDeckersOutdoor (NYSE:DECK) has gained market share in the athletic apparel industry. At the same time, corporate heavyweights like Nike (NYSE:NKE) are losing ground. Deckers Outdoor continues to march forward with its UGG and HOKA brands.\n\nIt\u2019s another recent addition to the S&P 500 that has been crushing the stock market. Shares are up by 51% year-to-date and have gained 480% over the past five years. Deckers Outdoor is valued at $26 billion and trades at a 35 P/E ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe athletic apparel company reported solid results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue increased by 21.2% year-over-year in the quarter and was up by 18% for the year. The HOKA brand made up more than half of total sales and was up by 34.0% year-over-year. UGG sales were up by 14.9% year-over-year, reaching $361.3 million.\n\nDeckers Outdoor is growing in both the domestic and international markets. Domestic sales increased by 19.4% year over year, while international sales were up by 25.2% year over year. Strong growth in both markets points to more runway for the stock.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) helps millions of people learn new languages. The educational tech company has also recently expanded to offer lessons in various subjects, like math and music. More than 31.4 million people use Duolingo every day. Duolingo cited the 54% year-over-year increase to a record number of net daily user additions. The surge in daily active users contributed to the company\u2019s 45% year-over-year revenue growth. Duolingo reported $167.6 million in total revenue compared to $27.0 million in net income.\n\nDuolingo now exhibits double-digit profit margins after burning through cash just a year ago. The net profit margin came in at 16.1% this quarter. Shares are up by more than 40% over the past year, including a 19% gain over the past month. Duolingo looks ready to rally, and rising profits will make the valuation more reasonable for long-term investors. The company is currently valued at $9 billion.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Explore the stock market trends for 2024 with analytical visuals of businessman planning long term investments and future business growth, Navigate towards success with smart strategies. growth stocks with millionaire potential\n\nSource: Thapana_Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is the search engine marketing tool of choice for many freelancers and businesses. The platform makes it easier to discover good keywords, run successful ad campaigns, and monitor the competition.\n\nMany businesses compete for the top search results on Google, Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) child company. Some small businesses make millions of dollars each year by ranking at the top of Google\u2019s search results for the right keywords. Companies will look for any competitive edge to increase their chances of showing up on Google, and Semrush has helped many businesses.\n\nThe digital marketing tool has 112,000 paying customers, up by 10% year-over-year. Semrush is also doing a great job getting customers to upgrade their subscriptions. Even though the paying customer base only increased by 10% year-over-year, revenue was up by 21% year-over-year. Semrush also generated a profit of $2.1 million during the quarter. Semrush also has 1.13 million registered free active customers. This figure is up by 27% year-over-year and presents additional revenue growth opportunities. Most of Semrush\u2019s revenue is recurring, translating into steady growth.\n\nUpwork (UPWK) The logo for Upwork (UPWK) is displayed on a cellphone.\n\nSource: Funstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nUpwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) hasn\u2019t had the best stretch. It\u2019s down by 28% year-to-date and over 80% from its peak. However, the tide appears to be shifting for Upwork. The company is only valued at $1.4 billion and trades at a 30 P/E ratio. That P/E ratio is reasonable for a leader in the remote work industry with rising revenue and earnings.\n\nThe remote work marketplace reported 19% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter 2024. While revenue reached $190.9 million, net income reached $18.4 million, a 7% year-over-year improvement. Upwork presents growth at a reasonable price, and if growth surges, the current price can look like a bargain.\n\nWhile remote work continues to attract more attention, Upwork\u2019s advertising segment also presents a compelling opportunity. Upwork\u2019s ads and monetization products segment grew by 93% year over year and is the company\u2019s fastest-growing revenue stream. Freelancer Plus exceeded 100,000 active subscriptions and was up by 76% year over year. Continued growth in these revenue streams can help Upwork regain positive momentum and deliver solid gains.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) continues to march higher. It\u2019s up by 50% year-to-date as a 50-for-1 stock split looms for the fast food restaurant chain. Chipotle\u2019s healthier food options have given it more pricing power. Despite multiple price hikes, customers come through Chipotle\u2019s doors in droves and continue to elevate the company\u2019s financials.\n\nChipotle reported 14.1% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter, fueled by a 7.0% year-over-year increase in comparable restaurant sales growth. Net income remained elevated by 23.2% year-over-year, resulting in a 13.3% net profit margin.\n\nWhile the stock gains have been impressive for several years, more growth is on the menu. Chipotle opened up 47 new restaurants in the quarter and remains on pace for 285-315 new restaurants this year. New restaurant openings allow Chipotle to deliver higher revenue growth since it can reach customers in more locations. Reducing how far people drive to arrive at a Chipotle can also increase how often its most loyal customers buy food from one of its restaurants.\n\nSoFi (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) has been a tough hold for long-term investors. Shares are down by more than 30% year-to-date and 38% over the past five years. Additionally, the stock is more than 70% removed from its all-time high.\n\nDespite this context, SoFi looks like it\u2019s on the verge of outperforming the stock market. The digital bank reported 37% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 2024 and net income of $88.0 million. SoFi\u2019s profits are notable since the fintech firm reported a net loss of $34.4 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nSoFi\u2019s financial products are picking up momentum. It offers bank accounts, loans, credit cards, investment portfolios, and other resources for its 8.1 million members. SoFi CEO Anthony Noto has been capitalizing on the lower price of SoFi stock. He recently purchased $199,000 worth of SoFi stock and now has 8.12 million shares in the company. It\u2019s usually a good sign when the CEO is buying more shares of his own company.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CRWD, DECK, and SOFI.

        "title": "3 AI Stock Underdogs Flying Below the Radar for Now",
        "content": "It\u2019s hard to tell just how long the AI boom will last. Even as headlines begin using the word \u201cbubble,\u201d I\u2019m not convinced that a big chunk of the tech scene is due for a horrid collapse in value, especially if AI bets start producing a bit of return or, in the case of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a massive return that exceeded estimates of many raging bulls on Wall Street.\n\nAt this juncture, it seems too risky to chase the hottest AI stocks after recent sizeable moves. At the same time, investors also stand to miss upside surges by timing their exits too prematurely in the companies that view the AI boom as a long-lived secular growth driver rather than a short-lived boost that\u2019ll end in tears. There are risks on both sides, to the upside and downside.\n\nIn any case, the AI underdogs may be worth looking into if you seek value and long-term AI upside. Some of the following AI underdogs have also been (mostly) left out of the latest year-to-date rally.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle (EV) maker first and foremost, and the stock certainly seems to reflect such as auto deliveries roll sharply lower. That said, TSLA stock may have lost a bit of its tech premium amid the latest rampant sell-off.\n\nUndoubtedly, Tesla can be a tough stock to value, given that it has several impressive innovations that could move the needle on growth in the long term. Indeed, fully autonomous vehicles and the rise of robotaxis may be seen as a potential \u201cwild card\u201d by many investors. However, self-driving capabilities are not where Tesla\u2019s AI prowess ends.\n\nThe company\u2019s Optimus Gen 2 robot has received praise from Elon Musk of late. Next year could be a big year for the humanoid robot as more of them find work at Tesla\u2019s factories. As AI takes more of a physical form in the next 10 years, perhaps Tesla is best equipped to benefit.\n\nUndoubtedly, incorporating humanoid robots could help reduce labor costs and allow the EV giant more flexibility to reduce EV costs to be more competitive with up-and-coming rivals in the U.S. and China. Are too many investors getting caught up in the auto dip and missing out on the longer-term AI-driven narrative? Time will tell.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock certainly seems like more of a value trap than a cheap AI play that investors may have taken the wrong way. At writing, INTC stock is down close to 40% from its 52-week highs. With enthusiasm over Intel\u2019s comeback all but evaporated, questions linger as to how the fallen chip stock can win back shareholders, many of whom may have gone for the likes of Nvidia. Why settle for an underdog when Nvidia, the world\u2019s new largest company, looks virtually untouchable?\n\nStory continues\n\nUndoubtedly, Intel needs more than just a turnaround plan. It needs to execute and prove that it has more than just a puncher\u2019s chance to return to the conversation with today\u2019s AI chip leaders. Arguably, Intel needs to punch well above estimates to give investors confidence in the firm\u2019s AI footing.\n\nThough CEO Pat Gelsinger is a wonderful manager, there\u2019s concern that the market leaders, like Nvidia, are just moving way too fast, giving laggards next to no opportunity to play catch-up.\n\nWhile Intel is being aggressive with spend (investors seem off-put by rising costs), the company still seems like the \u201cbiggest head-scratcher in tech,\u201d as Wedbush Securities\u2019 Dan Ives put it.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a top-notch cybersecurity company that\u2019s hovering close to all-time highs, just shy of $400 per share. Indeed, every major cyber threat that hits the headlines can be viewed as rallying fuel for cybersecurity stocks. As cyber threats grow even more dangerous with generative AI at their side, there has never been a worse time to cut back on cybersecurity-related spending.\n\nGiven the pace of AI innovation, I\u2019d argue the cybersecurity industry has timely enough tailwinds to bring forth even more upside. Further, we\u2019re probably entering an era where it\u2019s no longer sufficient to go with just any cybersecurity firm. To maximize protection, firms will need modern cybersecurity firms that are firmly grounded in the AI age.\n\nYou need to know AI to be able to fight off AI, after all.\n\nWith Charlotte AI, generative AI for the good guys, CrowdStrike may have the means to take further market share as it leverages AI in a way to expand the gap with industry rivals. As Charlotte AI advances its impressive multi-AI architecture, I view Crowdstrike as having the means to charge more as enterprises strive to get the most advanced AI-leveraging cybersecurity platform possible to prevent the nightmarish kinds of breaches we\u2019ve witnessed in recent years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "CrowdStrike CRWD recently collaborated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE to integrate HPE GreenLake and OpsRamp AIOps with its Falcon cybersecurity platform.\n\nThis collaboration allows CRWD's customers to benefit from a unified cloud-based platform that integrates artificial intelligence into their IT infrastructure while also providing robust cybersecurity features.\n\nThe OpsRamp platform focuses on enabling businesses to simplify the design, development, testing and deployment of AI applications. HPE GreenLake, on the other hand, brings cloud-like flexibility to data centers and endpoints.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s collaboration with HPE will allow CRWD\u2019s customers to monitor and automate tasks for systems that use NVIDIA\u2019s NVDA end-to-end accelerated computing stack, including NVIDIA NIM and AI software, NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs and AI clusters. Moreover, enterprises will now be able to leverage HPE GreenLake to fast-track the adoption of generative AI in their endpoints, datacenter and cloud.\n\nCrowdStrike is riding on a strong and innovative portfolio with the growing adoption of its Falcon platform. Shares of the company have rallied 52.5% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Internet Software industry\u2019s growth of 12%.\n\nCrowdStrike Price and Consensus\n\nCrowdStrike price-consensus-chart | CrowdStrike Quote\n\nEnhancing Product Capabilities Through Partnerships\n\nCrowdStrike has partnered with a number of industry giants, including Cloudflare NET and NVIDIA, to enhance its product capabilities.\n\nThe partnership between CrowdStrike and Cloudflare was focused on integrating Cloudflare One Zero Trust protection solution and CRWD\u2019s Falcon Next-Gen SIEM to improve the security of their joint channel partners.\n\nCRWD also merged its Falcon platform data with NVIDIA's GPU-optimized AI pipelines and NVIDIA NIM microservices, enabling their shared customers to seamlessly create custom and secure generative AI models.\n\nWith a rising number of crucial partnerships, client base and deepened product portfolio, CrowdStrike is on a strong growth trajectory and that is reflected in the company\u2019s last four earnings. The company\u2019s non-GAAP earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 15.8%.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, CRWD expects revenues between $3,976.3 million and $4,010.7 million. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $4 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 30.8%.\n\nNon-GAAP earnings for 2025 are anticipated in the band of $3.93-$4.03 per share. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 non-GAAP earnings is pegged at $3.98 cents per share, suggesting growth of 28.8% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s diversified product portfolio, strong partner base and expanding clientele make it an important player in this sphere. These strengths, coupled with its solid financial performance, position CRWD as a promising opportunity for long-term growth.\n\nDespite its strengths, CrowdStrike\u2019s near-term prospects might be hurt by softening IT spendings. The still-high interest rates and protracted inflationary conditions have impacted consumer spending. Meanwhile, enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues.\n\nSome of the cybersecurity players have already pointed out that organizations are delaying or taking more time in finalizing deals or even rightsizing deals in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment. This makes us slightly cautious about this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company\u2019s prospects in the near term.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nMoreover, CrowdStrike\u2019s valuation looks stretched at the current level, as reflected by the Value Score of F. We note that CrowdStrike currently has a one-year forward 12-month P/E ratio of 90.37. This level compares unfavorably with the industry average of 33.81. Hence, it would be prudent for investors to stay away from investing in the stock right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Many investors flock to growth stocks for consistent returns and high overall yield increases when the companies perform well. While some growth stocks suffer from high volatility, they can typically bounce back during harsh economic conditions. By holding them over time, investors also enjoy the return when these companies reach new heights.\n\nFor example, each of the following companies have established a strong foothold in their respective markets. Further, they currently demonstrate excellent success, and projections indicate continued long-term prosperity.\n\nLet\u2019s learn about the impressive demand, smart business models and diverse offerings propelling these stocks upward.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith digitalization at an all-time high, the demand for cybersecurity amongst businesses and consumers subsequently increases. Texas-based Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) holds a perfect position within the cybersecurity market to profit from this uptick. In fact, it has been riding a surging trend for over a year.\n\nWhat makes Crowdstrike such an excellent growth stock is its solid earnings and the years of experience over newer cybersecurity players. Crowdstrike has been in the game since 2011 and has one of the most effective cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI)-integrated platforms available, its Falcon platform.\n\nAlso, Falcon\u2019s years of data-gathering history vastly improves the functions of its AI capabilities. However, more than speculation, the effectiveness of Crowdstrike\u2019s platform is demonstrated in the numbers. Crowdstrike smashed earnings estimates and brought in revenue just short of $1 billion at $921.04 million in Q1.\n\nMoreover, customer loyalty and spending per customer continue to grow, meaning that every subscriber in their growing base spends incrementally more. The company has grown exponentially since its start and only shows a steeper upward curve.\n\nFor growth investors, a hot, in-demand stock like Crowdstrike is a no-brainer and an excellent addition to any portfolio.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify (SHOP) on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) is leading the charge for businesses transitioning their stores to digital or those looking to enhance their e-commerce sites. Online shopping has never been more popular, meaning businesses everywhere need a platform like Shopify to keep up with the times.\n\nNot only does Shopify have steady, solid subscription revenue, but it also has several other streams, from payment processing to shipping labels and its app store. Shopify has seen tremendous growth in recent years and has impressive earnings that display just how profitable the business can be.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q1, Shopify beat revenue estimates, reaching $1.9 billion in revenue and demonstrating a 23% increase year over year. Of this revenue, $1.4 billion comprised revenue from Merchant solutions and the remainder from subscriptions. It is a comfortable spread, considering most of Spotify\u2019s services are geared towards e-commerce merchants.\n\nThe good news for investors is that the stock is valued better than ever, slightly below its peak price. Spotify will only continue to grow as it implements AI solutions and services targeting larger-scale businesses in its lineup, and investors do not want to let this chance pass them by.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobally renowned streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has seen its fair share of ups and downs over the years. However, it has never been unable to bounce back from short-term losses and continues to prove itself as a top growth stock year after year.\n\nFurthermore, Netflix\u2019s most recent news should excite growth investors looking for a long-term buy \u2013 its new business model. Now that the company is generating healthy cash flow and revenue, it has announced a strategy focusing less on gaining subscribers and more on earning profit. The company will cease reporting quarterly subscriber counts but shift toward revealing engagement numbers, or actual time viewers spend using the service.\n\nIn Q1, Netflix reported a 15% growth in revenue year-over-year and $5.28 in earnings per share, up from $2.88 last year. The company expects very similar growth for Q2 and the remainder of 2024.\n\nAt $685 per share, Netflix isn\u2019t a cheap stock. But it\u2019s on track to maintain excellent growth at an incredible pace. Therefore, a big investment now will likely mean a big return in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Q1 Earnings Highlights: CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) Vs The Rest Of The Cybersecurity Stocks\n\nAs the Q1 earnings season wraps, let's dig into this quarter's best and worst performers in the cybersecurity industry, including CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) and its peers.\n\nCybersecurity continues to be one of the fastest-growing segments within software for good reason. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing rising cybersecurity risks. Businesses are accelerating adoption of cloud-based software, moving data and applications into the cloud to save costs while improving performance. This migration has opened them to a multitude of new threats, like employees accessing data via their smartphone while on an open network, or logging into a web-based interface from a laptop in a new location.\n\nThe 9 cybersecurity stocks we track reported a slower Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.4%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.5% below consensus. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and while some of the cybersecurity stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 3.4% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD)\n\nFounded by George Kurtz, the former CTO of the antivirus company McAfee, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) provides cybersecurity software that protects companies from breaches and helps them detect and respond to cyber attacks.\n\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $921 million, up 33% year on year, topping analysts' expectations by 1.8%. It was a strong\u00a0quarter for the company:\u00a0CrowdStrike narrowly topped analysts' revenue and ARR (annual recurring revenue) expectations, showing customers continue investing in its products. Looking ahead, it raised its full-year revenue and EPS guidance, which beat Wall Street's projections.\n\n\u201cCrowdStrike started the fiscal year from a position of momentum and exceptional strength, with net new ARR of $212 million growing 22% year-over-year and ending ARR growing 33% year-over-year to reach $3.65 billion,\u201d said George Kurtz, CrowdStrike's president, chief executive officer and co-founder.

It was a very strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' billings estimates and a solid beat of analysts' ARR (annual recurring revenue) estimates.

It was a weak quarter for the company, with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and decelerating customer growth.\n\nRapid7 had the weakest full-year guidance update in the group. The company lost 64 customers and ended up with a total of 11,462. The stock is down 20.7% since the results and currently trades at $36.33.\n\nRead our full analysis of Rapid7's results here.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nFounded in 2005 by cybersecurity engineer Nir Zuk, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) makes hardware and software cybersecurity products that protect companies from cyberattacks, breaches, and malware threats.\n\nPalo Alto Networks reported revenues of $1.98 billion, up 15.3% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was an ok quarter for the company:\u00a0Revenue beat by a small amount and operating profit as well as EPS beat by more convincing amounts.

        "title": "The Hype Horror Show 3 Overvalued Stocks That Will Haunt Your Portfolio",
        "content": "In the current investment climate, the stock market has witnessed some stocks reaching sky-high valuations driven more by speculative hype than substantive economic performance. This trend creates a precarious situation for investors, whose portfolios may suffer if these stocks adjust to more rational levels, reflecting their true business value.\n\nThis scenario is akin to a horror show for the unwary investor, where today\u2019s star stocks can quickly turn into tomorrow\u2019s dreadful losses, haunting portfolios with their sharp declines. There are sectors in the market that have shown signs of overheating, and the stocks within them could be on the verge of a significant correction. By identifying these potential pitfalls, investors can better navigate the eerie heights of market hype and protect their investments from becoming ghostly remnants of a once-booming stock craze.\n\nHence, here are three overvalued stocks that investors should avoid at all costs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMobileye (MBLY) An image of the interior view of a self-driving car, sensing objects in the road\n\nSource: Pavel Vinnik/Shutterstock\n\nMobileye (NASDAQ:MBLY) specializes in creating software, cameras, and sensors that power systems designed to make driving safer.\n\nCurrently, Mobileye\u2019s stock trades at about 77x forward non-GAAP operating profits, a stark premium in a market where price-to-earnings ratios in the tech sector are considerably lower on average. This pricing suggests high expectations for future earnings and growth \u2013 expectations that Mobileye may struggle to meet given the current economic landscape and internal company forecasts.\n\nMobileye itself has tempered expectations for growth in the near term, projecting no significant revenue increases for the year. This stagnant outlook is concerning because it diverges from the rapid growth trajectory that has characterized Mobileye\u2019s performance in the past. A static revenue forecast can be a deterrent for new investors and a sell signal for current holders as it suggests the company may be reaching a plateau.\n\nA critical issue facing Mobileye this year is its inventory management. The company has admitted to an excess inventory of EyeQ chips following a period of overproduction. This surplus could lead to a drag on revenue as the company struggles to align its inventory levels with actual market demand.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) 3D rendering of human on technology background\n\nSource: whiteMocca / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a leader in data analytics and artificial intelligence. Despite its cutting-edge technology and a solid growth trajectory, the company\u2019s valuation raises significant concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir trades at a sky-high forward price-to-earnings ratio of approximately 72x for the year 2024. Palantir\u2019s high valuation metrics are largely fueled by the hype surrounding artificial intelligence.\n\nHowever, it is essential to discern between the excitement of technological potential and the financial fundamentals that underpin a sound investment. Despite a promising sales growth forecast, Palantir\u2019s stock could be significantly overpriced if its AI sector hype diminishes or if the market experiences a rapid correction.\n\nPalantir\u2019s valuation presents a stark contrast when compared to historical metrics and peer averages. Currently, the company\u2019s enterprise value to forward EBITDA ratio stands at an extraordinary 53x, significantly higher than the median of 15x seen among its peers. This elevated metric places Palantir at the high end of the market spectrum, challenging the justification of its current market price based on traditional valuation methods.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leader in cloud-delivered endpoint and cloud workload protection. Despite its commendable performance and robust growth metrics, its valuation presents a complex picture. Currently trading at a forward P/E of nearly 96x, CrowdStrike\u2019s valuation significantly outpaces its peers, raising questions about sustainability and future growth potential.\n\nCrowdStrike reported impressive results in its latest fiscal quarter, with revenue growth of 33% year-over-year (YoY). However, despite these gains, the stock trades at about 22x forward sales, highlighting a premium market position that exceeds many of its competitors in the cybersecurity space.\n\nWhile CrowdStrike continues to benefit from increased demand for cybersecurity solutions, the competitive landscape is intensifying. Competitors like Palo Alto Networks and Zscaler are also enhancing their offerings, with strategies that include aggressive pricing and expanded service platforms that could pressure CrowdStrike\u2019s market share and profitability. \u00a0The high valuation not only reflects the high expectations for future growth but also imposes a high entry barrier for new investors, making the stock potentially volatile to shifts in market sentiment or financial performance discrepancies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohammed Saqib did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "CrowdStrike detects advanced adversary attack in real-world, closed-book simulation in just four minutes, six to 11 times faster than competitive vendors; scores highest in detection coverage at 98%\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, June 18, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) set a new speed benchmark for cybersecurity threat detection, identifying and alerting on a sophisticated eCrime adversary attack in just four minutes during the closed-book MITRE Engenuity's ATT&CK\u00ae Evaluations: Managed Services-Round 2. CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Complete MDR operates at the speed of the adversary, detecting the security incident six to 11 times faster than competitive vendors, while scoring the highest in detection coverage at 98 percent.\n\nMITRE\u2019s closed book evaluation emulated a real-world eCrime attack without giving the vendors prior knowledge of the threat scenario \u2013 creating the most accurate assessment of a vendor\u2019s capabilities. In this scenario, prevention capabilities of the Falcon agent were not permitted and the Falcon platform was operating in detect-only mode, meaning no automated actions could be taken to kill processes. In this rigorous setting, CrowdStrike reported 42 out of the 43 (98%) adversary techniques. MITRE recorded CrowdStrike\u2019s mean-time-to-detect (MTTD) \u2013 the average time between when a specific attack activity was performed and an email alert regarding that activity was received \u2013 at a record-breaking four minutes, setting a new benchmark for speed in threat detection.\n\n\"Stopping breaches requires security teams to operate at the speed of the adversary. The Falcon platform's unique cloud-born, AI-native architecture with one intelligent sensor delivers the best analyst experience and the fastest, most effective cybersecurity outcomes in the industry,\" said Michael Sentonas, President of CrowdStrike. \"Multiple platforms and stitched-together solutions are hard to use, create operational complexity, and slow security teams down when speed matters most. This is evident in testing scenarios and even more so in real-world environments. The powerful combination of CrowdStrike\u2019s elite team of experts, the Falcon platform, and our knowledge of the adversary is unmatched in delivering the speed and efficacy needed to stop breaches.\"\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nTo learn more about how CrowdStrike achieved 98% coverage scores and set the benchmark in threat detection time, read our blog.

        "content": "While artificial intelligence has captured headlines since ChatGPT, the industry is still growing. The AI market is projected to maintain a compounded annual growth rate of 36.6% until 2030, suggesting that many of the industry\u2019s top corporations will continue to win.\n\nInvestors have different ideas about what makes a stock successful, but they monitor a few things. Corporations should exhibit rising revenue and profit margins. Advantages over competitors are also important, as a moat makes it easier for a firm to exceed investors\u2019 expectations. These are the AI stocks to buy now that look poised to outperform the stock market.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a quick and easy choice in the artificial intelligence industry. Even though the corporation has been mentioned many times and has become a household name, its financial growth is still spectacular.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRevenue increased by 262% year-over-year to reach $26 billion in Q1 FY25. Net income also soared by 628% year-over-year, reaching $14.9 billion. Nvidia has maintained net profit margins above 50% as big tech companies rush to buy the company\u2019s AI chips. This trend doesn\u2019t show any immediate signs of slowing down, which indicates more gains for long-term investors.\n\nNVDA stock has almost tripled year-to-date and is up by more than 3,300% over the past five years. Nvidia recently concluded a 10-for-1 stock split that suddenly puts it in a position to get added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Nvidia has the financials to back its success, and Wall Street is also convinced. The stock is currently rated as a Strong Buy among 40 analysts.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions for businesses. Cybersecurity is getting more important with each passing month as companies continue to rely on the internet for data storage and hackers get smarter.\n\nSome cyber hackers use artificial intelligence to hack more companies and conduct deeper attacks on isolated targets. Crowdstrike has also been upping its game with artificial intelligence defense systems. The Falcon Platform makes it easy for cybersecurity professionals to detect and address threats before companies get hacked.\n\nWhile most cybersecurity firms are experiencing headwinds, Crowdstrike continues to charge forward. Q1 FY25 revenue increased by 33% year-over-year to reach $921.0 million. Net income was $42.8 million compared to a $0.5 million profit in the same quarter last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdstrike generates most of its business from subscriptions, which means plenty of annual recurring revenue (ARR). The company\u2019s ARR stood at $3.65 billion at the end of the first quarter. That\u2019s up by 33% year-over-year.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been using artificial intelligence for numerous years to offer relevant search results for its users. Many business owners try to rank on top of these search engines and run advertisements to skip organic SEO. The strong demand for Google and YouTube ad placements has created a multi-billion dollar that keeps giving.\n\nThe tech giant reported 15% year-over-year revenue growth and 57% year-over-year net income growth in the first quarter. Cost-cutting measures continue to strengthen the bottom line while Alphabet diversifies beyond advertising. While ad platforms still make up most of the company\u2019s revenue, Google Cloud now makes up more than 10% of the firm\u2019s total revenue. Google Cloud is projected to get a boost from artificial intelligence that should translate into healthy profit margins.\n\nInvestors may be underestimating how quickly Alphabet can raise its net profit margins. The company seems to follow a similar playbook to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which focuses on efficiency. Alphabet only has a 28 P/E ratio and is up by 28% year-to-date. Further profit margin expansion should lead to considerable upside for the stock.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NVDA, CRWD and GOOG.

With companies set to join the index on June 24th, investors might consider the best stocks to buy among these titans.\n\nInclusion in this prestigious index is not just a mark of recognition, but a catalyst for increased investors attention and trading volume. This surge in attention is typically attributed to institutional investors, mutual funds and ETFs that will be forced to add them to their portfolios. Among the standout additions are Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), KKR (NYSE:KKR) and GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY).\u00a0For investors seeking outsized returns, these newly included companies represent promising opportunities across dynamic sectors.\n\nNow, let\u2019s unpack the top three stocks set to surge on their S&P 500 inclusion in June 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike, a leading cybersecurity company, has solidified its position as a critical player protecting businesses from digital threats. The 2024 fiscal year was pivotal after it reported its first full year of GAAP profitability as a public company.\n\nCrowdstrike\u2019s Falcon platform, leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning, provides a holistic security solution for its customers. Its cloud-native, full-stack architecture covers data, security and IT all in one platform. This technological edge has not only attracted a broad customer base but has boosted its appeal in the industry. In Q1 FY25, revenue increased 33% year-over-year (YOY) to $921 million. Net earnings swelled an astonishing 8,621% YOY to $42.8 million. It also generated $322.5 million in free cash flow from operations. The company started off the year with positive momentum, despite ongoing headwinds in the cybersecurity sector. Furthermore, Crowdstrike recently announced a collaboration with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to deliver Nvidia\u2019s AI computing services through its XDR platform. This makes CRWD stock one of the best stocks to buy on its S&P 500 inclusion in June.\n\nKKR (KKR) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks. stocks to buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nKKR, a global investment firm, is another significant addition to the S&P 500. The firm\u2019s extensive experience and strategic approach to investing have made it a formidable player in the financial sector.\n\nKKR\u2019s recent performance has been extremely impressive. The company reported robust revenue growth in the 2023 fiscal year, and improving financial conditions in the economy support growth to continue. As of Q1 FY24, KKR\u2019s assets under management (AUM) stood at a staggering $578 billion, reflecting a YOY increase of 13%. Revenue during the quarter skyrocketed 229% YOY to $10.62 billion, with EPS more than doubling to 74 cents per share. This growth has been driven by strategic acquisitions, successful investment exits and a strong pipeline of new opportunities. The inclusion of KKR in the S&P 500 is likely to result in substantial inflows from index funds and institutional investors. Moreover, KKR\u2019s track record of delivering strong returns makes it a prime candidate for investors seeking lucrative stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoDaddy (GDDY) GoDaddy website\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoDaddy is one of the world\u2019s top providers of domain registration and web hosting services. The company\u2019s suite of services include website building, hosting, security and email marketing solutions.\n\nGoDaddy has become synonymous with empowering small businesses and entrepreneurs to establish their online presence. In the 2023 fiscal year, the company saw a significant boost in profitability driven by management\u2019s execution of strategic priorities. It remains committed to being a one-stop shop for entrepreneurs and small business owners to achieve their long term goals. GoDaddy\u2019s diverse platform offerings and investments in artificial intelligence have resulted in increased profitability, strong margin expansion and free cash flow. The inclusion of GoDaddy in the S&P 500 will be a significant milestone for the company. Additionally, it will enhance its visibility and attract investment from a wider audience. For those scouting for promising stocks to buy, GoDaddy is certainly a good place to start.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Meet the Newest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock in the S&amp;P 500. It's Up 266% Since Last Year, and Wall Street Says It's Still a Buy Today",
        "content": "The S&P 500 is one of the most important indexes in the financial markets.\n\nWhile it consists of just the stocks of 500 companies, it represents about 80% of all U.S. equities by market capitalization. To become a member, a company must obtain a market cap above $18 billion, produce a profit in the most recent quarter, and produce a profit in the most recent 12-month period. The stock must also have sufficient liquidity.\n\nEvery quarter, a committee selects a few new stocks to join the S&P 500 while deleting other stocks to make room. The goal is to include companies most representative of the large-cap space. This quarter, the committee added cybersecurity leader CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) to the index.\n\nCrowdStrike will join the index on June 24 alongside GoDaddy and KKR. Meanwhile, Robert Half, Comerica, and Illumina will be removed from the index to make room.\n\nCrowdStrike is the most recent AI stock to join the all-important S&P 500, which is dominated by AI innovators. Even after climbing 266% since the start of 2023, Wall Street thinks there's still room for the stock to run. Here's what investors need to know. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBuilding a competitive advantage with data and AI\n\nOver half of the Fortune 1000 use CrowdStrike's platform to secure their data. CrowdStrike's specialty is endpoint security, which focuses on protecting company devices like computers and smartphones.\n\nThis is a naturally growing market, as businesses use more data, and more of that data is transmitted over the internet and stored in the cloud. Global spending on endpoint security is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13% through 2029. Management sees its total addressable market more than doubling between 2024 and 2028. And CrowdStrike is positioned to take a larger piece of the expanding pie.\n\nThere are two reasons for that, both related to its existing position as the current market leader.\n\nFirst of all, there are significant switching costs when it comes to changing cybersecurity software. Managers don't want to risk cybersecurity breaches just to save a few bucks each month on software expenses. That makes CrowdStrike's services very sticky, as exemplified by its 98% gross-retention rate.\n\nAdding to that, CrowdStrike is successfully implementing a land-and-expand strategy. It's seeing a growing number of customers take five or more of its services. Its cloud, identity, and SIEM (security information and event management) products all grew revenue 90% or more last year. As a result, net-revenue retention is well over 100%, and its average recurring revenue grew 33% last quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe second factor driving CrowdStrike's growth is its investments in artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is fueled by data, including feedback. CrowdStrike's platform receives more than a trillion signals every day. As such, it can train its AI to recognize and respond to threats faster than the competition. That gives CrowdStrike something of a network advantage, which results in a virtuous cycle. The more companies using CrowdStrike's solutions the better those solutions perform.\n\nAnalysts think CrowdStrike is still a buy\n\nSeveral Wall Street analysts think CrowdStrike still has room to climb. Forty-seven out of 50 analysts rate the stock a buy or strong buy. Wells Fargo's Andrew Nowinski has the highest price target on the Street and sees shares climbing to $435 thanks to its partnership with Amazon. Amazon agreed to replace a variety of cloud-security products with CrowdStrike's in May.\n\nBut after strong price appreciation in recent weeks, investors may want to reconsider the stock at the current price. At its current share price, there's only about 12% upside to Nowinski's price target. And the average on the Street is much lower.\n\nAnd there's good reason. CrowdStrike currently trades at an enterprise-value-to-sales ratio of more than 27 times. While management expects revenue to keep climbing at a rate above 30% for the next year, that's still quite expensive for the stock. That multiple is up from about 11 times at the start of 2023, although close to its five-year median. The fair value of the stock may lie somewhere in the middle of those multiples.\n\nCrowdStrike is a market leader with clear competitive advantages, and it's exhibiting strong revenue growth. There's a case to be made for the stock at this price, but there may be better alternatives in AI and cybersecurity in today's market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Roaring Kitty brought meme stocks back to life. His first post in three years in mid-May caused GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares to triple in value almost overnight. It also dragged other left-for-dead meme stocks along for the ride.\n\nYet, the reaction to the meme lord (his real name is Keith Gill) by Wall Street was telling. The Wall Street Journal reported that discount broker E-Trade, owned by Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), was mulling whether to ban him from the platform. The investment firm\u2019s financial crimes division was examining whether his options trades before his social media post were legal. The trades also came under scrutiny from the Securities & Exchange Commission and state securities agencies.\n\nWhile we can debate whether the video game retailer is a good investment \u2014 I tend to disagree with Gill \u2014 canceling him and prohibiting him from trading seems extreme.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t be up for debate is the meme stocks to sell below. These companies had no business jumping as they did. Gill wasn\u2019t recommending their shares, only GameStop. Traders were simply trying to revive the meme stock-buying frenzy of 2021.\n\nHere is why you should avoid these meme stocks to sell.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC Entertainment sell off continues as stock sees tenth straight losing day, as the markets continued to see volatility following Federal Reserve Chairman's speech.\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nMovie theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) became every bit as much of a poster child for the meme stock trade as GameStop. Diehard loyalists deemed themselves \u201capes\u201d who would HODL (hold on for dear life) to AMC stock no matter what. Unfortunately, that hasn\u2019t amounted to much. Shares have lost 99% of their value from their high point three years ago.\n\nHowever, the Roaring Kitty social media post brought the stock back to life, and a better-than-expected first-quarter earnings report helped it hold onto its value. The movie theater stock has more than doubled from its April lows.\n\nYet better-than-expected does not necessarily mean good or sustainable. AMC Entertainment is still hurting because the movie industry remains in decline. Theater attendance is down as Hollywood forgot how to make blockbuster movies. This summer\u2019s lineup started with a dud, and there are only one or two films that have hopes of hitting it big.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t bode well for AMC Entertainment going forward, making it the first meme stock to sell now.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) TRUTH SOCIAL application and logo displayed on smartphone. a social media application created by former US president Donald Trump after being blocked from Facebook. DJT stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) remain flat from where they were when the social media company of former President Donald Trump began trading on the Nasdaq exchange. Over the past month, though, the stock is down 30%. Expect it to continue being volatile.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the presidential campaign heats up heading into November\u2019s elections, investors are likely in for a roller coaster ride as the former president commands even more attention on the national stage. His Truth Social platform will be a key part of how Trump amplifies his message, which could determine whether it remains a viable business.\n\nSo far, it doesn\u2019t look good. Although Trump Media doesn\u2019t publish daily active user numbers, arguing they are not useful for a new platform, sites that track visits indicate usage is falling. While Trump has not really posted much on X (formerly Twitter), CEO Elon Musk will be hosting a town hall-style meeting with him on the platform. That draws attention away from Truth Social.\n\nUltimately, there is a very limited audience for the platform. Because of the president\u2019s polarizing personality, many won\u2019t use the site. It will primarily be for those committed to following Trump. While that\u2019s not necessarily bad, it also doesn\u2019t offer much hope for growth.\n\nAt $37 per share, there is a lot of air under Trump Media & Technology Group stock through which it can fall.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) An image of the logo for BlackBerry Ltd (BB).\n\nSource: BlackBerry\n\nOnce known for its revolutionary mobile handsets, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) is a very different company today. It is now a security and software business, which, though offering critical services, is a shell of its former self. It is experiencing growth but not on a scale necessary to take on its larger, better-financed rivals. There is a niche for BlackBerry stock to exist but not much to make an investment out of.\n\nBlackBerry\u2019s main business is cybersecurity. It offers secure communications platforms, endpoint control systems and analytics tools and services. The company is very much in the same vein as CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) and Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), though on a dramatically smaller scale. It also tends to perform best in regulated markets, such as government, healthcare and financials, where security is paramount. But that could limit growth as well as expansion into other enterprise-class industries.\n\nBlackBerry also targets the auto industry with semiconductor, safety systems and cabin feature technologies. Despite its QNX operating system offering good growth prospects with original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and Tier 1 suppliers, it is the smaller of BlackBerry\u2019s two businesses.\n\nIn short, there\u2019s not a lot to expect from BlackBerry. It is a relatively small fish in a small pond. The stock is down 54% over the past year, and there do not appear to be any catalysts to reverse its course.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): A Good SaaS Company to Invest In?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best SaaS Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other SaaS stocks.\n\nSaaS, also known as software as a service, is one of the biggest and most important industries in today's high technology era. SaaS evolved along with personal computing, and initially, it allowed businesses to make use of software to manage their supply chains, manufacturing, and other business operations.\n\nSoftware as a service means that a SaaS customer simply needs access to a computer and the internet to use the service. Since the post broadband internet revolution, internet speed and bandwidth have increased to such an extent that consumers can easily stream high definition videos from the comfort of their homes. Simultaneously, businesses are also able to use third party software for functions such as payroll and human resource management. Relying on SaaS for entertainment or business management allows users to access a portfolio of specialized and customized services to suit their requirements without having to invest heavily in equipment or resources.\n\nAdditionally, the boom of artificial intelligence products means that SaaS is right at the front of the technological revolution. AI is, after all, software, and most AI users are unlikely to invest in expensive GPUs or hardware to run their models. Therefore, it's only natural that AI becomes an extension of SaaS, with models such as ChatGPT providing users globally with a novel software tool that they can use as they please.\n\nThe popularity of Software as a Service (SaaS) stocks has surged in recent years, driven by the widespread adoption of cloud-based solutions across industries. Products like Zoom have become essential tools for businesses, enhancing productivity, scalability, and cost-efficiency. This trend reflects the broader digital transformation that has been accelerated by the global shift to remote work and online services.\n\nMarc Andreessen's influential essay, \"Why Software Is Eating the World,\" published in 2011, foresaw this shift. Andreessen argued that software companies would revolutionize traditional industries by leveraging the internet's power to deliver innovative and scalable solutions. He predicted that every company would eventually become a software company, driven by the need to adapt to the digital age. Andreessen's vision has proven prescient as we witness the dominance of SaaS companies in the stock market. These firms offer subscription-based models that provide continuous revenue streams and foster long-term customer relationships. This business model has attracted investors due to its predictability and growth potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ability of SaaS firms and stocks to benefit from the Internet also means that the sector is quite lucrative. Market research shows that the global SaaS market was worth $276 billion in 2022. From then until 2032, the sector is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.9% to be worth $1 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Individual SaaS stocks, like their broader technology peers, have also seen investors react to AI announcements. Those who have convinced Wall Street of their ability to blend AI into their product portfolios have flourished while others have floundered.\n\nFinally, and before we head to our list of the best SaaS stocks that hedge funds are buying, it's also important to understand how these stocks differ from others. Since SaaS is a high growth industry which prioritizes growth over profitability. Many SaaS businesses follow a \"land and expand\" strategy. This means acquiring a large customer base initially, even if it means sacrificing short-term profits. The idea is that once they have a sizable customer base, they can focus on increasing revenue from existing customers through upselling and cross-selling additional services. In certain competitive SaaS niches, achieving a dominant market share early on can also be crucial. By prioritizing rapid growth and user acquisition, SaaS companies can establish themselves as the leading player in their niche. This can create network effects, where the value of the platform increases as more users join, making it even more attractive to new customers. As a result, investors typically analyze SaaS firms through their revenue and enterprise value as opposed to their profitability. The enterprise value of a firm is an extension of its market value of equity as it adds the value of net debt that the firm has taken on. Net debt is total debt minus cash and equivalents, and for SaaS investors, one key metric is dividing the EV by the revenue. Generally, a higher EV/Revenue multiple suggests a more valuable company.\n\nThis multiple is also affected by interest rates. When interest rates rise, the discount rate used to value future cash flows also increases. This discount rate reflects the time value of money and the potential return investors could earn elsewhere. For high-growth stocks like SaaS companies, a large portion of their value is derived from the expectation of significant future earnings. A higher discount rate makes those future earnings less valuable in today's dollars, leading to a lower present value for the stock. When the interest rates were reduced to historically low levels during the pandemic, SaaS companies took off and traded at median EV/Revenue multiples of nearly 20 in 2021. Before the pandemic, the media EV/Revenue multiple for the publicly traded SaaS stocks was around 11.\n\nAfter the Fed increased short term interest rates to above 5% in 2022 and 2023, SaaS companies' EV/Revenue multiples contracted sharply. For the last 18 months, the median multiple is hovering around 7. Fed's interest rate policy shift is one reason for this decline; however, declining growth rates is another. SaaS companies used to grow their revenues by around 30% before the pandemic and this figure increased to 33% in 2021. However, we observed a sharp contraction in growth rates since then. Currently, the median revenue growth rate for publicly traded SaaS companies is around 17%.\n\nIt isn't just a coincidence that the growth rates of SaaS companies went down as the Fed increased interest rates. Higher interest rates make cost of capital expensive, and this leads to lower demand for capital spending. Higher interest rates also force unprofitable companies into cost cutting because they can't easily raise capital anymore. As a result, most SaaS companies, especially the ones that burn cash at high rates, switch from prioritizing growth to prioritizing profitability.\n\nWe believe we are at the end of the \"SaaS winter\" as the market expects the Fed to start cutting interest rates later in 2024. This means the dynamics that led to lower valuation multiples and lower growth rates for publicly traded SaaS stocks will reverse and we will see higher stock prices for SaaS stocks. The average return of hedge funds' favorite 10 SaaS stocks is -10% in 2024 and underperformed the market by nearly 25 percentage points so far this year. We don't know when the perfect time to buy these SaaS stocks is, but we believe this is a good time to establish entry positions in these stocks as these stocks will start to recover their losses after the Fed starts to cut interest rates.\n\nSo, with these details in mind, let's take a look at the best SaaS stocks to buy now according to hedge funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best SaaS stocks, we first made a list of the top 30 SaaS stocks in the US by their market capitalization. They were then ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024, and the top SaaS stocks were selected. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:CRWD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 76\n\nYTD Return: 51%\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity SaaS company that allows businesses to manage and monitor their platforms for threats. June 2024 has been an important month for the SaaS stock since it is slated to be included in the illustrious S&P 500 index. The shares jumped by 9.6% when the news hit the wires, and it came after a strong earnings report. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s latest earnings saw it report $921 million in revenue and $0.93 in adjusted earnings per share. Not only did the revenue mark a 33% annual growth, but it also saw CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) beat revenue and EPS estimates of $905 million and $0.89, respectively. Following the report, FBN Securities raised the share price target to $400 from $390 and maintained an Outperform rating on the stock.\n\nThe average of 45 one year analyst share price targets for CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CRWD)'s three year annualized revenue growth rate is a strong 51.75%. Carillon Tower Advisors mentioned the firm in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, a security software provider, reported strong earnings results, driven by strength in endpoint security, cloud security, and identity protection. Revenue growth and profitability metrics exceeded investor expectations for the quarter, and the forward guidance was ahead of expectations as well. The cyber threat environment remains elevated, and it is likely that the rise of artificial intelligence will make it easier for criminals and threat actors to design and launch sophisticated attacks, increasing the need for CrowdStrike.\n\nOverall CRWD ranks 7th on our list of the best SaaS stocks to buy.

        "content": "U.S. equities are reaching new highs after May\u2019s consumer price index (CPI) report indicated significant cooling in pricing pressures across the broad. The headline inflation figure came in flat, while the \u201ccore\u201d reading, which excludes price volatility from food and energy, increased only 0.2% month-over-month. The year-over-year increase in prices landed at 3.3%, which represented the first significant cooling we have seen since the second quarter of 2021. These trends could contribute to market conditions that outline which stocks to sell.\n\nNonetheless, the U.S. Federal Reserve is keeping to its cautious stance and revised the rate forecast outlined in December. Instead of three rate cuts in 2024, the central bank has projected a single 0.25% reduction in the Federal Funds rate. This bit of bad news has not quelled markets though. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has rallied 15.5% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, while the S&P500 has also enjoyed a 12.7% surge.\n\nHowever, all of this relatively good news does not mean there aren\u2019t any stocks to avoid. Investors will not want any of these three stocks to sell in their portfolio unless they desire a gloomy June.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSentinelOne (NYSE:S), a once compelling way to play the cybersecurity space, has seen its share plummet in 2024. In particular, the cybersecurity software firm\u2019s share price has fallen more than 34% on a YTD basis. This is in stark contrast to SentinelOne\u2019s meteoric rally in 2023, wherein shares rose 88.1%. Despite having a platform that checks all the boxes for employing novel technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), SentinelOne is struggling to spur top-line growth in a troubled global economic environment and highly competitive market.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, SentinelOne released its fourth-quarter earnings report for the company\u2019s fiscal year 2024, which ended January 31, and despite a sizable earnings beat, investors were unimpressed with full-year guidance for the following fiscal year. Moreover, first-quarter results for fiscal year 2025 also beat Wall Street estimates but did not come with any upward revisions to guidance, again leaving investors underwhelmed.\n\nCompressing growth rates spell bad news for SentinelOne\u2019s share price going forward, and in the meantime, competitor CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) continues to see strong revenue and earnings figures while also enjoying a significant rally in its share price.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) SoundHound Inc.'s (SOUN) Headquarters exterior. The company develops voice-recognition, natural language understanding, sound-recognition and search technologies.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) was supposed to be an unstoppable AI stock, but then a revealing short seller report from Capybara Research was released. The report asserted the start-up\u2019s artificial intelligence solutions, which allow businesses to develop AI-driven conversational experiences for their customers, were predicated on speech-recognition technology already widely available. Not to mention, tech titans, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have rolled out similar voice-recognition products and features.\n\nEven with Nvidia being a notable investor in SoundHound AI, the company\u2019s stock has plummeted from its stratospheric highs since then. In mid-March, SOUN had skyrocketed as much as 320.3% since the start of trading in 2024, but now the company\u2019s share price is up 119.3%. Of course, this performance is nothing to snooze at, but a lack of interest or growth catalysts for the AI firm could lead to further losses in the future, making it one of the stocks to sell.\n\nIonQ (IONQ) IONQ logo\n\nThe quantum computing space has enjoyed much attention lately. The rise of generative artificial intelligence technologies has left investors to wonder what technological revolution could be next. Quantum computing, when scaled up, could affect significant change across various fields, including climate science and finance. The space of public quantum computing companies is full of legacy technology firms that have invested in the technology for decades as well as a handful of notable start-ups.\n\nIonQ (NYSE:IONQ) is one of those pure-play quantum computing startups that rose to prominence with its innovative ion-trapping technology that the firm has leveraged to build its quantum computers. The quantum computing firm\u2019s Forte system takes advantage of 36 qubits and is IonQ\u2019s \u201chighest performing system to date.\u201d\n\nIonQ\u2019s first quarter results for fiscal year 2024 came in above Wall Street\u2019s estimates, but unfortunately, shares are still down a significant 35.8% for the year. The lack of commercial practicality for quantum computing at this moment as well as IonQ\u2019s sizable net losses will likely lead to more downward pressure on IonQ\u2019s shares.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "Investors load up on growth stocks hoping that they can outperform popular market indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. While it\u2019s possible for individual picks to exceed these funds, picking wrong can result in losses.\n\nSavvy investors have to navigate the potential of high returns with considerable downside. Truly, no growth stock can guarantee a high return. But you can increase your chances by seeking corporations with rising revenue and profit margins.\n\nWhile short-term momentum can result in sizable gains, a company\u2019s financial growth, balance sheet and catalysts determine its long-term returns. Investors who set lengthy time horizons can see more of those catalysts play out. You don\u2019t have to pursue speculative stocks to beat the market. Some corporations are already well-known and have been around for decades. Places you shop at regularly and companies you\u2019ve heard of several times can be the leaders in your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTherefore, these are some of the top growth stocks to consider.\n\nComfort Systems USA (FIX) Back View of the Head of the Project Holds Laptop and Discussing Product Details with Chief Engineer while They Walk Through Modern Factory., FR rents out these spaces in the U.S.\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nComfort Systems USA (NYSE:FIX) offers air conditioning installation, maintenance, repair and replacement services for commercial and industrial clients. The company has a very impressive dividend history, going from a quarterly payout of $0.20 per share to $0.30 per share in one year. The HVAC company usually raises its dividend at least twice per year.\n\nThe firm recently reported impressive results in the first quarter of 2024. Revenue increased by 31% year-over-year (YOY) to reach $1.54 billion. Meanwhile, net income grew by 68% YOY to reach $96.3 million. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Lane mentioned that the company\u2019s new acquisitions are off to great starts. Comfort Systems USA currently has a $5.91 billion backlog, which is a 33% YOY improvement from a $4.44 billion backlog in the same quarter last year.\n\nAlso, FIX has been outperforming the stock market. Shares are up by 50% year-to-date (YTD) and have gained 517% over the past five years. It trades at a 30 P/E ratio and offers a 0.39% yield. The air conditioning firm has an $11 billion market cap.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nWell-loved Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) continues to attract customers despite periodically raising its prices. The fast food restaurant chain offers healthier food choices than competitors, which has helped Chipotle outperform the stock market. Shares are up by 43% YTD and have soared by 352% over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst quarter results suggest that the trend will continue. Revenue increased by 14.1% YOY to $2.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share came to $13.01 per share which is a 23.9% YOY boost. Also, Chipotle opened 47 new restaurants during the quarter and remains on pace to open 285-315 restaurants this year.\n\nThe stock has attracted more attention due to its upcoming 50-for-1 stock split. This split will make the price per share more affordable for people who prefer to own large quantities of entire shares versus a fractional share. The upcoming split will also increase options trading activity for the stock which will lead to more volatility.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

The hacking industry has become lucrative, and artificial intelligence (AI) is making it easier for bad actors to infiltrate companies at scale.\n\nCybersecurity solutions like Crowdstrike allow businesses to detect and eliminate threats before they get into your system. A single cyberattack can wipe out a small business, and corporations can end up losing millions of dollars between legal fees, lost customer loyalty and digital assets getting released into the public.\n\nCrowdstrike has delivered exceptional returns for its investors while serving numerous companies. Shares are up by 40% YTD and have gained 441% over the past five years. A strong Q1 of 2025 earnings report indicates that the growth should continue.

        "title": "Just Like Airbnb, Uber, and Super Micro Computer Before It, CrowdStrike Is Joining the S&amp;P 500. Here's What History Says Will Happen Next.",
        "content": "On June 7, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) will be entering its famous S&P 500 index on June 24. It's an announcement that's captured the attention of many investors.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $94 billion as of this writing, CrowdStrike will be one of the most valuable companies ever added to the S&P 500. In recent years, Airbnb and Uber Technologies have been other major additions with valuations of around $80 billion and $125 billion, respectively. While CrowdStrike goes toe-to-toe with these industry leaders, by far the largest addition was Tesla in 2020, which boasted a market cap of about $400 billion when news broke of its addition to the S&P 500.\n\nSo what can CrowdStrike investors expect now? Here are some takeaways we can glean by using history as a guide.\n\nThe S&P 500 inclusion effect\n\nThere's an investing theory called the S&P 500 inclusion effect. The theory states that between the announcement and the day it officially joins the index, stocks tend to outperform the market average. As an example, Super Micro Computer was added to the S&P 500 earlier this year, and it indeed outperformed between the announcement and its official inclusion.\n\nHowever, this doesn't always happen, and any gains aren't usually as big as they were for Super Micro Computer. For example, Deckers Outdoor was announced and added at the exact same time as Super Micro Computer. But it didn't enjoy the same rally as you can see below: SMCI Chart\n\nIn other words, stocks aren't guaranteed to get a major boost when they're in line to join the S&P 500 -- Super Micro Computer jumped whereas Deckers barely moved.\n\nCrowdStrike stock could decline in the next month or so based on a 2021 study from S&P Global that analyzed over 25 years of data. According to the study, between the announcement and official inclusion in the S&P 500, the median stock outperformance was about 3.5 percentage points. In other words, if the S&P 500 went up 1% during the interim period, the stock joining the index went up about 4.5%.\n\nAs of this writing, CrowdStrike stock is up 11.0% since its announcement, but the S&P 500 is up 1.4%. If the trends from the S&P Global study hold, CrowdStrike will pull back over the next couple of weeks.\n\nBeyond this, S&P Global's study found that from a stock's official inclusion in the index to 21 days after inclusion, the median stock underperformed the index by 1.7 points.\n\nIn other words, CrowdStrike stock could trail the S&P 500 from June 24 through the middle of July, based on these historical trends.\n\nStory continues\n\nDoes this mean investors should sell CrowdStrike stock?\n\nWhether you're a trader or a long-term investor, your alarm bells might be ringing right now after reading the above. But they should be ringing for entirely different reasons.\n\nAlarm bells are ringing for traders because they're seeing the potential for CrowdStrike to reverse its recent rally. However, alarm bells should be ringing for investors because they recognize the risks that come with taking action based on these short-term fluctuations. Selling based on the S&P Global study would be ill-advised.\n\nWill CrowdStrike stock go down over the next month or so? It's possible. But then again, underperformance over a short time period is always possible. After all, short-term price movements are impossible to predict. That's why most day traders lose money.\n\nBy contrast, long-term returns tend to be based on actual business results. And thinking about things this way, investors should be encouraged by the recent news. After all, joining the largest, most profitable U.S. companies in the S&P 500 doesn't just happen -- CrowdStrike is where it is after years of strong business performance.\n\nLooking ahead, there's reason to believe CrowdStrike can continue to outperform. Over the next four years or so, the company expects its market opportunity to more than double to $225 billion, providing it with a long growth runway.\n\nFor years now, CrowdStrike has demonstrated its ability to grow faster than its peers as it takes market share. The company continues to expand the offerings on its cloud-based platform, providing substantial upsell opportunities. Moreover, it's shown it can do all of this profitably.\n\nIn other words, CrowdStrike has achieved profitable growth in a growing industry. Considering nothing has changed about the company given this latest news, it's reasonable to expect these trends to continue. Yes, being added to the S&P 500 could cause some near-term ups and downs with its stock price. However, nothing has changed for long-term investors who rightly focus on the underlying business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

(To learn more about what Apple unveiled during its WWDC conference, read Friday\u2019s Market 360 here.)\n\nHowever, it was CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\u2019s (CRWD) 10% pop on Monday that caught my attention first. CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that offers real-time endpoint security, threat intelligence and cloud workload protection. It aims to protect cyberattacks on and off an enterprise\u2019s network.\n\nSo, in today\u2019s Market 360, I\u2019ll explain what was behind the jump in CRWD stock\u2026 and how growth in artificial intelligence could push it even higher. And then, I\u2019ll share where you can learn more about other stocks that are set to explode thanks to AI.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nCrowdStrike to Be Added to the S&P 500\n\nLast Friday, June 7, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that CrowdStrike will be added to the S&P 500 on June 24 as part of the index\u2019s quarterly rebalancing, replacing Comerica Inc. (CMA).\n\nOnce per quarter, S&P Global rebalances its indices, including the S&P 500. It looks for companies that now qualify that didn\u2019t before (like having too small of a market cap). It also looks for changes such as acquisitions or spin-offs that could affect a company\u2019s qualifications to stay or be added to the index.\n\nWhenever changes are made to the S&P 500, portfolio managers have to adjust mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that follow the index. Stocks that are added tend to pop, while stocks that are deleted tend to fall.\n\nThis is exactly what happened with CrowdStrike.\n\nAs of this writing, the stock is now up about 23% in June, but I don\u2019t expect its momentum to slow down anytime soon, thanks to AI\u2026\n\nCrowdStrike Enters a New Phase of Growth\n\nThe company\u2019s platform, The CrowdStrike Falcon, utilizes its proprietary CrowdStrike Threat Graph to identify security threats and prevent data breaches. CrowdStrike boasts that its platform combines AI and machine learning with behavioral analytics and 24/7 threat hunting, all in one solution to protect all workloads on the network \u2013 cloud-based, on-premise and virtual environments.\n\nThanks to its Falcon platform, CrowdStrike can attach new offerings to it (a strategy commonly known as \u201cland and expand\u201d). This, in turn, is allowing the company to enter a new phase of growth.\n\nCrowdStrike has been adding features such as cloud security, identity security, and security operations, enabling it to steal market share from smaller single-product rivals. For example, Okta, Inc. (OKTA), a smaller firm focused on identity security, has seen its share price fall by 61% as of this writing, since 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, there are two key drivers that allow this land-and-expand strategy to work.\n\nThe first is AI. Artificial intelligence relies on acquiring massive amounts of training data, which benefits large firms like CrowdStrike. These incumbents can \u201csee\u201d more threats thanks to their customer base, and so it creates a virtuous cycle. Larger companies create more powerful AI systems, which attract more new users, and so on. It\u2019s also important to note that one solution can get rolled out to every customer.\n\nThe second trend is corporate belt-tightening surrounding the costs of AI and cybersecurity. In the past, enterprises accepted multiple cybersecurity vendors since each software firm added another layer of potential protection. For example, a typical office worker might have signed on to their work computer with Okta verification and accessed their company\u2019s network with a ZScaler product, all while routing communications through a Fortinet firewall. In 2020, Cisco estimated that as many as 13% of large firms used more than 20 separate cybersecurity vendors.\n\nBut that\u2019s quickly changing thanks to one-stop shop firms like CrowdStrike.\n\nBy combining multiple products onto a single platform, these cybersecurity firms are able to both reduce costs while improving protection across the board. CrowdStrike now has a net retention rate of over 120%, an incredible figure given its size.\n\nNew AI Opportunities Are Brewing\n\nThe bottom line: CrowdStrike is a great company with plenty of potential upside. Due to its superior fundamentals, I even recommended it in Growth Investor earlier this year, and it\u2019s now sitting pretty with a 32% return on my Growth Investor Buy List. However, there\u2019s no denying that AI will likely play a large role in its future growth.\n\nBut it\u2019s not the only company that\u2019s set to benefit from artificial intelligence\u2026 There\u2019s a new set of AI stocks that could take off on or before November 5.\n\nI\u2019ll admit, my latest prediction may be a bit controversial. But I have an obligation to tell my readers about profit opportunities in the market, plain and simple.\n\nIn short, my prediction has to do with former President Donald Trump \u2013 and how, if elected, he could usher in a Second Wave of the AI Boom.\n\nAs the election draws near, you\u2019ll want to be prepared. Because a small subset of AI stocks are on the verge of massive gains.\n\nGo here to learn more about my controversial prediction now.\n\n(Already a Growth Investor subscriber?

        "content": "Finding the top stocks to buy for the next bull run greatly improves an investor\u2019s portfolio and increases profits. The research emphasizes the need to make wise investing decisions before favorable market circumstances emerge. Investors may profit from market surges and steer clear of the traps associated with reactive investing by having a solid understanding of which stocks will likely expand. It is important to have a well-thought-out investing plan since there is a chance for substantial rewards.\n\nScanning companies with solid growth indicators, resilient past performance and innovative histories is crucial. These traits indicate the possibility of consistent success and market leadership. Examining the fundamentals of the three exceptional companies provides insights into why they are the best investments for the upcoming bull market, providing a tactical edge in the volatile stock market. This proactive strategy increases the likelihood of significant returns when the market trend turns upward and is consistent with long-term financial objectives.\n\nVale (VALE) the Vale logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's webpage in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nVale (NYSE:VALE) leads mining operations,\u00a0mostly\u00a0for iron ore and copper. With a 15% rise in sales year-over-year (YoY) in Q1 2024, Vale produced the most iron ore for Q1 since 2019. This increase indicates improved operational dependability and efficiency, especially at the S11D complex, which amounts to an additional 8.2 million tons of iron ore sold. The expansion plans for Vale are expected to increase capacity by 50 million tons by 2026. Moreover, a critical milestone is the Vargem Grande project, which is 90% finished and set to begin in Q4 2024. The impending capacity expansions will strengthen Vale\u2019s ability to produce iron ore.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurther, with the help of a truckless system and more geological information, the S11D complex produced more than it had in any Q1 since 2020. Thanks to increased output at the Salobo 1 and 2 facilities and the ramp-up of the Salobo 3 project, Vale\u2019s copper production increased significantly by\u00a022% YoY in Q1. Sales of copper increased by 14K tons YoY, indicating Vale\u2019s effective entry into the copper market. To sum up, Vale\u2019s strategic projects are set to add substantial capacity, reinforcing its position among the top stocks to buy for the next bull run.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) specializes in data analytics and software solutions. Its top-line growth has mostly been driven by its U.S. commercial segment, which has shown solid revenue and client base growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the U.S. commercial revenue surpassed the overseas commercial revenue for the first time in Q1 2024, rising by\u00a040% YoY to $150 million\u00a0and growing 14% sequentially. The number of US business clients increased by 69% YoY and 19% sequentially to 262 customers. Both new and existing clients\u2019 use of the AI Platform (AIP) is a\u00a0major\u00a0factor in this increase. Thus, the company gained 41 net new clients in the US business sector in the first quarter alone.\n\nAdditionally, Palantir\u2019s strategy for interacting with customers and its accomplishment in shortening the sales cycle are important assets that underpin the company\u2019s potential for quick expansion. The company has maintained many programs, with over\u00a0915 businesses participating in boot camps.\u00a0This\u00a0has\u00a0greatly\u00a0helped to fulfill the incoming demand. Hence, these boot camps have proven to be successful in turning curiosity into large agreements very quickly.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity leader. With a record Q1 net new annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $212 million, the business posted a 22% YoY gain. This massive growth in new ARR reflects the market\u2019s confidence in CrowdStrike\u2019s products and suggests solid client acquisition and retention. With a 33% YoY rise, the company\u2019s closing ARR of $3.65 billion was achieved. Similarly, a solid subscriber base and recurring income stream are indicated in the high-end ARR.\n\nMoreover, CrowdStrike attained an unprecedented\u00a080% subscription gross margin. This high margin shows effective cost control and the potential to profit from subscription services. The business announced $322 million in record free cash flow, or 35% of revenue. This result demonstrates outstanding cash-generating capabilities and aligns with the free cash flow rule 68. Free cash flow is a vital indicator of the company\u2019s financial stability and capacity to finance expansion plans without significantly depending on outside funding.\n\nTo conclude, Crowdstrike is a top choice among stocks to buy for the next bull run due to its high subscription gross margins, substantial increases in ARR and free cash flow.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in PLTR.

        "title": "2 Remarkable Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "Well-chosen growth stocks can create fortunes for patient shareholders. Here are two companies with particularly impressive expansion potential. Consider buying their shares today, and you could position yourself to profit handsomely in the years ahead.\n\nGrowth stock to buy No. 1: Archer Aviation\n\nYour next ride to the airport might be on a flying taxi. Archer Aviation(NYSE: ACHR) wants to make this sci-fi-like vision a reality -- and it's farther along than you might imagine.\n\nArcher's Midnight electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicle features advanced tilt-propeller technology. That means it can lift off like a helicopter and fly like an airplane. It's called Midnight, and its all-electric design is quiet and creates no operating emissions, which makes it a more sustainable form of transportation than jet-fuel-powered aircraft.\n\nTraveling at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour, Midnight can replace 50-mile commutes by car that take more than an hour in traffic with air-taxi flights that take only 15-20 minutes. Archer Aviation's Midnight aircraft. Image source: Archer Aviation.\n\nThe time, convenience, and environmental benefits provided by eVTOL aircraft are expected to bring about a boom in high-speed urban travel. The urban air mobility market, in turn, will grow to a stunning $1 trillion by 2040, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nWith so much growth to come, transportation industry leaders are leaping at the chance to partner with Archer. Boeing, United Airlines, Stellantis, and other notable backers have invested a total of over $1 billion in the eVTOL pioneer.\n\nMoreover, Stellantis is helping Archer ramp up its manufacturing capabilities. At the same time, United Airlines is working with Archer to launch commercial air taxi routes in the U.S. United has also placed an order for up to $1.5 billion worth of the EV-maker's vehicles.\n\nWith these partnerships in place, Archer plans to launch electric air-taxi services by late 2025. The EV upstart's revenue could grow quickly in subsequent years as it scales its operations in the U.S. and international markets like the United Arab Emirates.\n\nYet despite these tantalizing growth prospects, Archer's stock is currently on sale. With its previously high-flying shares now off about 55% from their 52-week highs, Archer's market capitalization currently checks in squarely in small-cap territory at about $1 billion. Invest today, and you could enjoy multibagger returns if this flying-EV leader can jump-start an eventual trillion-dollar air-mobility industry in the coming years.\n\nGrowth stock to buy No. 2: CrowdStrike\n\nCybersecurity is another huge growth market. Grand View Research estimates that the market for digital defenses will grow by more than 12% annually to over $500 billion by 2023. CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) is a leader in this booming industry and well-situated to continue to reward its shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike's bread and butter is endpoint security. It's the best in the business at protecting devices like smartphones, laptops, and Internet of Things (IoT) systems. The cloud sentinel is thus a key beneficiary of several major trends, including the rise of remote workforces and the shift toward edge computing.\n\nThe ever-growing mountains of data that flow through CrowdStrike's Falcon platform provide it with a powerful competitive edge. Its machine-learning technology becomes more intelligent each day as it scans over 2 trillion cyber events from around the world. And when CrowdStrike's cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) identifies a new danger, it upgrades its safeguards in real time.\n\nThese advantages are apparent in CrowdStrike's financial results. Revenue leaped 33% year over year to $921 million in the quarter ended April 30. Free cash flow rose by an even more impressive 42% to $322 million.\n\nPartnerships with cloud computing giants should help to fuel CrowdStrike's expansion. On May 7, Microsoft agreed to use CrowdStrike's AI-powered threat-hunting services to bolster its Defender cybersecurity platform. Days later, CrowdStrike announced a strategic partnership with Alphabet. Google Cloud will deploy the cyber guardian's endpoint security and identity threat-detection technology to prevent breaches.\n\nThese collaborations should enable CrowdStrike to progress toward its goal of generating over $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, up from roughly $3.7 billion today. Yet that target will likely prove conservative. CrowdStrike sees its total market opportunity expanding to a whopping $225 billion by 2028.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Retirement may feel distant, but it\u2019s important to save up now. Accumulating more money will give you more choices when you are ready to retire. Even if you want to work forever, extra cash gives you more options about the type of work that you pursue.\n\nRetirement stocks can help investors reach their long-term financial goals sooner. Capital gains and dividends can lead to a higher net worth. Solid retirement stocks like the ones on this list can generate those results. These stocks have impressive records and have been around for a while. There\u2019s a time and place for high-risk, high-reward investment opportunities, but retirement stocks tend to offer more stability.\n\nInvestors should look for companies with multiple decades of experience, rising revenue, and improving profit margins. These components are the foundation for many top-tier retirement stocks. The stock market offers many choices, but investors who want stability and have multi-decade time horizons may want to consider these picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) GOOG stock: letters spelling out google\n\nSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) combines value with growth. The tech giant trades at a 27.5x price-to-earnings ratio while offering a 0.45% yield for investors. Shares are up by 27% year to date and gained 226% over the past five years.\n\nWhile the company makes most of its revenue from advertising, Google Cloud has become a larger segment of the corporation\u2019s business model. Google Cloud made up over 10% of the company\u2019s revenue in the first quarter. The quarter also featured 15% revenue growth from a year ago and 57% net income growth.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s net income should continue to exhibit an elevated growth rate as the company trims costs and becomes more efficient. Artificial intelligence can also lead to more revenue growth for the company. Gemini is Alphabet\u2019s response to ChatGPT, and AI can also increase demand for cloud computing platforms. A potential acquisition of HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) would expand Alphabet\u2019s offerings and can help the company reach new heights.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike\u2019s (NASDAQ:CRWD) current valuation doesn\u2019t resemble a retirement stock. The company trades at a P/E ratio north of 700x, but its 87x forward P/E ratio makes it look more reasonable.\n\nCrowdstrike continues to achieve impressive revenue growth while many competitors are struggling. Revenue increased by 33% year over year to reach $921 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Annual recurring revenue grew at the same rate, reaching $3.65 billion. Crowdstrike\u2019s annual recurring revenue gives it a good foundation to deliver compelling growth rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nNet income has been surging for the cybersecurity firm, and that can result in a more favorable P/E ratio for patient investors. Crowdstrike reported $500,000 in GAAP net income in Q1 2023. Meanwhile, GAAP net income came to $42.8 million in Q1 2024. Companies will have to invest more money to strengthen their digital defenses. Crowdstrike looks like a top beneficiary of this trend, and investors with a five- to 10-year horizon can be greatly rewarded.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc.

The company presents \u201cgrowth at a reasonable price,\u201d as it trades at a P/E ratio of 34x. Other fast-growing restaurant stocks have much higher P/E ratios. Texas Roadhouse stock is up by 42% in 2024 and has more than tripled over the past five years. Investors receive a 1.4% yield while they wait for the stock price to rally.\n\nRecent financial results suggest Texas Roadhouse can continue with its growth streak. Revenue increased by 12.5% year over year in the first quarter while net income sprang up by 31.4% year over year. Texas Roadhouse commanded an 8.4% year-over-year increase in comparable restaurant sales at company-owned restaurants. Comparable franchise restaurant sales were up by 7.7% year over year.\n\nTexas Roadhouse currently has 753 total restaurants. The split comes to 644 company-owned restaurants and 109 franchise-owned restaurants. The restaurant chain opened 12 additional restaurants this quarter.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle, CMG stock\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you want to diversify into multiple fast-food restaurant stocks, you may also want to consider Chipotle (NYSE:CMG). The restaurant chain has healthier food options than most fast food giants. This distinction helped Chipotle set higher prices for its food without losing customers.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock is up by 39% year-to-date leading to its 50-for-1 stock split that will take effect June 26. Shares also gained 322% over the past five years. Financials continue to be an area of strength for the chain. Revenue increased by 14.1% in the last year to $2.7 billion in the first quarter. Net income grew by 23.2% to $359.3 million. Chipotle closed the quarter with a 13.3% net profit margin, which is above average.\n\nChipotle remains on pace to open 285 to 315 new restaurants this year. Each time Chipotle opens that many restaurants, the company puts itself in a good financial position to open more in the following years. It\u2019s feasible to see Chipotle open more than 1,000 new restaurants before 2030. That development should result in meaningful gains for long-term investors.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is a leading credit and debit card issuer that charges a percentage of every transaction. These plastic cards are more convenient than cash and offer enticing rewards and enhanced security.\n\nDebit and credit cards will be used across multiple generations, and that should result in steady revenue growth for Visa. The fintech firm reported 10% year-over-year improvements to its revenue and net income in the second quarter . Visa\u2019s leadership regularly rewards shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks. The company allocated $3.8 billion in the most recent quarter toward those initiatives.\n\nVisa only has a 0.7% yield, but it maintained an annualized 18% growth rate over the past decade. This high growth rate can result in significant cash flow by the time you are ready to retire. Visa stock is up by 6% year to date and gained 62% over the past five years. The firm regularly has net profit margins that exceed 50%.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) outperformed the S&P 500 with a 26% year-to-date gain. Shares of the global retailer are up by 84% over the past five years. While Walmart is a reliable resource for groceries and affordable prices, the company is dabbling in two verticals that can stimulate growth.\n\nE-commerce is the first exciting opportunity. While Walmart reported 6% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, e-commerce was up by 21%. Walmart\u2019s continued success in e-commerce can help it compete with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and it can gobble up market share from Target (NYSE:TGT).\n\nWalmart\u2019s advertising segment is another area of strength, but it will take longer for advertising to meaningfully impact Walmart\u2019s financials. Advertising increased by 24% year over year, including a 26% growth rate for Walmart Connect in the U.S. Investors with lengthy time horizons can see advertising impact Walmart\u2019s profit margins meaningfully. Most of Walmart\u2019s business model revolves around low-margin sales. Growth in Walmart\u2019s advertising segment should translate into healthier profit margins.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been a top online advertising stock for several years. While a poor 2022 resulted in a meaningful price cut, the company flipped the script last year and recently touched an all-time high. Shares are up by 45% year-to-date and gained 177% over the past five years.\n\nJust like Alphabet, Meta Platforms trades at a reasonable valuation. Meta Platforms has a P/E of 29x and offers a 0.4% yield. Recent financial results suggest that Meta Platforms can become more affordable for long-term investors.\n\nRevenue increased by 27% year over year while net income was up by 117%. Meta Platforms continues to trim its headcount, which is 10% lower now than it was last year. Meta Platforms also wrapped up the quarter with $58.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The social media giant has plenty of capital to invest in new ventures while generating healthy profit margins for its investors.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in GOOG, CRWD, and TXRH.

        "title": "Brokers Suggest Investing in CrowdStrike (CRWD): Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD).\n\nCrowdStrike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.17, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 42 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.17 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 42 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 37 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 88.1% and 7.1% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CRWD Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRWD\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for CrowdStrike here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying CrowdStrike, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in CRWD?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for CrowdStrike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 18.2% over the past month to $3.98.\n\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for CrowdStrike. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for CrowdStrike with a grain of salt.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Growth stocks are attractive assets for investors who want to outperform the stock market. These companies typically exhibit high revenue growth and rising profit margins. Checking\u00a0both of\u00a0these boxes for many quarters can result in sizable long-term gains.\n\nHowever, investing in growth stocks can also go\u00a0horribly\u00a0wrong. Many pandemic darlings that soared to prominence in 2020 and 2021 became footnotes in the stock market after a challenging 2022. Companies that previously looked unstoppable have lost market share to their rivals.\n\nSome growth stocks are one-hit wonders that quickly fizzle out once the conditions change. Other growth stocks are built to thrive in various economic cycles and have endured\u00a0plenty of\u00a0challenges. They\u2019re also more financially sound and\u00a0look ready to deliver impressive gains for long-term investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors may benefit from monitoring these promising growth stocks. These promising companies have the potential to take your portfolio to new heights.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has\u00a0been drawing plenty of\u00a0attention for several years.\u00a0The cybersecurity stock has\u00a0been consistently outperforming\u00a0the stock market, but\u00a0the company\u2019s\u00a0strong finish to 2023 made it the top cybersecurity stock.\n\nWhile other cybersecurity firms reported slower revenue growth and mentioned headwinds in their earnings reports, Crowdstrike didn\u2019t endure any of those problems in Q4 FY24. That quarter wasn\u2019t just a one-hit wonder.\n\nCrowdstrike recently released Q1 FY25 results which indicated that the high growth rates are still intact. Revenue increased by 33% year-over-year to reach $921.0 million. Annual recurring revenue was\u00a0also up by\u00a033% year-over-year and reached $3.65 billion. These growth rates are almost identical to\u00a0what the company reported\u00a0in Q4 FY24. Guidance suggests that revenue growth will remain above 30% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nCrowdstrike also reported $42.8 million in GAAP net income attributable to the company. That\u2019s a big turnaround from the $500,000 profit in Q1 FY24.\n\nCrocs (CROX) The front of a Crocs (CROX) store in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\n\nSource: Wannee_photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrocs (NASDAQ:CROX) has enjoyed a multi-year renaissance after becoming a fad in the early 2000s. The stock has outperformed many big tech companies with a 58% year-to-date gain. Shares are also up by more than 650% over the past five years and trade at a reasonable 11.5 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s\u00a0first-quarter results indicate that demand is still strong. Revenue increased by 6% year-over-year\u00a0while diluted earnings-per-share was up by 5% year-over-year. The American shoe company experienced strong demand in domestic and international markets. The HEYDUDE Brand\u2019s revenue dropped by 17.2% year-over-year to $195 million\u00a0while\u00a0Crocs Brand sales increased by 14.6% year-over-year to reach $744 million.\n\nThe faster-growing segment makes up\u00a0the majority\u00a0of Crocs\u2019 revenue, and leadership is\u00a0making efforts\u00a0to reignite growth in the HEYDUDE segment.\u00a0Notably, Crocs Brand international sales increased by 21.3% year-over-year. Leadership anticipates that Crocs Brand revenue will increase by 7% to 9% in fiscal 2024 while HEYDUDE brand sales decrease by 8% to 10% year-over-year.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s hard to talk about growth stocks without mentioning the AI giant that has captured headlines.\u00a0Nvidia(NASDAQ:NVDA) recently touched the $3 trillion milestone for the first time and is on its way to taking the crown from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The stock has\u00a0some\u00a0serious momentum due to its impressive financial results and the upcoming 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nAs if 2023 wasn\u2019t good enough, Nvidia is up by more than 150% year-to-date. The semiconductor firm has also gained\u00a0more than\u00a03,000% over the past five years. Strong financials support the recent moves. Revenue increased by 262% year-over-year in\u00a0Q1 FY25 while net income surged by 628% year-over-year.\n\nNvidia should continue to enjoy the tailwinds of artificial intelligence as\u00a0corporations pour more money into the technology. Artificial intelligence is changing how companies operate. It\u2019s increasing productivity and enabling more solutions for customers. The new technology is becoming more valuable with every passing year, and Nvidia is the leader in this area.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another artificial intelligence stock. The company has been using AI to offer personalized search results for decades. Gemini presents an opportunity for Alphabet to expand its market share in the AI industry, but the company already has a lot going for it.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s advertising channels remain unmatched, and Google Cloud is gaining market share in the high-growth cloud computing industry. Cloud services should gain more demand thanks to artificial intelligence.\n\nThe tech giant posted solid results in the\u00a0first quarter.\u00a0Revenue increased by 15% year-over-year while net income was up by 57% year-over-year. The company\u2019s significant profit margin expansion comes as it continues to practice\u00a0cost cuttingmeasures.\u00a0Alphabet is trimming its workforce and looking for other opportunities to keep expenses low. Those recent decisions contributed to the firm\u2019s first quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. Alphabet stock has more than tripled over the past five years and is up\u00a0by\u00a028% year-to-date.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) has been growing at a rapid pace. Revenue increased by 45% year-over-year in the first quarter while net income\u00a0came to\u00a0$27.0 million. The educational tech company reported a net loss of $2.6 million in the same period last year.\n\nRising revenue and profit margins are a good combination, but investors haven\u2019t noticed\u00a0quite\u00a0yet. The stock is down by roughly 10% year-to-date and has gained 38% over the past five years. The main thing holding back Duolingo is its lofty valuation. It has a 201 P/E ratio although surging profits should make the valuation more reasonable very soon.\n\nThe app is a great resource for people who want to learn a new language. It guides people through verbal and written activities, and many users have noticed\u00a0the app\u2019s\u00a0quality. Almost 100 million people use the app each month, and 31.4 million people use\u00a0the app\u00a0every day.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMany businesses want to rank well on Google. Getting top positions for\u00a0important\u00a0keywords can result in a steady stream of targeted traffic to a company\u2019s website. Businesses can\u00a0then\u00a0convert new visitors into leads with good user experiences, but it all starts with crafting the right strategy.\n\nMany businesses\u00a0are using\u00a0Semrush (NYSE:SEMR) to assist with shaping their content strategies. The tool offers many features, such as\u00a0the ability to discover\u00a0optimal keywords.\u00a0Companies can use Semrush to plan out content that generates more traffic, and it can also\u00a0help with advertising campaigns.\n\nThe stock has more than doubled over the past year and is up by 20% year-to-date. The search engine marketing firm recently reported financials that suggest growth will continue.\u00a0Revenue increased by 21% year-over-year in the\u00a0first quarter with a net income of\u00a0$2.1 million. The company closed out the quarter with nearly 112,000 paying customers which is a 10% year-over-year improvement.\n\nHubSpot (HUBS) Hubspot (HUBS) logo displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nHubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is a customer relationship management tool that generates\u00a0steady\u00a0recurring revenue. It\u2019s also been accumulating solid returns for long-term investors. The stock is up\u00a0by\u00a09% year-to-date and has soared by 243% over the past five years. It\u2019s still roughly 30% removed from its all-time high, but recent improvements to revenue and profits suggest HubSpot can reclaim its peak levels.\n\nRevenue increased by 23% year-over-year in the\u00a0first quarter to\u00a0reach\u00a0$617.4 million. The company also transitioned to profitability with $5.9 million in net income during the quarter. That\u2019s a big turnaround from a $36.6 million net loss in Q1 2023.\n\nHubSpot has a lot going for it that can lead to a higher share price. However, the tech firm has some help. Swirling rumors about a potential Alphabet acquisition\u00a0are bringing\u00a0more attention to the stock. While there aren\u2019t many public details about the negotiations,\u00a0talks about a deal are building. It\u2019s even\u00a0been speculated\u00a0that HubSpot recently hired financial advisors to help\u00a0out with mapping\u00a0out a deal. These news developments can bring more investors to the stock and compound its recent gains.\n\nOn this\u00a0date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CRWD, NVDA, and GOOG.

        "title": "Nvidia Has Completed Its 10-for-1 Stock Split: 2 Hypergrowth Stocks Are Dark Horse Candidates to Follow in Its Footsteps",
        "content": "For more than a year, the two hottest trends on Wall Street have been the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and investors' newfound love for companies enacting stock splits. Last week, these two trends collided when AI titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)completed a 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nA stock split is a purely cosmetic event that alters a company's share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. In Nvidia's case, it increased the company's share count by a factor of 10 while reducing its share price to 1/10th of what it had been trading at. Stock splits have no impact on a company's market cap or its underlying operations. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStock splits also come in two flavors: forward and reverse. A forward-stock split, which is what Nvidia just conducted, is designed to make shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors. A single share of Nvidia now costs around $120, compared to $1,200 during the previous week.\n\nMeanwhile, the purpose of a reverse-stock split is to increase a company's share price. This is typically done to ensure that minimum listing standards on major stock exchanges are met.\n\nSince 2024 began, more than a half-dozen high-flying businesses with well-defined competitive advantages have conducted forward-stock splits. AI juggernaut Nvidia just happens to be the most high-profile of the bunch.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have rapidly become the standard in AI-accelerated data centers, fueling a 700%-plus increase in the company's share price since 2023 began. With demand for the company's H100 GPUs handily outpacing supply, Nvidia has had no trouble raising the price of these units and increasing its gross margin to an eye-popping 78.35% in the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28). In other words, splitting its stock for a second time since July 2021 was a no-brainer decision for Nvidia's board.\n\nHowever, Nvidia is unlikely to be the only fast-paced stock to complete a split in 2024. While there are a number of logical candidates to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock, including Costco Wholesale, Broadcom, and Meta Platforms, there are two rapidly growing dark horse candidates that may be likeliest to follow in Nvidia's footsteps. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings\n\nThe first hypergrowth stock that could surprise Wall Street and become the next stock-split stock is endpoint cybersecurity leader CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD). CrowdStrike has never conducted a stock split, but its shares moved up to nearly $370 in after-hours trading on June 7, following the announcement that it was being added to the benchmark S&P 500.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019, CrowdStrike has returned more than 500% for its shareholders. This is a reflection of changing variables in the cybersecurity space, as well as its unique innovation and superior platform.\n\nThe beauty of cybersecurity solutions is that they've evolved from optional to necessary. Businesses with an online or cloud-based presence are increasingly relying on third-party cybersecurity companies to fight back against hackers and robots that don't take any time off and don't care how well or poorly the U.S. and global economy are performing. According to CrowdStrike, its total addressable market is expected to more than double from $100 billion in 2024 to $225 billion by 2028.\n\nThe secret sauce that's made CrowdStrike such a success is its cloud-native, AI- and machine learning-driven platform known as Falcon. Every week, Falcon is overseeing trillions of events and becoming progressively smarter when it comes to identifying and responding to potential threats.\n\nWhat's particularly noteworthy about CrowdStrike is its retention rate. CrowdStrike's software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions aren't anywhere close to the cheapest on the market. Yet its retention rate has consistently hovered around 98%. Businesses have demonstrated a willingness to pay more for a premium product, which is what CrowdStrike offers.\n\nFurthermore, CrowdStrike is reaping the rewards of add-on sales. As of the end of the company's fiscal first quarter (April 30), 65% of its clients had purchased at least five cloud modules. Its SaaS model delivered an 80% adjusted subscription gross margin in fiscal 2024 (ended in late January), which suggests CrowdStrike's supercharged sales and earnings growth rates are sustainable.\n\nVisa\n\nThe other hypergrowth company that's a dark horse candidate to walk in Nvidia's footsteps and become Wall Street's next stock-split stock is payment-processing colossus Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nSince Visa's IPO in March 2008, the company has completed one forward split (4-for-1 in March 2015). What's interesting about this split is that it occurred when Visa was trading at roughly $268 per share. The stock ended last week at nearly $279, and topped $290 per share three months ago. Based on what its board has historically done, a stock split would seem likely.\n\nAdditionally, Visa's employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) allows its workers to purchase shares at up to a 15% discount. Just as Walmart and Chipotle Mexican Grill announced forward splits earlier this year to encourage employees to participate in their respective ESPPs, Visa might be enticed to do the same.\n\nPerhaps the best thing about Visa's operating model is that time is very much in its corner. Although recessions are a normal and inevitable aspect of the economic cycle, the phases of this cycle usually differ in length. Whereas a majority of U.S. economic downturns have resolved in under a year since the end of World War II, the typical expansion endures for multiple years. This lets Visa reap the rewards of consumers and businesses spending more during long-tailed growth phases.\n\nAnother reason investors can confidently place their trust in Visa over the long run has been management's decision to steer clear of lending activity. While I have little doubt that Visa would be a successful lender on brand name alone, doing so would expose the company to credit delinquencies and loan losses during a recession. By strictly focusing on payment facilitation, the company avoids the need to set aside capital to cover potential loan losses. This decision is why its profit margin has stayed above 50%!\n\nThe Visa growth story is also about international expansion. On top of being the undisputed leader in credit card network purchase volume in the U.S., Visa is staring down a multidecade opportunity to organically or acquisitively expand into chronically underbanked emerging market regions, which includes the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia. Visa's growth runway genuinely extends for decades to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "It\u2019s not every day when a stock generates triple-digit returns. Some investors dig through hundreds of stocks to discover which ones have the potential to deliver triple-digit returns. It takes a lot of research to find stocks with that type of potential, but even then, not all of them live up to expectations.\n\nInvestors should look for several characteristics when they analyze growth stocks. Rising revenue is a must. If a company isn\u2019t growing, there\u2019s no reason to expect its stock price to magically grow. Rising profit margins is another key element. Some corporations deliver exceptional sales growth but burn through a lot of money. Unprofitable companies are unsustainable in the long run and need to become profitable in the near future.\n\nFinally, investors should assess each company\u2019s growth opportunities. Was a strong quarter from last year a fluke, or is the company for real? These factors, combined with peeking at the company\u2019s valuation, can increase the likelihood of finding stocks poised for triple-digit returns. These picks look promising.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nConsolidated Water Co. (CWCO) A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.\n\nSource: HQuality/ShutterStock.com\n\nConsolidated Water Co. (NASDAQ:CWCO) is a leading designer, builder and operator of advanced water supply and treatment plants. The company has had several quarters of impressive revenue growth and continued that trend in the first quarter. Total revenue increased by 21% year-over-year (YOY) to reach $39.7 million while net income came in at $6.9 million. That\u2019s a 68.3% YOY improvement from the $4.1 million in GAAP net income in Q1 of 2023.\n\nThe profitable utility company trades at a 12.5 P/E ratio and offers a 1.50% yield. In addition, the company has a solid dividend growth rate. Consolidated Water Co. raised its dividend by 11.8% in Q4 of 2023. A high dividend growth is a good sign that indicates the company is doing just fine with sustainable growth. Currently, the quarterly dividend stands at $0.095 per share.\n\nAlthough shares are down by almost 30% year-to-date (YTD), CWCO stock is up by 85% over the past five years. The firm only has a $400 million market cap and remains a hidden gem. Profit margins are comfortably in the double-digits.\n\nComfort Systems USA (FIX) Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room. commercial real estate\n\nSource: GaudiLab / Shutterstock\n\nComfort Systems USA (NYSE:FIX) helps commercial and industrial clients with heating, ventilation and air conditioning installations. Also, the company offers repair and maintenance services as needed.\n\nFIX only has an $11 billion market cap and trades at a 30 P/E ratio. It also has a 0.39% yield and an impressive dividend growth rate. The company usually raises its dividend twice per year and recently hiked its quarterly dividend by 20%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWondering how Comfort Systems USA maintains a high dividend growth rate? It comes down to impressive financials. Revenue increased by 31% YOY in Q1 of 2024 to reach $1.54 billion. Net income came in at $96.3 million which represents a 68.3% YOY increase. A $5.91 billion backlog suggests that the gains should keep on rolling, and the stock has certainly been doing well. Shares are up by 52% YTD and have soared by 528% over the past five years.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity leader that was recently added to the S&P 500. The company boasts $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue and grew its revenue by 33% YOY in Q1 of 2025.\n\nThis growth comes amid a general slowdown in the cybersecurity industry. Investors should take note of this, since over-performance with headwinds suggests meaningful growth when headwinds exit.\n\nAlso, net income has been a bright spot for the company. Crowdstrike\u2019s $42.8 million in GAAP net income is a big jump from the $0.5 million GAAP net income in Q1 of 2024. Crowdstrike has partnerships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and other leading tech companies.\n\nThe stock\u2019s market cap is just shy of $100 billion, but recent momentum suggests Crowdstrike will break that barrier soon enough. Shares are up by 52% YTD and have surged by 484% over the past five years!\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in FIX and CRWD.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Next Bull Run: June 2024",
        "content": "The tech industry has been powering the stock market to all-time highs.\u00a0If you look\u00a0at the top holdings in the\u00a0S&P 500, you will see plenty of tech companies. Most of the Magnificent Seven stocks are tech companies, and they even have a\u00a0special\u00a0ETF that has been outperforming the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. This fund, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NASDAQ:MAGS)\u00a0demonstrates what\u2019s possible in tech.\n\nHowever, you don\u2019t have to buy tech giants to outperform the stock market.\u00a0In fact,\u00a0some investors would argue that you can get more gains by focusing on smaller corporations. Granted, we\u2019re still talking about companies with market caps approaching $100 billion, so they\u2019re not petite.\n\nTech is\u00a0a common\u00a0standout in bullish economic cycles. Many tech firms\u00a0have the ability to\u00a0scale in ways that are difficult for other sectors. With that in mind, these tech stocks look poised to deliver impressive returns during the next bull run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCorporations and small businesses need to keep themselves safe from cyberattacks. A breach can cost millions of dollars between stolen data, lost business, legal fees and other costs.\n\nRather than deal with all of those expenses, companies are turning to cybersecurity firms like\u00a0Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) to protect their data.\n\nThe Crowdstrike Falcon Platform helps businesses detect\u00a0threats and address them\u00a0before they get serious. Crowdstrike also identifies several ways to fortify your cybersecurity, and the company even uses AI to act as an additional safeguard against hackers.\n\nThe cybersecurity industry has endured some headwinds in recent quarters, but none\u00a0of those headwinds have slowed down\u00a0Crowdstrike\u2019s growth.\u00a0Revenue increased by 33% year-over-year in\u00a0Q1 FY25,\u00a0while\u00a0net income\u00a0came to\u00a0$42.8 million.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that other cybersecurity firms are decelerating in meaningful ways to regain growth. Crowdstrike has been using this opportunity to gain market share, and\u00a0it\u2019s possible for growth rates to accelerate\u00a0once the headwinds go away.\n\nUpwork (UPWK) The logo for Upwork (UPWK) is displayed on a cellphone.\n\nSource: Funstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nUpwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) has been a storied stock since the pandemic.\u00a0In roughly one year,\u00a0Upwork went from trading at $5 a share to exceeding $60 at its all-time high.\n\nRemote work has become more popular, and many people use Upwork to find job opportunities. However, the stock got\u00a0a bit\u00a0ahead of itself during that rally and is down by more than 80% from its peak.\n\nStory continues\n\nA few things have changed at Upwork ever since many investors tuned out. The company is\u00a0now\u00a0profitable and recently delivered $18.4 million in net income in\u00a0Q1 2024. That\u2019s a 7.4% year-over-year improvement.\u00a0Revenue was up by 19% year-over-year in that quarter\u00a0and came to\u00a0$190.9 million.\n\nAfter sliding by 27% to start the year, the stock\u00a0now\u00a0has a 31 P/E ratio. Upwork is still generating plenty of demand. Active clients increased by 5% year-over-year to exceed 872,000. As remote work and freelancing become commonplace, Upwork should continue to grow.\n\nUpwork also has a few exciting monetization opportunities.\u00a0Its Freelancer Plus subscription service now has 100,000 active subscribers\u00a0and generated\u00a076% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nAd revenue surged by 93% year-over-year and is the company\u2019s fastest-growing revenue stream. Advertisements are also known for their high-profit margins and can translate into a lower P/E ratio for the stock.\n\nThe company\u2019s Q2 revenue guidance ranges from $190 million to $195 million. It represents\u00a0a 14.2% year-over-year growth rate at the midpoint.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nMillions of people learn new languages every year.\u00a0Some\u00a0people pick it up\u00a0as a hobby while others use language learning apps and resources to acclimate themselves to new cultures.\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is a popular educational app that makes it easy and affordable for people to learn new languages.\n\nThe app guides users through written and verbal exercises designed to teach them basic concepts. Then, the lessons become more advanced as you progress through the app. Duolingo currently has\u00a097.6 million monthly active users,\u00a0as well as\u00a031.4 million daily active users. The app gets a lot of activity, and the engagement has translated into impressive financial growth.\n\nRevenue increased by 45% year-over-year in Q1 2024 to\u00a0reach\u00a0$167.6 million. Net income came in at $27.0 million compared to a $2.6 million net loss in the same period last year. Profit margins are expanding\u00a0and\u00a0revenue growth remains strong.\n\nWhile the stock is only up by 42% over the past five years, its fortunes should turn around quickly.\n\nOn this\u00a0date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in CRWD. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMarc Guberti is a finance freelance writer at InvestorPlace.com who hosts the Breakthrough Success Podcast.

        "title": "4 Best Stocks to Buy and 3 Best Stocks to Sell: June 2024",
        "content": "It remains a tale of two markets. Some stocks have wind in their sails and are soaring to all-time highs. But others are paddling along and stuck at 52-week lows. In this market, a rising tide is not lifting all boats. Fundamentals and financial results continue to drive performance in the current market. Companies that beat targets with their earnings and have catalysts at work are seeing their share prices rise sharply.\n\nConversely, companies that miss earnings estimates and lack any catalysts are being punished and their share prices sent downward. This requires investors to be savvy with their stock picking among publicly traded companies.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the four best stocks to buy and the three best stocks to sell this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been ignited by the company\u2019s long-awaited artificial intelligence (AI) strategy. After initially dropping 2%, the stock rallied 7% higher the day after the AI strategy was unveiled. It hit close to its all-time high. The stock\u2019s big move comes after Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Tim Cook announced a revamped Siri digital assistant and the addition of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT technology to future iPhones.\n\nInvestors initially seemed concerned that Apple\u2019s AI approach focused too much on consumers rather than on enterprise customers. However, sentiment quickly changed after several analysts who cover the company issued bullish reports. Those comments indicated that the AI strategy is likely to lead Apple\u2019s billion users to upgrade to next generation iPhones. And this will create a huge sales boost for the technology giant.\n\nCurrently, Apple stock is up 12% on the year and looks to have its mojo back.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nPharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) appears to have a new blockbuster drug coming to market. A panel of independent advisors to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended Eli Lilly\u2019s new Alzheimer\u2019s drug called \u201cDonanemab.\u201d This clears the way for the medication to receive regulatory approval later this year. Donanemab will give Eli Lilly another potential blockbuster drug at a time when it is seeing brisk sales of its Zepbound weight loss medication.\n\nOnce approved, Donanemab will be only the second Alzheimer\u2019s drug of its kind that\u2019s available in the U.S. Their rival Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) has a treatment called \u201cLeqembi. Donanemab is viewed by many in the medical profession as a milestone in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s. Decades of efforts failed to develop medicines that can fight the disease. In a unanimous vote, 11 members on the FDA panel said data on the Alzheimer\u2019s drug shows that it is effective at treating patients in early stages of the disease.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, LLY stock has risen 94% in the past 12 months and is currently near an all-time high.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings\u2019 (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock is on a tear after the company issued strong Q1 financial results. Also, its stock is being added to the benchmark S&P 500 index. In a little more than a week, CRWD stock has risen 15%, bringing its year-to-date (YTD) gain to 56%. The stock has now risen an incredible 500% over the past five years! Clearly, it distinguishes itself as the leading cybersecurity concern.\n\nTherefore, news of the S&P inclusion lifted CRWD stock as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds that track the index are forced to buy shares of the company. The S&P 500 nod comes after CrowdStrike reported Q1 EPS of 93 cents. This is far above the 89 cents expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $921 million, ahead of estimates of $905 million. CrowdStrike\u2019s free cash flow stood at $322.5 million, up 42% from a year ago.\n\nAll the good news makes CrowdStrike one of the best stocks to buy now.\n\nThe Gap (GPS) GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother stock that has rallied hard based on its strong financial results is retailer The Gap (NYSE:GPS). Following a string of better-than-expected prints, GPS has increased an incredible 175% over the last 12 months. Yet, its shares still trade under $30. Also, the company\u2019s valuation sits at 15 times forward earnings estimates. The stock pays a dividend of 15 cents a share per quarter, giving it a yield of 2.24%.\n\nIn late May, Gap stock jumped 23% higher after the clothing retailer reported stellar Q1 financial results and raised its full-year guidance. Gap CEO Richard Dickson has undertaken a turnaround strategy that is clearly working. Dickson has said that his management team is focused on brand storytelling, celebrity endorsements and positioning the Gap at the centre of culture.\n\nStocks to Sell: UiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nA stock that investors should stay far away from is software company UiPath (NYSE:PATH). Recently, shares of the troubled tech company fell 30% in a day after it was announced that the CEO had departed. UiPath, which makes robotic process automation software, said that CEO Rob Enslin resigned on June 1 and has been replaced by company co-founder Daniel Dines. Before this year, Dines had served as co-CEO of UiPath.\n\nEnslin\u2019s resignation comes as UiPath\u2019s stock has declined 84% since the company went public in 2021, including a 50% YTD drop. Additionally, the company\u2019s Q1 financial results were revealed. Despite beating Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines, UiPath lowered its full-year guidance. The company says it expects revenue of $1.405 billion to $1.41 billion. That is significantly down from previous guidance that called for $1.55 billion to $1.56 billion in sales. Moreover, analysts have been downgrading PATH stock in recent weeks.\n\nTarget (TGT) an image of bullseye the target dog in a target store\n\nSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong retailers, Target (NYSE:TGT) continues to struggle. TGT stock is up only 2% this year. The discount department store\u2019s share price fell 10% after it posted mixed Q1 financial results and said that consumers are buying fewer discretionary items. Target reported EPS of $2.03 versus $2.06 that was forecast on wall Street. The latest print marked the first time since November 2022 that Target missed profit expectations.\n\nRevenue in Q1 totaled $24.53 billion, slightly edging estimates of $24.52 billion. Target\u2019s sales were down 3% from a year ago. Customer traffic, which includes online and in-store shopping, fell 1.9% in Q1. In addition, the average amount that customers spent per visit declined 2%. Same-store sales decreased 3.7% as shoppers bought fewer items such as apparel and products for the home.\n\nTo attract price sensitive consumers, Target has relaunched its loyalty rewards program. Also, it announced price cutbacks on thousands of items, including milk and diapers. It remains to be seen if the strategy will help Target moving forward.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify (SHOP) on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce company Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is having a bad year.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock plunged 18% after it reported a surprise loss for its fiscal first quarter. SHOP stock is down 14% on the year. The company shocked markets when it announced a loss of 21 cents per share. That was much worse than a profit of 9 cents that was the consensus expectation of analysts. Revenue in the quarter totaled $1.90 billion, which topped Wall Street estimates of $1.83 billion.\n\nThe surprise financial loss was blamed on the sale of Shopify\u2019s logistics business and related fees that the company incurred on the sale. Looking ahead, Shopify said that for fiscal Q2, revenue will grow at a high-teens percentage rate year-over-year (YOY). Wall Street was looking for a fiscal Q2 sales increase of 19%. SHOP stock remains 63% lower than its all-time high reached in November 2021 when the market last peaked.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in LLY.

        "title": "2 Super Cybersecurity Stocks (Other Than CrowdStrike) to Buy Hand Over Fist Today",
        "content": "According to research firm McKinsey, the corporate sector is poised to spend $213 billion on cybersecurity software in 2024. However, that isn't nearly enough to defend against what Cybersecurity Ventures believes will be $9.5 trillion worth of damage caused by cybercrime throughout the year.\n\nMcKinsey believes companies should be collectively spending $2 trillion each year instead, which leaves a gap of $1.8 trillion. That spells opportunity for cybersecurity vendors, because the sheer cost of cyberattacks will push an increasing number of businesses to invest more heavily in protection.\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) is the second-largest cybersecurity vendor in the world, with a market capitalization of $91 billion. However, it's growing its revenue twice as fast as the current leader, Palo Alto Networks, and could soon snatch first place considering its stock skyrocketed 147% in the past year alone.\n\nHowever, it will take more than one or two vendors to fill the enormous spending gap highlighted by McKinsey. Therefore, here's why investors might want to consider buying shares in SentinelOne (NYSE: S) and Tenable (NASDAQ: TENB) as well.\n\n1. SentinelOne: A powerhouse in automated protection\n\nSentinelOne believes machines can react to cyber incidents much faster than humans, so its Singularity platform is built with artificial intelligence (AI)-based automation at its core. It's a complete cybersecurity solution covering cloud networks, endpoints, and identity protection, with a host of unique features designed to save human employees time.\n\nSingularity's Storyline feature, for example, autonomously creates incident summaries complete with context, so managers don't have to spend hours conducting manual investigations. Its One-Click Remediation tool then allows managers to instantly roll back unauthorized changes to their organization's network in the event of a successful breach. Finally, Purple AI is a chatbot-style assistant integrated into Singularity that can uncover vulnerabilities and hunt for new threats on command.\n\nDuring the recent fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 30), SentinelOne generated $186 million in revenue, a 40% year-over-year jump. That meant it grew even faster than CrowdStrike, which delivered a revenue increase of 33% during the same period -- but CrowdStrike generated significantly more revenue ($921 million), which makes it harder to grow as quickly. Nevertheless, it's a sign SentinelOne might be taking some market share from its competitors.\n\nSentinelOne also generated $33.7 million in free cash flow during Q1, which is a non-GAAP measure of profitability. The combination of solid revenue growth and operating costs that only increased by 5.3% from the year-ago period were contributing factors to the result. SentinelOne never delivered positive free cash flow before Q1, so it was an important milestone.\n\nStory continues\n\nSentinelOne stock is down 77% from its all-time high, which was set during the 2021 tech frenzy. It was trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of more than 100 then, which was unsustainable, but it's now at a more reasonable 8.2. In fact, that looks like a bargain compared to CrowdStrike's P/S ratio of 28.1, especially considering SentinelOne's revenue is growing at a faster clip.\n\n2. Tenable: A leader in vulnerability management\n\nTenable is a specialist in the vulnerability management segment. Its Nessus platform is the most deployed solution of its kind in the industry. It proactively scans devices, networks, and operating systems in search of vulnerabilities so organizations can patch them before they are exploited by bad actors.\n\nHowever, Nessus has become more of an on-ramp into the broader Tenable ecosystem, which includes a growing number of mainstream cybersecurity products like cloud security and identity management. In fact, the company launched Tenable One in 2022, which is a consolidated solution designed to meet all of the cybersecurity needs of modern organizations.\n\nTenable One also includes a product called ExposureAI, which helps managers assess their risk posture, explains potential threats, and even recommends actions to improve outcomes. Tenable says it has the world's largest repository of contextual exposure data, and since data is the lifeblood of AI models, ExposureAI is positioned to be one of the most effective tools of its kind.\n\nTenable generated $216 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), which was a 14% increase from the year-ago period. It's growing relatively slowly because it's pulling back on its costs to focus on profitability instead, in order to build a more sustainable business for the long term. Its operating expenses increased by just 8% during Q1, resulting in a 42% reduction in its GAAP net loss, which came in at only $14.4 million.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which strips out one-off and non-cash expenses like stock-based compensation, Tenable's net income soared 133% to $30.4 million, so its strategy is certainly paying off.\n\nTenable stock is even cheaper than SentinelOne, with a P/S ratio of just 5.8. The company is growing its revenue at a slower pace than SentinelOne, but it's very close to achieving true GAAP profitability, which probably makes it a good buy for value investors with a more conservative risk profile. If McKinsey's forecasts for the cybersecurity industry prove to be accurate, Tenable will play a key role in filling the spending gap.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SentinelOne right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SentinelOne, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SentinelOne wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "As tech giants push major indexes to new highs, investors are seeking out the best tech stocks to buy for strong returns. The influence of tech juggernauts in the U.S. economy is undeniable. A recent story by Fortune Magazine says that tech will remain the economy\u2019s key growth engine. The article argues that the invention and proliferation of new technologies can improve standards of living while unlocking profits for companies that provide these solutions.\n\nThe dominance of tech in nearly every facet of life is reason enough to support the top names in the space. While Big Tech has powered recent gains in the economy, a group of smaller companies has helped push the S&P to new highs. This bodes well for investors eager to add more tech diversity to their portfolios.\n\nGiven the broad spectrum of tech stocks, let\u2019s focus on companies with the most exciting product launches for this story. I believe these tech innovations ultimately set the stage for long-term returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnce a relatively unknown name, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) quickly climbed up the tech ranks with its AI chips. After tripling its stock price since 2023, the company recently achieved a new milestone\u2014a $3 trillion market cap. This is a result of its dominant position in the AI chip market, with its technology worth tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nNvidia\u2019s latest price bump comes after the company announced the launch of the next generation of AI chips. Codenamed Blackwell, the chips are expected to be more advanced than their predecessor, the H100. Amidst a growing demand for generative AI technology, the sales from Blackwell will cement Nvidia\u2019s position as an AI leader. Nvidia\u2019s leather-jacketed CEO, Jensen Huang, says the chips will bring in a lot of revenue this year.\n\nI think NVDA\u2019s current share price presents a great entry point into the market. While critics may say the price is too high, I think the broad utility of its AI chips adds merit to its valuation.\n\nNvidia\u2019s strong position in the AI market puts this among the best tech stocks to buy for outsized returns.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Image of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise's building\n\nSource: zakiahza / Shutterstock.com\n\nHewlett Packard\u2019s (NYSE:HPE) recent AI-fueled results make it one of the best tech stocks to buy right now. In its recent earnings report, the PC giant reported revenue at $7.2 billion, up 3% from a year ago. One among several reasons for this strong performance can be attributed to its GreenLake tech as a service platform, which saw a 39% uptick in revenue to $15 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nA second reason for investor optimism in the stock comes from the demand for its AI servers. The meteoric rise of AI technology has proven to be immensely favorable for companies like HPE that power data centers with AI solutions. According to the company\u2019s CEO, processing Nvidia\u2019s new tab AI-powered chips now takes six to twelve weeks. The latest manufacturing timelines will enable HPE to ship out its backlog in the coming months. According to analysts, revenue from the sale of these chips will push the company\u2019s net worth up by $2 billion.\n\nHPE\u2019s much-awaited AI bump makes this the perfect time to get behind this name, with some predicting share prices as high as $23.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother company that\u2019s thriving amidst strong demand for generative AI technology is CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD). The cybersecurity giant came out on top in its recent earnings report, posting strong Q1 numbers. Revenue peaked at $921 million, up from $693 million a year ago. Several factors anchored CrowdStrike\u2019s impressive performance. This includes its subscription revenue, which accounts for most of its revenue growth. Subscriber revenue increased by 34% YOY to $872 million.\n\nA second tailwind for the company is the performance of its Unified Falcon Platform. The technology is designed to power the next generation of cybersecurity solutions with AI-generative tools. Its features include workflow automation, lightning-fast data transmission, and incident innovations. In its recent earnings call, the company alluded to the success of this platform, stating that \u201cit enables CrowdStrike to solve the industry\u2019s biggest cybersecurity, IT, and data problems.\u201d\n\nAdding to its strong performance this past quarter, the company also paints a rosy revenue outlook. Guidance for the next quarter will range from $958.3 million to $961.2 million, beating analysts\u2019 forecast of $954.4 million. CrowdStrike attributes this outlook to its differentiated cybersecurity platform, which could be a game-changer for companies in the AI era.\n\nCrowdstrike stands firm with consistent growth and is among the top tech stocks to buy in today\u2019s market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDivya has a background in finance and accounting and has worked in FP&A roles at Fortune 500 companies.

        "content": "The\u00a0S&P 500 has delivered solid long-term returns. The index periodically adds and removes stocks based on their overall performance to generate higher returns for long-term investors. However, the S&P 500 tends to add stocks to its index after they have enjoyed incredible rallies.\n\nSupermicro (NASDAQ:SMCI) and Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) joined the S&P 500 in Q1 2024. It made sense for these stocks to get added because they fulfilled the requirements and generated plenty of fanfare. However, most of the gains were already recorded.\n\nSupermicro is down since its inclusion to the S&P 500 despite logging a 4,400% gain over the past five years. Deckers Outdoor is up since joining the S&P 500, but investors missed out on a 500% gain over the past five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYou don\u2019t have to wait for stocks to join the S&P 500 before investing in them. These are some of the top growth stocks that can 10x by 2030.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) followed in the footsteps of Supermicro and Deckers Outdoor. It recently joined the S&P 500 and delivered most of its gains before joining the index. However, Crowdstrike can still deliver massive returns and has the potential to become a $1 trillion company in a decade.\n\nThe cybersecurity industry is projected to maintain a\u00a013.8% compounded annual growth rate from now until 2030. The rise of online hackers and artificial intelligence should boost the company\u2019s demand.\n\nAnother key factor working in Crowdstrike\u2019s factor is its solid earnings. Revenue increased by 33% year-over-year in\u00a0Q1 FY25 while net income surged from $0.5 million to $42.8 million. Rapidly rising profit margins are paving the way for a more reasonable valuation, and these financial results come at a time when most cybersecurity firms are struggling. Crowdstrike stands to accelerate revenue growth once headwinds subside. Though, you wouldn\u2019t know the cybersecurity industry had headwinds if you looked at Crowdstrike\u2019s financials.\n\nSezzle (SEZL) A close-up shot of a hand holding a sign that reads \"Buy Now, Pay Later.\"\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSezzle (NASDAQ:SEZL) is a fintech firm that specializes in \u201cBuy Now, Pay Later\u201d services. The stock is already up by roughly 300% year-to-date as its platform experiences robust growth. Revenue increased by 35.5% YOY in the first quarter. Net income more than quadrupled YOY to reach $8.01 million.\n\nThe firm trades at a 36 P/E ratio and is valued at under $500 million. Sezzle recently\u00a0joined the Russell 3000 Index.\u00a0 Sezzle would have to more than 10x to fulfill the S&P 500\u2019s requirements. It\u2019s hard to predict which stocks will 10x within a few years, but strong financials, a low market cap, and a reasonable P/E ratio give this company a chance.\n\nStory continues\n\nSezzle\u2019s\u00a0number of total subscribers surged from 142,000 in Q1 2023 to 371,000 in this most recent quarter. The total number of transactions is up by 45.9% YOY. The average quarterly purchase frequency per customer is up by roughly 50% YOY.\n\nCommvault Systems (CVLT) An image of a robot reaching toward a laptop, surrounded by chat bubbles and graphs\n\nSource: klyaksun/Shutterstock\n\nCommvault Systems (NASDAQ:CVLT) is in the right industry. It\u2019s also got a $5 billion market cap and a 31 P/E ratio. The cloud security company helps businesses manage their digital resources from one dashboard and keep hackers out of their databases.\n\nThe firm\u00a0wrapped up fiscal 2024 with 10% YOY revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Revenue growth for the entire year came in at 7% YOY. Commvault Systems needs higher revenue growth numbers to support a 10x stock price before 2030. However, net income and profit margins are rising. Commvault also has $770 million in total annual recurring revenue. That\u2019s a 16% YOY improvement.\n\nAlthough revenue acceleration is pivotal, the stock already has momentum on its side. Commvault Systems stock is up by 50% year-to-date.

        "content": "The S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is commonly regarded as the best benchmark for the overall U.S. stock market. The index tracks 500 large American companies that cover 80% of domestic equities by market capitalization. To be considered for inclusion, a company must be worth at least $18 billion, it must be profitable, and the stock must be sufficiently liquid.\n\nOn Monday, June 24, the S&P 500 will undergo its quarterly rebalancing. Before the market opens, CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), GoDaddy, and KKR will be added to the index, while Robert Half, Comerica, and Illumina will be removed. Of the new additions, CrowdStrike stands out for several reasons.\n\nIt is the company best positioned to monetize generative artificial intelligence software, a market forecasted to grow at 58% annually through 2028. It is also one of only three enterprise software companies guiding for 30%-plus revenue growth this year, according to Morgan Stanley. Finally, CrowdStrike ranked third on the 2023 Fortune Future 50 List, an annual assessment of the world's largest companies based on long-term growth prospects.\n\nIs the stock worth buying?\n\nCrowdStrike is building momentum beyond endpoint security\n\nCrowdStrike is the leader in modern endpoint security software, a cybersecurity category focused on protecting hardware like desktops, laptops, and mobile devices. Additionally, CrowdStrike is also gaining market share in modern endpoint security faster than any other vendor. The company will account for 28% of spending in fiscal 2027 (ends Jan. 31), up from 21% in fiscal 2024, according to estimates from JPMorgan Chase.\n\nStrength in endpoint security is particularly advantageous for two reasons. First, endpoint devices are the richest source of threat intelligence for enterprises. CrowdStrike uses its vast data to train \"the industry's most effective and accurate\" artificial intelligence (AI) models, according to CEO George Kurtz. Second, brand authority garnered from success in endpoint security is helping the company gain share in other cybersecurity markets.\n\nFor instance, CrowdStrike is the market leader in MDR (managed detection and response) services. Analysts have also praised the company as a technology leader in identity threat detection and cloud security. Additionally, CrowdStrike is seeing strong demand for new data protection and IT automation modules, and it has one of the fastest-growing SIEM (security information and event management) products on the market, according to CEO George Kurtz.\n\nTo further tap its data advantage, CrowdStrike recently debuted a generative AI assistant. The product, Charlotte AI, accelerates and streamlines security workflows by allowing users to ask questions in natural language. It can assess security posture, summarize threat intelligence, assist with investigations, and provide prescriptive guidance. Morgan Stanley analysts see CrowdStrike as one of the software companies best positioned to monetize generative AI due to its endpoint leadership and robust data.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike continued to execute in the first quarter\n\nCrowdStrike reported strong financial results in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 30), beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 33% to $921 million and non-GAAP net income increased 70% to $232 million. Management guided for 31% revenue growth in the second quarter.\n\nCEO George Kurtz said CrowdStrike's ability to consolidate a broad range of security workloads on a single platform is resonating with the market. He also said the number of deals involving cloud security, identity protection, and SIEM modules more than doubled compared to the prior year, highlighting momentum beyond endpoint security.\n\nThe chart shows CrowdStrike's revenue and non-GAAP net income over the last five quarters. CrowdStrike's revenue and non-GAAP net income over the last five quarters. The first quarter of fiscal 2025 ended April 30, 2024.\n\nCrowdStrike stock looks expensive compared to Wall Street's sales forecast\n\nCybersecurity is the IT budget category projected to see the second-largest increase in spending in 2024, according to a CIO survey from Morgan Stanley. Artificial intelligence is the only IT budget category expected to see a greater increase in spending.\n\nCrowdStrike is well positioned to benefit in both cases. Its purview is expanding beyond endpoint security, and Charlotte AI could evolve into a material revenue stream. To that end, Wall Street expects sales to grow at 27% annually over the next three years. That estimate leaves room for upside, but CrowdStrike still trades at an expensive valuation of 28 times sales.\n\nPersonally, I would wait for that multiple to drop a few points before purchasing the stock. That said, I am a CrowdStrike shareholder and I have no plans to sell my position.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "3 Cybersecurity Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "Growth stocks can help increase the value of your investment portfolio to achieve a comfortable retirement. However, you should be discerning in picking the right stocks to own for the long term. Some companies may falter and fall by the wayside while others may see their growth fizzle out after a while.\n\nBecause of these risks, it makes sense to look for stocks that are riding sustainable trends that can provide growth tailwinds for years or even decades. Cybersecurity is one of the sectors exhibiting strong demand and can allow the players within it to enjoy steady, long-term growth.\n\nWith more corporations moving to cloud platforms amid a wave of digitalization, cybersecurity is more imperative than ever for these businesses to ensure that their sensitive data is well protected. Here are three promising cybersecurity stocks that you can safely buy and own for the next decade. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCyberArk Software\n\nCyberArk Software(NASDAQ: CYBR) is an identity management company that provides comprehensive security screening across business applications, cloud platforms, and corporate workspaces.\n\nFor 2023, revenue climbed 27.1% year over year to $751.9 million, with gross profit improving by nearly 28% year over year to $595.8 million. Gross margin increased slightly from 78.7% to 79.2%. CyberArk also generated a positive free cash flow of $51.3 million for the year, an increase of 37.8% over the previous year's $37.2 million.\n\nThe momentum has carried over into the first quarter of this year as CyberArk reported a strong set of earnings. Revenue jumped 37% year over year to $221.6 million while gross profit surged 42.5% to $179.1 million, translating into a gross margin of nearly 81%. The identity management firm also churned out a free cash flow of $66.8 million, a sharp increase from the $4 million generated a year ago.\n\nOf the company's total revenue, 93% was recurring, with recurring revenue increasing by 41% year over year to $206 million. Annual recurring revenue also grew 34% year over year to $811 million.\n\nThere could be more growth in store for CyberArk after it announced the acquisition of Venafi for $1.54 billion in cash and stock. Venafi is a leader in machine identity management and through this acquisition, CyberArk's management hopes to establish a unified platform for enterprise-level machine identity security.\n\nNot only will this transaction immediately add to CyberArk's margins, but management believes there will be revenue synergies through cross-selling, up-selling, and geographic expansion. The purchase will also increase CyberArk's total addressable market (TAM) for identity security from the current $50 billion to around $60 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, the company is also embedding artificial intelligence capabilities across its identity security platform. This inclusion will enable customers to gain valuable insights and apply advanced identity threat detection to cut response times. With CyberArk's software becoming more attractive, this will result in stronger customer loyalty.\n\nFortinet\n\nFortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT) has an integrated portfolio of more than 50 enterprise-grade cybersecurity products. More than half a million customers use the company's products to secure people, data, and devices.\n\nThe company pulled off an impressive performance last year with revenue rising 20.1% year over year to $5.3 billion. Operating income climbed 28% to $1.2 billion with net income increasing by nearly 34% to $1.1 billion. The business also generated a positive free cash flow of $1.7 billion, up nearly 20%.\n\nFortinet continued performing well in the first quarter of this year. Revenue edged up 7.2% year over year to $1.3 billion while net income rose 20.8% to $299.3 million. The cybersecurity company generated $608.5 million of free cash flow for the quarter.\n\nThe company has also done well in returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks, with around $5.3 billion purchased since 2020, resulting in an 11.4% reduction in shares outstanding.\n\nFortinet has also incorporated generative artificial intelligence capabilities to allow for natural language processing functionality, allowing customers to boost their operating efficiency and simplifying the user interface.\n\nManagement has identified a TAM of $144 billion in 2024 that is set to grow to $222 billion in four years, providing ample opportunities for Fortinet to grow further.\n\nCrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) operates the CrowdStrike Falcon platform, which helps clients detect threats and protect data, providing them with protection and better performance.\n\nThe company has demonstrated robust growth with a 36.3% year-over-year increase in revenue to $3.1 billion for its fiscal 2024, ended Jan. 31. The business generated a net income of $89.2 million for the fiscal year, reversing the $183.2 million loss in the prior year. Free cash flow also improved by nearly 40% year over year to $940.2 million.\n\nThe first quarter of fiscal 2025 saw a similarly strong performance with CrowdStrike registering a 33% year-over-year increase in revenue to $921 million. Higher interest income and gains from investments propelled the company's net income to $42.8 million, significantly above the $491,000 reported in the preceding year. Free cash flow came in strong at $323.1 million, up nearly 42%.\n\nCrowdStrike is tapping into partnerships to fuel further growth. The company announced an expanded distribution agreement with Ignition Technology to deliver its cybersecurity platform to the latter's Nordic partner base. Together, both parties will identify threats and help organizations to stop breaches.\n\nThe company also inked a partnership with Google Cloud to transform artificial intelligence-native cybersecurity, working together to stop cloud intrusions and keep sensitive data secure.\n\nManagement has reported a TAM of $100 billion for 2024, which includes managed services, endpoint security, and threat intelligence, among other aspects. This TAM is expected to grow to $225 billion by 2028, allowing the Falcon platform to spread its wings and propel CrowdStrike's revenue and earnings higher in the years to come.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +17.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which CrowdStrike falls in, has gained 1.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nCrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.98 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +32.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8.5%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.98 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.8%. This estimate has changed -18.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.84 indicates a change of +21.4% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, CrowdStrike is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRWD _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $959.55 million indicates a year-over-year change of +31.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $4 billion and $5.01 billion estimates indicate +30.8% and +25.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $921.04 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +33%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.57 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $904.82 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.79%. The EPS surprise was +4.49%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks on the Brink of a 300% Return by 2028: June Edition",
        "content": "Tech stocks have been leading the stock market higher for several years. If you look at the top holdings in the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite, you\u2019ll notice that many of those corporations are in the tech sector. Almost every Magnificent Seven stock is in this industry, and corporations that aren\u2019t in the tech sector still use software and other resources.\n\nNon-tech companies still use technology, and many consumers use it as well. That\u2019s why many tech stocks have been delivering exceptional returns for investors. While some stocks keep up with the S&P 500, others trounce the index and look like they can continue.\n\nThe stocks on this list have rising revenue and profit margins. They have been crushing the S&P 500 and have enough tailwinds to support further gains for long-term investors. These are some of the top tech stocks that are on the brink of generational returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is the best cybersecurity stock right now. The firm continues to post impressive growth rates despite headwinds in the industry. Revenue increased by 33% year-over-year in Q1 FY25 to reach $921 million. CrowdStrike\u2019s $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue gives it the foundation to deliver better results in future quarters. The company even suggested that revenue growth should exceed 30% year-over-year in Q2 FY25.\n\nNet income came to $42.8 million compared to $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2024. This quarter was important for the firm as it closed out its most recent quarter profitability. Furthermore, it was profitable in fiscal 2024. Those key benchmarks made the company eligible for S&P 500 inclusion, and it is now part of the famed index. The stock rose by 5% in after hours upon the news.\n\nCrowdStrike has gained more than 40% year-to-date and has more than quintupled over the past five years. Past results don\u2019t guarantee future successes, but revenue and earnings growth remain strong. Once headwinds fade away, the stock should continue to accelerate its financial growth.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSynopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a semiconductor firm that produces silicon chips. These chips form the backbone for self-driving cars, machine learning, computers and other resources. The company has been in business for more than 35 years and generates over $5 billion in annual revenue.\n\nThe firm is making progress with its acquisition of Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS). Shareholders on both sides approved the deal and now Synopsys has to get through regulatory hurdles to make it official. Synopsys continues to grow at a solid pace while it waits for the acquisition to get finalized. Revenue increased by 15% year-over-year in Q2 FY24 while net income increased by 7% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street analysts are feeling confident that the stock can continue to overdeliver. It\u2019s currently rated a \u201cstrong buy\u201d with a projected 14% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $675 per share suggests that the stock can gain an additional 18% from current levels. Shares are up by 15% year-to-date and have gained 358% over the past five years.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is off to a challenging start with a 2% year-to-date gain. Part of the stock\u2019s decline was in sympathy to an earnings miss from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). The recent dip presents a long-term buying opportunity as the stock now trades at a 75 P/E ratio. While the year-to-date gain leaves much to be desired, ServiceNow has gained 157% over the past five years.\n\nThe company\u2019s cloud platform has a high 98% renewal rate and attracts the top corporations. ServiceNow has more than 8,100 customers which include roughly 85% of the Fortune 500. Almost 2,000 of these customers have annual contract values that exceed $1 million. Companies use ServiceNow\u2019s technology to create work flows, become more efficient and offer better customer experiences.\n\nServiceNow recently reported 24% year-over-year revenue growth. Most of these revenue is recurring, which suggests a strong foundation for future outperformance. ServiceNow indicated as much by raising its midpoint for 2024 subscription revenue guidance. Net income more than doubled year-over-year to reach $347 million. As revenue and profit margins continue to grow, ServiceNow should reward long-term investors.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CRWD, SNPS and NOW.

But right now, the three best stocks to buy in June can help lift a portfolio.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares became much more affordable after a 10-for-1 stock split. Sure, the fundamentals of the company haven\u2019t changed. But the cost to buy one share of the microchip and semiconductor company just went from $1,200 to $120. The current share price is about as low as investors will be able to buy Nvidia stock for the foreseeable future. This is, after all, a company that recently reported a 600% year-over-year rise in its quarterly profit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe stock split occurs as Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization tops $3 trillion, making the company the world\u2019s second most valuable publicly traded concern after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Additionally, analysts say the stock split could lead to Nvidia being added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), though no announcement has been made. Some analysts speculate that Nvidia could replace competing chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the Dow 30 index.\n\nNvidia\u2019s stock has rallied 30% higher since the stock split was announced on May 22, along with blockbuster first-quarter financial results. So far, in 2024, NVDA stock is up 150%.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) looks like a buy after the cybersecurity firm reported first-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street estimates. The company, which has distinguished itself among cybersecurity stocks, reported EPS of $0.93, above the $0.89 expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $921 million, up 34% from a year ago and ahead of estimates calling for $905 million in sales.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s free cash flow stood at $322.5 million at the quarter\u2019s end, up 42% from $227.4 million a year earlier, and its subscription revenue grew 34% to $872.2 million. Regarding guidance, CrowdStrike expects revenue of $958.1 million to $961.2 million in the second quarter. The guidance is ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $955 million. Profits are forecast at $0.98 to $0.99 per share, above consensus forecasts of $0.91.\n\nStory continues\n\nCRWD stock has gained 130% over the last 12 months, including a 41% increase this year.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nSome market observers say Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) is the new Nike (NYSE:NKE). Deckers is posting record financial results and seeing its stock run higher due to the rising popularity of the company\u2019s Hoka running shoes. Deckers Teva sandals and Ugg boots are also posting strong sales. The result is that DECK stock is up 113% in the last 12 months, including a 55% increase this year.\n\nThe company recently knocked the cover off the ball with its Q1 earnings report, announcing EPS of $4.95, surpassing the consensus analyst estimate of $2.90. Revenue totaled $959.8 million, beating estimates of $885.04 million. Deckers Outdoor has posted double-digit revenue growth every quarter for the last four years and a more than threefold increase in its earnings per share. Sales of the company\u2019s Hoka running shoes rose 34% from a year earlier in the most recent quarter.\n\nDECK stock isn\u2019t cheap, trading at more than $1,000 per share. But there are rumors the stock may also split soon.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in NVDA, MSFT and DECK.

        "title": "Why Is CrowdStrike (CRWD) Stock Rocketing Higher Today",
        "content": "Why Is CrowdStrike (CRWD) Stock Rocketing Higher Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) jumped 9.6% in the morning session after the announcement that the company would join the S&P 500 index before the start of trading on Monday, June 24, 2024. The S&P 500 is a widely followed index that tracks the performance of the roughly 500 largest companies in the United States. Being included in the index means that CrowdStrike will likely be held by many index and mutual funds as well as ETFs, which could potentially drive up demand for the stock.\n\nWe note that while buying of the stock could increase, this development does not change the fundamentals of the company. Revenue growth, expense efficiency, and capital intensity of the business, for instance, are not impacted by index inclusion or exclusion, so this is more of a technical tailwind for the stock.\n\nIs now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nCrowdStrike's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 15 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago, when the stock gained 12.6% on the news that the company reported a \"beat and raise\" quarter. CrowdStrike narrowly exceeded analysts' revenue and annual recurring revenue (ARR) expectations, indicating continued customer investment in its products. Remaining performance obligations (RPO - leading revenue indicator) came in even stronger, accelerating to 42% y/y from 37% last quarter and ahead of analysts' expectations.\n\nLooking ahead, CrowdStrike raised its full-year revenue and EPS guidance, which beat Wall Street's projections. The outlook was impressive, given what management considered a \"challenging macro environment.\"\n\nZooming out, this was a great quarter, showing that the company is staying on target.\n\nCrowdStrike is up 53.8% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $6,548.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Investing in CrowdStrike (CRWD)? Don't Miss Assessing Its International Revenue Trends",
        "content": "Did you analyze how CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) fared in its international operations for the quarter ending April 2024? Given the widespread global presence of this cloud-based security company, scrutinizing the trends in international revenues becomes imperative to assess its financial strength and future growth possibilities.\n\nIn the current era of a tightly interconnected global economy, the proficiency of a company to penetrate international markets significantly influences its financial health and trajectory of growth. For investors, the key is to grasp how reliant a company is on overseas markets, as this provides insights into the durability of its earnings, its ability to exploit different economic cycles, and its overall growth capabilities.\n\nBeing present in international markets serves as a counterbalance to domestic economic challenges while offering chances to engage with more rapidly evolving economies. However, this kind of diversification introduces challenges like currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varying market trends.\n\nWhile analyzing CRWD's performance for the last quarter, we found some intriguing trends in revenues from its overseas segments that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\n\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $921.04 million, marking an increase of 33% from the year-ago quarter. We will next turn our attention to dissecting CRWD's international revenue to get a clearer picture of how significant its operations are outside its main base.\n\nUnveiling Trends in CRWD's International Revenues\n\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa generated $141.61 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 15.4% of the total. This represented a surprise of +2.38% compared to the $138.32 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Europe, Middle East, and Africa accounted for $132.31 million (15.7%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $104.55 million (15.1%) to the total revenue.\n\nOther International accounted for 6.1% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $55.94 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of +2.84%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $54.39 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Other International contributed $51.89 million (6.1%) and $40.98 million (5.9%) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nDuring the quarter, Asia Pacific contributed $93.46 million in revenue, making up 10.2% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $93.38 million, this meant a surprise of +0.09%. Looking back, Asia Pacific contributed $86.65 million, or 10.3%, in the previous quarter, and $72.22 million, or 10.4%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nStory continues\n\nProjected Revenues in Foreign Markets\n\nFor the current fiscal quarter, it is anticipated by Wall Street analysts that CrowdStrike will report a total revenue of $959.55 million, which reflects an increase of 31.2% from the same quarter in the previous year. The revenue contributions are expected to be 15.2% from Europe, Middle East, and Africa ($146.04 million), 6% from Other International ($57.48 million) and 10.2% from Asia Pacific ($98.03 million).\n\nFor the full year, the company is projected to achieve a total revenue of $4 billion, which signifies a rise of 30.8% from the last year. The share of this revenue from various regions is expected to be: Europe, Middle East, and Africa at 15.2% ($607.39 million), Other International at 6% ($239.1 million) and Asia Pacific at 10.2% ($407.69 million).\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCrowdStrike's reliance on international markets for revenues offers both opportunities and risks. Hence, keeping an eye on its international revenue trends could significantly help forecast the company's prospects.\n\nIn an era of growing international interdependencies and escalating geopolitical disputes, Wall Street analysts are vigilant in tracking these trends for businesses with a global reach, in order to refine their predictions of earnings. It should be noted, however, that a multitude of other elements, such as a company's domestic position, also play a significant role in shaping the earnings forecasts.\n\nEmphasizing a company's shifting earnings prospects is a key aspect of our approach at Zacks, especially since research has proven its substantial influence on a stock's price in the short run. This correlation is positively aligned, meaning that improved earnings projections tend to boost the stock's price.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool - the Zacks Rank - harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions and serves as an effective indicator of a stock's near-term price performance.\n\nCurrently, CrowdStrike holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), signifying its potential to underperform the overall market's performance in the forthcoming period. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nReviewing CrowdStrike's Recent Stock Price Trends\n\nOver the preceding four weeks, the stock's value has appreciated by 8.8%, against an upturn of 3.3% in the Zacks S&P 500 composite. In parallel, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which counts CrowdStrike among its entities, has appreciated by 6.4%. Over the past three months, the company's shares have seen an increase of 10.6% versus the S&P 500's 4.1% increase.

        "content": "Shares of KKR & Co. Inc. KKR, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD and GoDaddy Inc. GDDY gained 7.7%, 5.4% and 3.7%, respectively, in the after-market trading on Friday after the S&P Dow Jones Indices said that the firms would join the S&P 500 index.\r\n\r\nIn a press release, S&P Dow Jones Indices said that as part of the quarterly rebalancing, KKR, CRWD and GDDY will replace Robert Half Inc., Comerica and Illumina Inc. in the S&P 500 index prior to the start of trading on Jun 24.\r\n\r\nIn the last few years, the private investment business witnessed extraordinary growth. The inclusion of KKR in the S&P 500 index highlights growth of the industry.\r\n\r\nThe company has expanded across strategies from acquisitions and credit to infrastructure, real estate and insurance. Recently, it announced a plan to reach at least $1 trillion in assets under management in five years.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of KKR to the Index, its share price is expected to rise, further boosting investor confidence in the stock.\r\n\r\nThen again, the addition of CrowdStrike and GoDaddy to the S&P 500 index comes at a time when investors are moving toward software companies in order to capture growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nOwing to rising data breaches, CRWD has been benefiting from the soaring demand for cyber-security solutions. Its sustained focus on rolling out new products, acquisitions and partnerships is expected to continue to boost sales.\r\n\r\nGDDY has been benefiting from strong momentum across the Applications & Commerce business. Strength in Create & Grow solutions is aiding the Application & Commerce segment's top-line growth. Moreover, growth in bookings, primarily driven by substantial customer additions and price increases in various domains, has been a key catalyst for the company.\r\n\r\nNotably, U.S. firms that are highly liquid, with a market capitalization of at least $18 billion, and meet profitability, liquidity and share-float standards are the ones that can qualify for the S&P 500.\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 index is rebalanced each quarter. Mostly, additions and removals to the index happen during this time. However, companies can be added or removed from the index at other points of the year like after mergers and acquisitions.\r\n\r\nThe adjustments to the index are made by the S&P Dow Jones to account for shifts in market capitalizations and, sometimes, to adjust for the market\u2019s rotations.\r\n\r\nCurrently, KKR and GDDY carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). CRWD has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In a press release marking the change, S&P Global noted, \"The changes ensure each index is more representative of its market capitalization range.\"\n\nTo be eligible to join the S&P 500, a business must be a U.S.-based company with a market cap of at least $8.2 billion. Furthermore, at least 50% of its shares outstanding must be publicly traded, and the company must have been profitable in its most recent quarter and cumulatively profitable over the past four quarters.\n\nStocks often rally in response to being added to one of the major indexes, as institutional investors and funds that track these benchmarks must buy the stock in order to match the indexes' composition. That isn't to say anything about the underlying company has changed. Rather, this is an acknowledgment that the operational and financial excellence that helped the company meet the eligibility requirements likely will make it a good investment going forward.\n\nRoots in artificial intelligence (AI)\n\nThe increased focus on artificial intelligence (AI) over the past year or so has also shined a spotlight on CrowdStrike, as the company has long used machine learning and other forms of AI to counter the growing number of hacks, breaches, and other unauthorized system access.\n\nJust last week, the company continued its relentless trek higher. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 30) CrowdStrike generated revenue that grew 33% year over year to $921 million, while its adjusted earnings per share of $0.93 jumped 67%. The company continues to generate strong operational and free cash flow and add customers.\n\nFor those reasons and more, CrowdStrike stock is a buy.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "S&P Dow Jones Indices announced on Friday that CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) will join the S&P 500 index on June 21, following the stock's recent GAAP profitability.\n\nThe move, which comes as part of S&P 500\u2019s quarterly rebalancing, reflects CRWD's improved fundamentals, driven by \u201cincreased focus on balancing growth and operating efficiency over the past few years,\u201d JPMorgan analysts said in a note.\n\n\u201cWhile we view the inclusion in the index as a positive, we prefer to view the milestone as a reflection of improving quality over the long term, rather than a long-term catalyst,\u201d they added.\n\nAnalysts believe that despite macro and other factors, CRWD is expected to trade up on the news of its inclusion in the S&P 500 index. However, they caution that the impact on CRWD stock will likely be short-lived.\n\n\u201cAccording to our Global Quantitative and Derivatives Strategy team, upon announcement of inclusion in the S&P 500 index, stocks could gain approximately 5.6% immediately (before the next day open),\u201d the team wrote.\n\n\u201cHowever, most of the price increase tends to revert by the actual inclusion date which is the date when index tracking funds will purchase the addition.\u201d\n\nCRWD shares were up 5.2% in premarket trading Monday, at the time of writing.\n\nAlongside CrowdStrike, private-equity giant KKR&Co (NYSE:KKR). and web host GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) will also join the S&P 500 index at market open on June 24.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEarnings call: Elekta reports mixed results, eyes future growth\n\nEarnings call: Saputo Inc. reports strong FY2024 financials, plans CEO transition\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 25 Fastest Growing Cybersecurity Companies in the World that you can check for free.\n\nThe Rising Costs and Expanding Market of Global Cybersecurity\n\nFortune Business Insights says that the global cybersecurity market size was valued at $172.32 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $424.97 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 13.8% during the forecast period. The potential impact of cybercrime is significant, with damages estimated to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, a 300% increase from 2015, according to McKinsey.\n\nThe US is a major player in the global cybersecurity market, with the North American region accounting for a market value of $67.77 billion in 2022 and a projected CAGR of 12.7% from 2023 to 2030. According to Gartner, worldwide security spending in the US is expected to reach $188.1 billion in 2023 and $288.5 billion by 2027.\n\nMalicious actions have increased along with the expansion of the world's cyber infrastructure, resulting in substantial costs for damage and prevention. Cybersecurity Ventures stated that victims of cybercrime lost $6 trillion in 2021, and that figure is expected to rise to $10.5 trillion by 2025, at a rate of 15% per year. In comparison, the GDP of Japan is $4.4 trillion. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett believes that cyberattacks are the largest issue facing humanity and highlights the dire consequences of these escalating expenses.\n\nCompanies and organizations invested $150 billion in cybersecurity in 2021, according to McKinsey. The threat picture is, nevertheless, changing quickly. 40% of malware and 80% of threat groups were brand-new in 2021, according to a survey of 4,000 businesses. Additionally, McKinsey points out that the $150 billion invested is a very tiny portion of the cybersecurity total addressable market (TAM). The market can grow to $1.5 trillion even at only ten percent market penetration.\n\nMajor Players in the Cybersecurity Industry\n\nMajor players in the cybersecurity industry include CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), Fortinet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT), and Palo Alto, among others. These companies have been largely contributing to the cybersecurity market in various ways. For Example, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s flagship product, the CrowdStrike Falcon platform, is a cornerstone of its cybersecurity offerings. This platform provides comprehensive protection for endpoints, cloud workloads, identities, and data. The company has been named a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms for four consecutive years and has received high scores in the Vision and Innovation criteria. CrowdStrike partners with this veteran-led nonprofit organization to support the recovery and rehabilitation of medically retiring or retired military service members through motorsport activities. This partnership includes a multi-year donation of $400,000 and various volunteer and mentorship opportunities for CrowdStrike employees. Financially, in Q1 2024, the company\u2019s total Revenue was $692.6 million which is a 42% increase compared to $487.8 million in Q1 2023 and their subscription revenue was $651.2 million which is also a 42% increase compared to $459.8 million in Q1 2023. Based on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)'s Q1 2024 report, their annual recurring revenue grew 42% year-over-year to $2.73 billion in the same period, with $174.2 million in net new ARR added in the quarter. urt Podbere, the CFO of the company said\n\nStory continues\n\n\"CrowdStrike delivered an exceptional start to the fiscal year, driven by strong execution and increased platform adoption as customers prioritize their cybersecurity budgets around consolidation on the Falcon platform, driving bigger deals and increased wallet share\"\n\nSimilarly, Fortinet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) is also one of the biggest cybersecurity companies in the world. The company is a member of the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), established by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Through this collaboration, Fortinet shares threat intelligence and best practices to strengthen the United States' security posture. Fortinet also participates in strategic alliances, such as the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA), to share threat intelligence and enhance the overall security posture of the industry. Financially, in Q1 2024, Fortinet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) reported total revenues of $1.35 billion which is a 7% increase year-over-year and their service revenue stood at $944 million, a 24% increase year-over-year. Their product revenue stood at $408.9 million which is an 18% decrease year-over-year. They reported a GAAP operating margin of 23.7% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 28.5%. This is what Keith Jensen, CFO of Fortinet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) said about Fortinet\u2019s Q1 earnings:\n\n\u201cTotal billings declined 6%, primarily due to the difficult year-over-year comparison caused by backlog contribution in the prior year's first quarter. However, unified SASE and SecOps had outstanding growth, and existing customers delivered over 90% of SecOps and unified SASE billing\u201d\n\nHe also added:\n\n\u201cWe saw slight weakness in Europe, which nudged the billings towards the lower end of the guidance range, but it wasn't a significant deviation. The overall annual guidance remains consistent with our expectations, supported by a healthy pipeline and operational improvements made over the last 6-9 months.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our methodology, we ranked the 25 fastest-growing cybersecurity companies in the world based on their YoY revenue growth rate from 2022-23. We have also included some companies that aren't pure-play but are critical to the cybersecurity industry.\n\nThe Fastest Growing Cybersecurity Companies in the World\n\n1. SentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S)\n\nYoY Growth: 47.13%\n\nSentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S) tops the list for being the fastest-growing cybersecurity company in the world. In Q1 2024 their revenue increased 70% year-over-year to $133.4 million and annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) grew 75% year-over-year to $564 million.

        "content": "Shares of CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) surged after the cybersecurity company reported strong fiscal first-quarter earnings.

It had previously guided for adjusted EPS of between $0.89 to $0.90.\n\nOperating cash flow came in at $383.2 million, while free cash flow was $322.5 million. The company ended the quarter with nearly $3 billion in net cash and short-term investments.\n\nThe company continues to strike deals that include more of its cybersecurity modules. Over 65% of CrowdStrike's customers have five or more modules, while 28% have seven or more. Its number of deals with eight or more modules, meanwhile, surged by 95%. It said the number of deals that included its Cloud, Identity, or Falcon next-gen SIEM modules more than doubled year over year.\n\nCrowdStrike was very bullish on its Falcon and Falcon Flex programs, which it said have strong win rates and are driving larger platform deal sizes. Falcon is an artificial intelligence (AI)-native platform console that lets its 28 modules work seamlessly together. Its Flex program offers a flexible licensing agreement that lets prenegotiated commitments be drawn down over time, and even allows companies to switch out modules as their needs change.\n\nLooking ahead, CrowdStrike forecast Q2 revenue to come in a range of $958.3 million to $961.2 million, with adjusted EPS of between $0.98 to $0.99. For its full fiscal year, it is looking for revenue to be between $3.98 billion to $4.01 billion and EPS of between $3.93 to $4.03. That is up from prior guidance calling for revenue between $3.92 billion and $3.99 billion and adjusted EPS of between $3.77 to $3.97.\n\nOverall, this was a great quarterly report from CrowdStrike that really separated it from its cybersecurity peers. In fact, on its earnings conference call, Wells Fargo analyst Andrew Nowinski immediately contrasted the company's quarter versus its rivals, pointing out that \"every single one of ... [its] peers has put up pretty mediocre results this quarter.\"\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs it too late to buy the stock?\n\nCrowdStrike has proven to be best of breed in the world of cybersecurity, and not surprisingly, it trades at a premium valuation as a result.\n\nTrading at a nearly 21 times forward price-to-sales (P/S) multiple, the stock is by far one of the priciest cybersecurity stocks out there. CRWD PS Ratio (Forward) Chart CRWD PS Ratio Chart\n\nNow the stock is trading at a lower valuation than it has commanded at points in the past, but its growth has also slowed down. Its revenue growth has gone from over 125% in 2018 to around 81% in 2021 to 54% in 2023 down to the low-to-mid-30% range currently. With slower revenue growth should come a lower multiple.\n\nWhile CrowdStrike has proven to be among the best cybersecurity companies out there, valuation does matter. As such, I prefer to wait on the sidelines and would only be a buyer on a price dip at these valuation levels.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Did Investors Wait Too Long to Buy CrowdStrike Stock?",
        "content": "CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) surged 12% higher following its earnings release for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 30, 2024) and has held steady in subsequent trading sessions. The company continues to grow at a rapid clip, and it is now within 10% of its all-time intraday high of $365 per share.\n\nUnfortunately, this situation strongly indicates that new investors might have bought into the stock too late. Hence, prospective buyers will have to ponder whether they can still profit from CrowdStrike or whether they should look elsewhere for opportunities.\n\nThe state of CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike has become one of the leading cybersecurity stocks. This is crucial since the IT industry's migration to the cloud is not possible without cybersecurity products designed specifically for devices that could be anywhere at any time.\n\nFortune Business Insights estimated the size of the global cybersecurity market at $132 billion in 2023 and believes it will grow to $425 billion by 2030, giving it a compound annual growth rate of 14%.\n\nCrowdStrike has captured its share of this market by specializing in end point security. Its Falcon security suite aims to make sure the entry points of devices such as smartphones, laptops, and servers are well protected whatever their locations.\n\nIt also sells modules offering other security products, an increasingly important benefit as more companies seek to deal with only one online security company.\n\nThis factor seems to help CrowdStrike in a highly competitive environment. Around 65% of the company's customers subscribe to at least five modules, and deals involving eight or more modules rose 95% over the previous year.\n\nHow it held up financially\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, CrowdStrike reported revenue of $921 million, a 33% increase from year-ago levels. This was only slightly less than the 36% yearly revenue increase in fiscal 2024.\n\nOperating expenses grew at a slightly slower pace, leading to $7 million in operating income. Still, thanks to $46 million in interest income and $8 million from other sources, CrowdStrike earned $43 million in net income after interest expenses and taxes. This was up from $491,000 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nManagement forecasts between $958 million and $961 million in revenue in the fiscal second quarter. This would mean a 31% yearly increase, a slightly slower but still robust rate. The modest slowing has not deterred investors if the 120% increase in the stock price over the last year is any indication.\n\nUnfortunately for prospective buyers, this increase has taken the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio to 26. Although that is below the five-year average multiple of 30, that far exceeds the sales multiples of competitors such as Zscaler, Okta, and Palo Alto Networks.\n\nStory continues CRWD PS Ratio Chart\n\nThus, even though CrowdStrike has become a profitable company, its valuation might price it for perfection, making it a riskier stock to buy at today's prices.\n\nAm I too late?\n\nFor a long-term investor, the company's growth story should continue for years to come.\n\nUnfortunately, its valuation appears elevated by nearly any measure, which calls for buyers to turn cautious. Those who buy now face a risk of sentiment turning negative, which could take the stock down for months or possibly years.\n\nHence, if investors buy now, they should make small purchases only, perhaps by taking a dollar-cost averaging approach. Such a move allows them to profit from this potentially lucrative opportunity while positioning themselves to buy more stock should CrowdStrike experience a pullback.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Better Cybersecurity Stock: CrowdStrike vs. Zscaler",
        "content": "CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) and Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS) both recently posted strong quarterly reports that exceeded analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines. Both cybersecurity stocks rallied after those earnings beats.\n\nBut over the past 12 months, CrowdStrike's stock has soared more than 120%, while Zscaler's shares rose by less 20%. Let's see why the bulls were more drawn to CrowdStrike -- and whether that trend will continue for the foreseeable future. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe similarities and differences\n\nCrowdStrike and Zscaler are both cloud-native cybersecurity specialists that don't install any on-site appliances. That lightweight approach is cheaper, easier to scale, and doesn't require any on-site maintenance services. Both companies also lock their clients into sticky subscription plans.\n\nCrowdStrike's Falcon platform provides a broad range of endpoint security services that mainly counter external threats. Zscaler develops \"zero-trust\" services that treat everyone, including a company's top executives, as potential threats.\n\nCrowdStrike and Zscaler aren't direct competitors, but they have overlapping interests. CrowdStrike now offers its own zero-trust services, while Zscaler has been expanding its ecosystem with more security tools. Both companies have consistently kept their adjusted gross margin around 80%, so they still have plenty of pricing power in their respective markets.\n\nThe duo has also grown rapidly since their IPOs. CrowdStrike went public in 2019, and its revenue increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 65% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this January). Zscaler went public in 2018, and its revenue rose at a CAGR of 53% from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last July).\n\nThe pair faces similar challenges\n\nCybersecurity companies are resistant to macro headwinds, since most businesses won't shut down their digital defenses to save a few dollars. But it can still become tougher to lock new customers into bigger and longer-term contracts.\n\nThat's why CrowdStrike and Zscaler both grappled with slower growth over the past year. CrowdStrike expects its revenue to rise 28%-31% in fiscal 2025. Zscaler expects a 32% increase in revenue in fiscal 2024, while analysts anticipate a 23% boost in fiscal 2025. CrowdStrike's year-over-year revenue growth notably stabilized over the past two quarters, which implies it's passed its cyclical trough. Zscaler's revenue is still decelerating, and it expects its slowdown to deepen in its current quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut CrowdStrike has a few advantages versus Zscaler\n\nCrowdStrike and Zscaler might initially seem similar, but the profits tell a different story. CrowdStrike has stayed profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis for five consecutive quarters, but analysts don't expect Zscaler to generate an annual profit on the same basis until fiscal 2026.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, analysts expect CrowdStrike's EPS to rise 30% in fiscal 2025. They expect Zscaler's non-GAAP EPS to soar 64% in fiscal 2024 but only climb 13% in fiscal 2025 as it laps some cloud-related cost benefits and ramps up its investments again.\n\nCrowdStrike also maintains higher free cash flow (FCF) margins than Zscaler. In their latest quarters, CrowdStrike's FCF margin rose 2 percentage points year over year to 35%, while Zscaler's FCF margin grew 4 percentage points to 22%.\n\nCrowdStrike's insiders also seem more optimistic than Zscaler's. Over the past 12 months, CrowdStrike's insiders only sold about 28% more shares than they bought, while Zscaler's insiders sold nearly 10 times as many shares as they bought.\n\nNeither of these stocks is a bargain\n\nBoth of these stocks still sport premium valuations. CrowdStrike trades at 87 times its forward adjusted EPS, while Zscaler has a lower forward multiple of 52. Zscaler might seem cheaper, but it deserves its lower valuation because its revenue growth is less impressive, it isn't profitable yet, and it has a narrower moat. CrowdStrike's valuations are getting a bit frothy after its yearlong rally, but I believe it will continue to outperform Zscaler as long as it keeps exceeding Wall Street's estimates.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Wall Street Is Very Bullish on Another Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock",
        "content": "Nvidia stock has soared 715% since the beginning of 2023, making it very hard to ignore. The company has added $2.5 trillion to its valuation in that time, thanks entirely to red-hot demand for its data center chips designed for processing artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.\n\nBut the AI industry is expanding quickly, and investors have a growing number of opportunities to consider. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), for example, is a leader in AI-based cybersecurity, and its products have become an essential part of the software stack for businesses of all sizes.\n\nNvidia bears are a rare breed on Wall Street, but so are CrowdStrike bears right now. Here's why it could be a great addition to any stock portfolio -- even one that already includes Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCrowdStrike's strategy is resonating with customers\n\nThe enterprise cybersecurity industry has a history of fragmentation. Different vendors often specialized in different areas -- some excelled at cloud security, while others developed best-in-class identity security -- so businesses had to piece products together from multiple providers. However, the industry is shifting, and cybersecurity vendors who can cover all bases with one platform are winning big.\n\nThat has been CrowdStrike's strategy from the start. Its Falcon platform is a lightweight solution with 28 modules available to customers that cover cloud security, identity security, endpoint protection, exposure management, and more.\n\nDuring the fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 30), CrowdStrike said 65% of its customers were using five or more modules. Plus, the number of customers who adopted eight modules soared by a whopping 95% compared to the year-ago period. It's a clear sign organizations are rushing to consolidate their cybersecurity needs onto one platform.\n\nIt's no surprise, considering a recent study by International Data Corporation (and sponsored by CrowdStrike) found that companies save $6 for every $1 they invest in the company's platform. Additionally, CrowdStrike claims it can make security teams twice as effective with incident investigations concluding 66% faster than with a fragmented cybersecurity stack.\n\nAI is the secret sauce behind CrowdStrike's speed and effectiveness. Automation is key to dealing with modern-day threats, which continue to grow in both frequency and sophistication. Data is the lifeblood of AI, and CrowdStrike's models are trained on more than 2 trillion security events each day, which means they become faster and more accurate over time.\n\nCrowdStrike beat revenue and earnings expectations in Q1\n\nCrowdStrike generated $921 million in revenue during the fiscal first quarter, up 33% year over year and also comfortably above management's forecast of $904 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the company's bottom-line results were even more impressive. It delivered its fifth-consecutive quarter of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profitability with $42.8 million in net income. This came on the back of careful cost management with operating expenses rising only 27% year over year, allowing more money to flow to the bottom line.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which strips out one-off and noncash expenses like stock-based compensation, CrowdStrike delivered $231.7 million in net income, which was a whopping 70% increase from the year-ago period. It translated to $0.93 in non-GAAP earnings per share, which was also better than management's guidance of $0.90.\n\nSimply put, CrowdStrike has converted its leadership position in AI and its soaring revenue growth into an increasingly profitable business, which is something many of its peers have been unable to achieve so far.\n\nWall Street is very bullish on CrowdStrike stock\n\nThe Wall Street Journal tracks 49 analysts covering CrowdStrike stock, and 38 (78%) of them have given it the highest-possible buy rating. A further seven are in the overweight (bullish) camp, and the remaining four recommend holding. No analysts recommend selling.\n\nTheir average price target (which typically covers the next 12 to 18 months) for CrowdStrike stock is $397.68, which implies upside of 17% from where it trades as of this writing. However, the stock could crush the Street's estimate long term.\n\nCrowdStrike ended Q1 with $3.6 billion in annual recurring revenue, but it believes it can nearly triple that figure over the next five to seven years to reach $10 billion. Customers' preference for a unified platform will be instrumental to hitting that milestone, and CrowdStrike is already proving it can save them money while delivering the most advanced AI-powered protection.\n\nCrowdStrike is a best-in-class cybersecurity provider, and it can be a best-in-class cybersecurity and AI stock for any portfolio.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Profiting from the Crowd: 3 Stocks Set to Surge on Retail Investor Enthusiasm",
        "content": "Many people are looking for stocks to buy, driven by just one thing: fear. Whether it is the fear of losing it all or the fear of missing out (FOMO), investors tend to run in packs. That is why it pays to be contrarian. Zig when the market zags, or as Warren Buffett says, be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.\n\nDoing the opposite of what everyone else is doing is how you can handsomely profit from the \u201cwisdom\u201d of crowds.\n\nSo where are we now? The Chicago Board of Options (CBOE) oversees the Volatility Index, commonly called the VIX. It measures the volatility investors expect in the stock market. The lower the index, the more bullish investors are. The higher, the more fearful they tend to be.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRight now, the VIX sits right around 13, which suggests bullishness (between 0 and 15 is a bullish sentiment). Arguably, direction is more important than location. Which way the index is heading can reveal more about investor mindset than where it is at any given moment. Today, the VIX is falling.\n\nIn mid-April, the index was just below 20, which generally means normal market conditions. However, just as the pandemic struck in March 2020, the VIX soared at an all-time high 82.69.\n\nAccording to the VIX, retail investor enthusiasm remains upbeat today. Other indices, such as the CNN Business Fear and Greed Index, suggest fear is driving the market to new highs.\n\nThis seems to be two sides of the same coin. As the stock market goes higher, FOMO is kicking in. Investors can use that to their advantage. Below are three stocks to buy that are poised to surge from the crowd wanting in.\n\nStocks to Buy: Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocks\n\nSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.com\n\nConsidering Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX) has already tripled in value in 2024, getting in now might seem like I\u2019m encouraging investors to do what I just warned about\u2014getting onboard late after all the profits were made. However, the biotech stock still has more gas left in the engine to power further gains.\n\nMuch of its growth is already related to its weight-loss therapy in clinical trials. VK2735 reported positive Phase 2 trial results earlier this year, and because it is an oral treatment rather than an injection like Ozempic from Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) or Zepbound from Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), the market opportunity is much larger.\n\nIf that was all Viking had going for it, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. However, the biotech just reported positive results from its \u201cbest-in-class\u201d therapy, VK2809, for liver disease. The treatment seems to stop the additional fibrosis formation due to the fatty tissue buildup in the liver. Left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis. Viking previously reported that VK2809 led to significant reductions in liver fatty tissue.\n\nStory continues\n\nViking Therapeutics stock is down 43% from its 52-week high. Yet, with even more therapies in its portfolio and positive developments on its lead candidates, VKTX stock looks ready to surge.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s not quite as exciting as the biotech world, but McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) recent introduction of a new $5 value meal could be just as important to the fast-food joint. Consumers have been walloped by a lack of job growth, anemic wage gains, and high inflation and interest rates. They have reeled in spending on most goods beyond necessities.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s used to be a place families could go to get a cheap, tasty meal quickly, but the burger shop\u2019s lack of value in its meal selection kept many away. The restaurant chain warned earlier this year that growth would moderate in 2024, and in its first-quarter earnings report, we saw that happen. Global comparable sales fell for the fourth consecutive quarter, and it missed profit projections for the first time in two years.\n\nThat\u2019s why the new value meal offering is important. This shows that McDonald\u2019s again focuses on its core customers and their need for low-cost food options. That could spark a turnaround in its stock, currently down 12% year-to-date. Shares are near their 52-week low and is one of the best stocks to buy before they begin a new run higher.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Viking Therapeutics, buying cybersecurity leader Crowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) now is like closing the barn door after the horse ran off. The stock just reported earnings that have the stock popping 12% on the news. And that\u2019s after shares were already up 28% this year and had doubled over the past 12 months.\n\nYes, maybe it would have been better to buy the stock yesterday or last year when I identified Crowdstrike as a \u201cstrong buy\u201d in cybersecurity, but there is plenty of profit opportunity left. The threat of hackers and cybercrime has never been bigger. LexisNexis Risk Solutions says \u201chuman-initiated digital attacks\u201d are up 19% globally from last year.\n\nThat explains why Crowdstrike\u2019s revenue jumped 33% year-over-year while it produced 17 cents per share in profits this quarter versus break-even last year. Net new average recurring revenue also grew\u00a022% for the year-ago period to $212 million, with a record free cash flow of $322 million.\n\nCrowdstrike\u2019s business remains hot, and there seems to be no let-up in how high it can soar. Definitely one of the best stocks to buy!\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Where Will CrowdStrike Stock Be in 1 Year?",
        "content": "CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) posted its latest earnings report on Tuesday, June 4. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended on April 30, the cybersecurity company's revenue rose 33% year over year to $921 million and exceeded analysts' estimates by $16 million. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew 63% and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.04.\n\nCrowdStrike followed up its earnings beat by lifting its full-year revenue and earnings outlook. Its stock rallied in response to that glowing report, but does it still have room to run after more than doubling over the past 12 months? Let's review its growth trajectory and valuations to see where it might be headed in a year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAnother quarter of stabilizing growth\n\nCrowdStrike stands out in the crowded cybersecurity market because it only provides its endpoint security tools as cloud-based services instead of on-site appliances. That approach is cheaper, doesn't require on-site maintenance, and is easier to scale as an organization expands. It also locks its clients into sticky cloud-based subscriptions.\n\nCrowdStrike's first mover's advantage in the cloud-native space enabled it to disrupt many older cybersecurity companies. That's why its revenue grew at a staggering compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 65% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 (which ended in January 2024). But over the past year, its growth cooled off as the macro headwinds made it harder to gain new customers and cross-sell additional cloud-based modules.\n\nIts revenue still increased 36% in fiscal 2024, but its growth in ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) decelerated as its net new ARR (the amount of ARR from new customers) declined in the first half of the year. Those two consecutive quarters of declining net new ARR spooked the bulls, but that closely watched metric accelerated again in the second half of the year. As a result, the company's revenue growth broadly stabilized over the past two quarters.\n\nMetric Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Ending ARR growth (YOY) 42% 37% 35% 34% 33% Net new ARR growth (YOY) (8%) (10%) 13% 27% 22% Revenue growth (YOY) 42% 37% 35% 33% 33%\n\nData source: CrowdStrike. YOY = Year-over-year.\n\nCrowdStrike now expects its revenue to rise 30% to 31% for the full year, compared to its previous outlook for 28% to 31% growth. It attributed that robust growth to its market share gains, new government contracts, and the expansion of its platform with more generative AI features. At the end of the first quarter, 44% of its customers had adopted at least six of its modules, up from 43% in the fourth quarter and 40% in the prior-year quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike continues to grow at a healthy clip while many of its peers -- including Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) -- still struggle to gain new customers in this challenging environment. During the first-quarter conference call, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz took a jab at Palo Alto Networks' recent platformization strategy (which is currently driven by free trials and deferred revenue deals) -- by saying that \"when a platform delivers real value, you don't have to give it away.\"\n\nIts margins are still expanding\n\nIn the first quarter, CrowdStrike's adjusted subscription gross margin held steady year over year at 80%, its adjusted operating margin expanded five percentage points to 22%, and it stayed firmly profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis for the fifth consecutive quarter as it reined in its stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nThose expanding margins indicate CrowdStrike still has plenty of pricing power and that economies of scale are kicking in as it gains more customers. It expects its free cash flow (FCF) margin to rise from 31% in fiscal 2024 to 31%-33% in fiscal 2025.\n\nOn the bottom line, it expects its adjusted EPS to increase 27% to 30% for the full year. That's also higher than its previous outlook for 22% to 28% growth.\n\nBut can CrowdStrike maintain its premium valuation?\n\nCrowdStrike's growth rates are impressive, but its stock isn't cheap. At $326 per share, it trades at 82 times the midpoint of its projected earnings for fiscal 2025. Its enterprise value of $71 billion is roughly 18 times this year's estimated sales.\n\nBy comparison, Palo Alto Networks -- which is growing slower but has a more broadly diversified ecosystem -- trades at 46 times forward earnings and 12 times this year's sales. In other words, CrowdStrike will need to keep hitting home runs over the next few quarters to drive its stock even higher in this volatile market.\n\nWhere will CrowdStrike's stock be in a year?\n\nCrowdStrike is clearly disrupting legacy cybersecurity companies with its cloud-native services, it's squeezing more revenue from its customers, and its margins are rising. I don't think its stock will double again over the next 12 months, but I believe it should gradually climb higher as it continues to beat Wall Street's expectations. It should also have plenty of room to run over the long term as the cloud-native cybersecurity market expands.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Cash Flow Kings: 7 Stocks Set to Deliver Massive Value to Shareholders",
        "content": "A commonly used method to value stocks is discounted cash flow analysis. The basic idea is to estimate the present value of future cash flow from the business. While revenue growth is important, the bottom line is the cash flow potential that the business holds. Investors should look for cash-flow stocks that represent companies with robust free cash flow and the ability to increase cash flow on a sustained basis.\n\nAn important point to note is that blue-chip companies generally have robust cash flow. On the other hand, growth companies are focused on aggressive investments and cash flow is relatively low. However, if an investor can correctly identify a future cash-flow machine, returns from the stock can be multi-fold.\n\nI have discussed a mix of blue-chip and emerging ideas from the perspective of cash flow potential from the business. I must add that healthy cash flow would also imply robust dividends and sustained value creation through share repurchase.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese are seven cash-flow stocks worth your attention now.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nThat Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a valuation of almost $3 trillion is not a euphoria or a bubble. The valuation is a function of innovation and the cash flow potential. AAPL stock has a low dividend yield of 0.5%. However, I expect robust dividend growth in the next five years.\n\nApple reported operating cash flow of $62.5 billion for the first half of 2024, implying an annualized operating cash flow potential of $125 billion. Further, the technology company has a cash buffer of $160 billion.\n\nTherefore, there is ample flexibility for dividends, share repurchases, and investment in innovation-driven growth. For the first half of 2024, the products business witnessed some contraction. However, the services segment, which includes the App Store, offset that weakness.\n\nEven in the product segment, the wearable, home, and accessories businesses are likely to gain growth traction in global markets. Recently, the company unveiled a new AI-focused chip in its iPad Pro. With AI-powered enhancement in devices, I expect the products segment to deliver healthy growth in the coming quarters. Therefore, as the business grows, cash flows will continue to swell.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another technology stock that looks attractively valued, and the business is a cash flow machine. GOOG stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.5x, which is attractive considering the impending growth backed by AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Q1 2024, Alphabet reported revenue growth of 15% on a year-on-year basis to $80.5 billion. It\u2019s worth noting that the Google Cloud business growth was 28% to $9.6 billion. Further, the technology giant reported operating cash flow of $23.5 billion for the quarter. The annualized operating cash flow potential is almost $100 billion.\n\nThis provides Alphabet with the flexibility to invest in AI-driven growth. At the same time, I expect a robust upside in dividends in the coming years. Coming back to AI, Alphabet is just getting started on that front. Last month, the company launched a beefed-up AI search and chatbot. Alphabet believes that it\u2019s well-positioned for the \u201cnext wave of AI innovation.\u201d I, therefore, expect healthy growth to be sustained coupled with a cash flow upside.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Lockheed Martin (LMT) M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).3D illustration.\n\nSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobal defense expenditures surged to $2.44 trillion in 2023 and there is no doubt that spending will continue to swell. Defense stocks are likely to benefit on the back of a robust order intake. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is among the undervalued defense stocks to buy at a forward P/E of 17.9x. The defense stock also offers a healthy dividend yield of 2.7%.\n\nAs of the first quarter, Lockheed Martin reported an order backlog of $159 billion. This provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility. For 2024, the company guided for free cash flow of $6.2 billion (mid-range). This provides ample flexibility for dividend growth and continued share repurchases.\n\nIt\u2019s also likely that sales growth will accelerate in the coming years and will have a positive impact on cash flows. There are two reasons to expect healthy sales growth. First, Lockheed increasingly pursued deals outside the U.S. with its allies. The geographic expansion will benefit the defense major.\n\nFurther, Lockheed is focused on next-generation defense technology, including hypersonic and next-generation interceptors. Its aggressive investment in research and development is likely to be a growth catalyst.\n\nChevron (CVX)\n\nSource: JL IMAGES / Shutterstock.com\n\nChevron (NYSE:CVX) is an undervalued blue-chip stock from the oil and gas industry. In the last 12 months, CVX stock remained sideways with oil struggling to trend higher on the back of macroeconomic headwinds. I see the sideways move as a good opportunity to accumulate.\n\nWith multiple interest rate cuts likely in the next 12 to 18 months, I am bullish on oil. Chevron has an investment-grade balance sheet and high-quality assets with an attractive break-even point.\n\nChevron reported operating cash flow of $35.6 billion for 2023 and $6.8 billion in the first quarter of 2024. If oil trends higher, it\u2019s likely that cash flow will be in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion for the year.\n\nCash flows will swell further with the likely completion of the acquisition of Hess (NYSE:HES). Therefore, even with aggressive capital investment plans, there will be ample flexibility for dividend growth and share repurchase.\n\nCostco Wholesale (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is possibly the best pick among retail stocks considering the company\u2019s growth trajectory. While a forward P/E of 51x looks slightly stretched, COST stock has always commanded a valuation premium as compared to peers. I would look at corrections to accumulate this retail behemoth.\n\nFor the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, Costco reported sales growth of 9.1% on a year-on-year basis to $57.39 billion. Comparable store sales growth was also healthy at 6.6%. With rate cuts impending, I expect consumption expenditures to accelerate, and Costco will benefit.\n\nFor the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the company reported operating cash flow of $8.3 billion. Cash flows have continued to swell, and I remain bullish, considering the top-line growth and continued upside in membership revenue.\n\nAs of Q1 2023, Costco had two warehouses in China. In the last quarter, the number of warehouses increased to seven. International expansion is likely to be another catalyst for growth and cash flow upside.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity stocks have been in the limelight considering the big addressable market. CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an emerging cash-flow business that deserves a place in the portfolio. CRWD stock surged by 122% in the last 12 months. There was an intermediate correction, but the reversal was swift on the back of strong Q1 results.\n\nFor the first quarter, CrowdStrike reported stellar revenue growth of 33% on a year-on-year basis to $921 million. For the same period, CrowdStrike generated operating cash flow of $383 million and ended the quarter with a cash buffer of $3.7 billion. With annual operating cash flow visibility of almost $1.6 billion, CrowdStrike is an emerging cash-flow star.\n\nThe cybersecurity company reported annual recurring revenue of $3.65 billion as of April. Over the next five to seven years, CrowdStrike is targeting an annual recurring revenue of $10 billion. This provides an indication of the headroom for upside in revenue and cash flows. It\u2019s, therefore, not surprising that CRWD stock has remained in a sharp uptrend.\n\nNewmont Corporation (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock\n\nMultiple factors globally are likely to ensure that gold remains in an uptrend. Some important reasons include geopolitical tensions, inflation, and the prospects of expansionary policies. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is a blue-chip gold mining company worth holding for healthy dividends and capital gains.\n\nAs of 2023, Newmont reported 128 million ounces of gold reserves and 155 million ounces in resources. The gold miner has a leading portfolio of 10 Tier 1 assets. A strong asset base ensures a steady production upside beyond the current decade.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Newmont has an investment-grade balance sheet. As of Q1 2024, the company reported a liquidity buffer of $7 billion. Last year, Newmont reported operating cash flow of $2.7 billion. With gold trending higher, it\u2019s likely that operating cash flow will be more than $3.5 billion. This provides ample flexibility for dividend growth. At the same time, capital investments will remain aggressive backed by a strong balance sheet.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Does CrowdStrike's (CRWD) Strong Portfolio Make the Stock a Buy?",
        "content": "CrowdStrike CRWD shares have gained 128.1% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's growth of 39.2%. The uptick can be attributed to CrowdStrike\u2019s impressive financial performance in recent quarters, driven by an expanding cybersecurity market, strong partner base, innovative product developments and the expanding cybersecurity market.\n\nAccording to a Markets and Markets report, the cybersecurity space in which CrowdStrike operates is projected to grow at 9.4% from 2023 to 2028. There is a growing gap in the cybersecurity market due to the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber crimes.\n\nCrowdStrike is capitalizing on this opportunity by rolling out innovative features for its Falcon platform that are keeping it ahead of its competitors.\n\nCrowdStrike Price and Consensus CrowdStrike Price and Consensus\n\nCrowdStrike price-consensus-chart | CrowdStrike Quote\n\nSo far in 2024, CRWD has been able to upgrade its Falcon platform to integrate data from 500-plus independent software vendors, including Amazon Web Services, Cloudflare NET, Cribl, ExtraHop, Okta, Rubrik and Zscaler.\n\nCrowdStrike also integrated its Application Security Posture Management into its Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform to mitigate code-to-cloud security breaches. The company also provided its customers with the perk of free 10 gigabytes of third-party data ingestion per day on its Falcon Next-Gen SIEM. With all these features, CrowdStrike is focusing on enriching its customer experience.\n\nCRWD recently introduced a program, Falcon for Insurability. It enables insurers to offer cyber insurance at preferred rates. The program reduces underwriting risk for CrowdStrike\u2019s insurer partners as they are leveraging the reliable Falcon platform. This benefits both parties and could potentially lead to increased subscriptions due to this advantage.\n\nCrowdStrike Enhances its Products Through Partnerships\n\nCrowdStrike has launched the Falcon for Insurability program in partnership with leading insurers such as Ascot Group, AXA XL, Beazley Insurance, Berkley Cyber Risk Solutions, Coalition and Resilience. This marks one of CrowdStrike's largest partnerships this year, complementing numerous other collaborations, including the ones with NVIDIA NVDA and Cloudflare.\n\nRecently, CrowdStrike partnered with Cloudflare to integrate Cloudflare One Zero Trust protection and CrowdStrike Falcon Next-Gen SIEM to ensure security from devices to network, improve the Security Operations Center, mitigate large-scale breaches and simplify the task of joint channel partners.\n\nStory continues\n\nCRWD also merged its Falcon platform data with NVIDIA's GPU-optimized AI pipelines and NVIDIA NIM microservices enabling their shared customers to seamlessly create custom and secure generative AI models.\n\nCrowdStrike also benefited from the windfall of customers shifting to its Falcon platform when it expanded its collaboration with eSentire. eSentire had a significant portion of its customer base using Broadcom AVGO Carbon Black, and it is migrating its customers from there to the Falcon platform.\n\nSince Carbon Black went public, it has been through acquisitions by VMware and then Broadcom. After VMware\u2019s acquisition by Broadcom, the company merged Carbon Black with Symantec and formed a new business unit. Multiple handovers of Carbon Black in past few years, raised concerns about the solution\u2019s reliability for eSentire, prompting the company to migrate its client base to CRWD\u2019s Falcon platform.\n\nStrong Growth Prospects\n\nWith a rising number of crucial partnerships, client base and deepened product portfolio, CrowdStrike is on a strong growth trajectory and that is reflected in the company\u2019s last four earnings. The company\u2019s non-GAAP earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 15.8%.\n\nIn its last-reported first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings, CRWD beat the consensus mark both for earnings and revenues and witnessed significant year-over-year improvement.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, CRWD now expects revenues between $3,976.3-$4,010.7 million. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $4 billion, indicating growth of a whopping 30.8% year over year.\n\nNon-GAAP earnings for 2025 are anticipated in the band of $3.93-$4.03 per share. The consensus mark for fiscal non-GAAP earnings is $3.92 cents per share, suggesting growth of 27% year over year.\n\nConclusion\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s diversified product portfolio, strong partner base and expanding clientele make it an important player in this sphere. These strengths, coupled with its solid financial performance, position CrowdStrike as a promising opportunity for long-term growth.\n\nHowever, investors should wait for a better entry point for CrowdStrike, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), given the stretched valuation. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nCRWD is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 19.05X compared with the Zacks Internet Software industry\u2019s 2.59X and higher than the median of 15.25X.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "We\u2019re all online these days. Thanks to technology\u2019s exponential growth, we\u2019ve been hurtling through the digital age, making it easier for everyone to access the internet anytime and anywhere. With that ease of access, however, comes several threats. Personal information can be swiped off unsecured servers. Credit card details can be stolen. Lives can be ruined. That\u2019s why companies invest in cybersecurity\u2014and many investors invest in cybersecurity stocks, making it one of the most promising up-and-coming sectors in the market.\n\nAccording to a McKinsey report, annual cybersecurity attack damages by 2025 could reach\u00a0$10.5 trillion. This has made cybersecurity one of the fastest-growing sectors, as it is crucial in everyday life. So, today, let\u2019s look at three cybersecurity stocks leading the way. To get the list, I looked for companies with:\n\nMinimum 10% growth in full-year YOY EPS growth, A minimum buy rating from analysts, and a Positive YTD price return.\n\nThen, I sorted the list based on their full-year YOY earnings growth to ensure that I only focused on the companies that analysts love and the market buys and grows its earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nConsidered the leader in enterprise cyber security, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a global powerhouse that helps companies secure their network using artificial intelligence and automotive solutions.\n\nThe company provides its customers with a complete zero-trust solution that includes analytics, attack surface management, automation, and endpoint security solutions. It also has a joint venture with IBM to offer AI-powered security offerings.\n\nPalo Alto\u2019s FY\u201923 numbers showed significant growth, with revenue increasing 25% year over year and reaching $6.9 billion. Basic EPS also saw a significant turnaround, from a loss of 90 cents to a $1.45 per share profit, representing a 261% growth.\n\nPANW stock is trading 2% higher YTD. Meanwhile, analysts rate it a strong buy, signifying its potential for further price growth.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nA leader in endpoint protection solutions, CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) specializes in cybersecurity software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that delivers cloud-delivered protection of endpoints, identity, cloud workloads and data.\n\nIts Falcon platform delivers performance-driven protection using a lightweight agent architecture with cloud module integration of up to approximately 22 types. The company is expanding its partnership with Google Cloud to build cloud-native cybersecurity to secure cloud intrusions.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike reported a strong end to FY\u201924. Total and subscription revenue grew 36%, while ARR increased 34% YOY. GAAP net income also improved significantly, reaching $89.3 million from a loss of $183.2 million the previous year.\n\nAs a result, the company made a turnaround profit of $0.37 per share for the year. This is a strong comeback from the previous year\u2019s loss of $0.79 per share, representing a 147% improvement.\n\nCRWD stock is up 27.05% YTD and has a strong buy rating from 44 analysts. With a partnership with tech giant Alphabet and its Google Cloud and a turnaround performance for FY\u201923, it\u2019s a no-brainer that it\u2019s one of my top up-and-coming stocks to watch.\n\nAvePoint (AVPT)\n\nThe leader in enterprise-class cloud compliance solutions, AvePoint (NASDAQ:AVPT) is an IT and consulting firm that offers digital security, data handling and information technology operations under its cloud-native software platform.\n\nThe company\u2019s platform offers a combination of modularity in its cloud service architecture that seeks to resolve organizational operational challenges. AvePoint recently announced the addition of three new products to FedRAMP (moderate) authorization. These include AvePoint tyGraph, MaivenPoint Examena, and MaivenPoint Curricula, enabling organizations to remove the barriers to workplace innovation.\n\nLooking closer at its FY\u201923 report, AvePoint reported a 17% revenue growth year over year. This was primarily driven by its software-as-a-service (SaaS) segment, which reported an impressive 37% revenue increase. While the company is still operating at a loss, things are improving. 2023 ended with a $0.12 loss per share compared to last year\u2019s $0.22 loss.\n\nAVPT stock is up 14.18% YTD and has a strong buy rating from analysts.

CrowdStrike reported EPS of 93 cents, which was above the 89 cents expected amongst analysts. Revenue came in at $921 million, up 34% YOY and ahead of estimates calling for $905 million in sales.\n\nThe company\u2019s free cash flow stood at $322.5 million at quarter\u2019s end, up 42% from $227.4 million a year ago. Subscription revenue grew 34% to $872.2 million. In terms of guidance, CrowdStrike said that it expects revenue of $958.1 million to $961.2 million in the current second quarter of the year. The guidance is ahead of Wall Street sales forecasts of $955 million. Profits for Q2 are forecast at 98 cents to 99 cents per share, above consensus forecasts of 91 cents.\n\nWith its stock having more than doubled (up 123%) over the past 12 months, CrowdStrike has set itself apart from its competitors and established itself as the cybersecurity stock to own.\n\nHewlett Packard (HPE) Picture of Hewlett Packard Enterprise offices in Palo Alto, CA. HPE stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) is having its best day in many a moon, and at a 52-week high, after the information technology and computer hardware maker posted better-than-expected financial results. The share price of HPE is up 12% on news that it reported EPS of 42 cents a share, which beat consensus expectations of 39 cents. Revenue came in at $7.20 billion, topping the $6.80 billion forecast on Wall Street. Sales were up 3% from a year earlier.\n\nBest of all, management attributed the strong results to rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI) servers. Hewlett Packard is benefiting from an increased availability of Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100 microchips used in its servers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s, or HPE\u2019s, server segment posted quarterly revenue of $3.90 billion, up 18% YOY and above analyst expectations for $3.46 billion in sales. AI systems revenue at HPE more than doubled sequentially to $900 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nNews of the earning beat, driven by AI demand, was music to the ears of analysts and investors. HPE stock is now up 31% over the last 12 months.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) A BlackRock (BLK) sign out front of a BlackRock office in San Francisco, California. Growth Stocks\n\nSource: David Tran Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestment firm BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has a catalyst brewing with its new iShares Bitcoin Fund (NASDAQ:IBIT). Of the approximately 10 spot Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETFs currently offered in the U.S., BlackRock has emerged as the sector leader. In fact, BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF just surpassed $20 billion of assets under management (AUM), trouncing all similar funds.\n\nBlackRock reports that its ETF now holds 291,563 Bitcoins valued at $20.15 billion. Flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs are rebounding after slowing since mid-March when the price of BTC peaked at an all-time high of just under $74,000. Since May 16, net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have averaged $140 million per day, led by BlackRock\u2019s IBIT fund, which pulled in $1.10 billion over that period.\n\nBLK stock has risen 16% over the last 12 months and should continue to rise as the rally in cryptocurrencies accelerates and prices for digital assets appreciate.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "Technology connects billions of people and has changed how we communicate and obtain information.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s\u00a0hard to think of a time when people had to trudge through the rain to get to their local library. Now, you can find information on any subject with a few clicks.\n\nMany corporations have capitalized on innovative technology and have delivered impressive returns for their investors. However, some tech stocks look like dinosaurs while others\u00a0are continuing\u00a0to soar. Let\u2019s examine some of the top tech stocks that investors are considering.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) The META backed Threads app as a compelling alternative to Twitter. Social media application technology concept.\n\nSource: Cat Box / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) knows how to grab\u00a0people\u2019s\u00a0attention.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe social media giant profits from\u00a0people\u2019s time as they consume content on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\u00a0It\u2019s\u00a0been a winning formula for several years, as the stock is up by 175% over the past five years. Also, Meta Platforms is up by 38% year-to-date (YTD) and comes with a 27.5 P/E ratio.\n\nRecently, the firm began\u00a0to pay dividends which start\u00a0at 50 cents per share. The current yield is 0.42%. While some corporations offer dividends to signal that growth is slowing, Meta Platforms has been delivering solid results.\u00a0Q1 2024 revenue increased by 27%\u00a0year-over-year (YOY)\u00a0while net income soared by 117%\u00a0YOY.\n\nFurther, META focuses on the bottom line\u00a0ever\u00a0since a miserable 2022.\u00a0Shareholders have\u00a0benefitted greatly from this shift. Wall Street analysts are excited about the stock and have rated it as a\u00a0strong buy. The average price target suggests a 10% upside from current levels.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity firm Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) continues to deliver exceptional revenue growth.\u00a0The company reported 33% YOY revenue growth in\u00a0Q4 of 2024\u00a0and a shocking surge in net income. The firm reported a net profit of $53.7 million compared to a net loss of $47.5 million in the same period last year.\n\nAdditionally, Crowdstrike makes most of its revenue from recurring business, so it should continue to generate meaningful returns for several years. Annual recurring revenue reached $3.44 billion to wrap up fiscal 2024. This figure is 34% higher than the same period last year.\n\nThe stock has been booming for quite a while. Shares are up by 25% YTD, gaining 381% over the past five years. Currently, it trades at a\u00a079 forward\u00a0P/E ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd, Wall Street analysts have high hopes for Crowdstrike. The cybersecurity stock\u00a0is currently rated\u00a0as a strong buy\u00a0with\u00a0the average price target suggesting a\u00a030% gain from current levels.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been outpacing the stock market for several years as its AI chips\u00a0continue to\u00a0generate plenty of demand. The stock has more than doubled YTD while logging in gains above 3,000% over the past five years.\n\nThe company announced its latest\u00a0AI chips to gain more ground on its competition. This quick turnaround indicates Nvidia is doing what it can to maintain its strong lead over competing firms.\n\nNvidia has been reporting solid financial results for several years,\u00a0and that trend\u00a0continued in\u00a0Q1 of 2025. Revenue surged by 262% YOY\u00a0while\u00a0net income soared by 628% YOY.\u00a0The\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0announcement of a 10-for-1 stock split has attracted more investors who\u00a0have a chance of buying\u00a0shares at a lower price.\n\nWall Street analysts advocated for the stock long before its stock split announcement. The AI chip leader is rated as a strong buy\u00a0and has\u00a0a\u00a0projected 5% upside based on the average price target. Recent price targets offer a more optimistic picture, including a recent $1,500 price target. This highest forecast indicates that a 30% gain is possible.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another AI leader that continues to generate revenue and earnings growth due to its business verticals. The company has leading positions in cloud computing, business software, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence (AI) and advertising. Those components have resulted in a 12% YTD gain and a sterling 215% gain over the past five years.\n\nThird quarter of 2024 financials\u00a0showed plenty of promise.\u00a0Revenue increased by 17%\u00a0YOY\u00a0as demand for Microsoft Cloud\u00a0remains\u00a0strong. Meanwhile, net income came to $21.9 billion which was up by 20%\u00a0YOY. Microsoft Cloud revenue grew by 23%\u00a0YOY\u00a0and represents more than half of\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0total revenue.\n\nAlso, MSFT saw double-digit growth rates for its\u00a0\u201cProductivity and Business Processes\u201d\u00a0segment\u00a0as well as\u00a0its\u00a0\u201cMore Personal Computing\u201d\u00a0part of the business. The firm returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0yield currently stands at 0.73%. The company has maintained an\u00a0annualized dividend growth rate of 10.60% over the past decade.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a semiconductor company\u00a0that has been\u00a0performing well after missing out on the initial AI rally. Shares are\u00a0up\u00a0by an impressive 47% YTD and have tripled over the past five years.\u00a0Qualcomm stock trades at a 28 P/E ratio\u00a0and offers\u00a0a 1.65% yield.\u00a0The company has raised its dividend for 21 consecutive years and has a\u00a0dividend payout ratio\u00a0slightly above 40%.\n\nThe\u00a0firm\u2019s\u00a0Q2 of 2024 results\u00a0indicate the company is taking steps in the right direction to reinvigorate growth. After several quarters of declining revenue and earnings, Qualcomm reported 1% YOY revenue growth. While some growth is better than no growth, the company did a phenomenal job with its net income,\u00a0which was\u00a0up by 37% YOY.\n\nFinally, the corporation returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends.\u00a0Currently, the\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0quarterly dividend stands at $0.85 per share after\u00a0a recent 6.3% hike.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nTop-tier software company Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has delivered solid returns while holding\u00a0onto\u00a0a 31.5 P/E ratio and a 1.34% yield.\u00a0It has\u00a0\u201cgrowth at a reasonable\u201d\u00a0price and has been rewarding for long-term investors. The stock is up by 15% YTD and has gained 124% over the past five years.\n\nAdditionally, the company reported 7% YOY\u00a0revenue growth in Q3 of 2024 as cloud revenue pushed up results.\u00a0And Q3 cloud revenue came to $5.1 billion\u00a0which was up by\u00a025% YOY.\u00a0That represents almost 40% of the\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0total revenue. Also, Oracle expanded its net profit margins thanks to a 27% YOY improvement in net income.\n\nOracle only has a\u00a041% dividend payout ratio and has maintained an annualized dividend growth rate of 14.31% over the past decade. The low payout ratio and solid financials suggest that Oracle can maintain a double-digit growth rate for its dividend.\n\nCurrently, the software company\u00a0is\u00a0rated\u00a0as a\u00a0moderate buy with a projected 17% upside. The highest price target of $160 per share implies a 34% gain.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Website of Adobe (ADBE) Firefly seen in an iPhone. In Mar 2023 Adobe announced the beta launch of its new generative AI model Firefly.\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlso, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has\u00a0a lot of supporters in\u00a0Wall Street.\u00a0It\u2019s\u00a0rated as a moderate buy with a projected 42% upside\u00a0based on the average price target.\u00a0The highest price target of $703 suggests that Adobe stock can gain an additional 60%. The lowest price target of $445 per share still\u00a0suggests\u00a0that the\u00a0stock can achieve some upside based on current levels.\n\nThe creative software company is off to a bad start with a 24% YTD decline. Despite the recent struggles, Adobe is still up by 58% over the past five years. It\u2019s present P/E ratio stands at 42 .\n\nRecently, Adobe reported 11% YOY revenue growth in\u00a0Q1 of 2024.\u00a0The\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0remaining performance obligations stand at $17.58 billion,\u00a0which is\u00a0more than three times its Q1 of 2024 revenue of $5.18 billion.\n\nStill, the\u00a0corporation is making strides to reward shareholders\u00a0despite recent events.\u00a0Adobe repurchased roughly 3.1 million shares in the first quarter.\n\nOn this\u00a0date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CRWD, NVDA, and MSFT.

        "title": "Diversify Beyond Nvidia: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio",
        "content": "Whether right or wrong, Nvidia has become the face of artificial intelligence (AI) on Wall Street. It's not a fluke; Nvidia's growth exploded since early last year, and the stock's gains have made it a household name among investors.\n\nStill, it's worth pointing out that AI goes far beyond one company. You can buy and hold a stock like Nvidia, but don't dismiss the potential upside of some smaller companies that have the ingredients to become big winners down the road.\n\nHere are three AI stocks you can add to your long-term portfolio:\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nData is arguably the foundation of how AI works, so it would make sense that companies that best use their data might have a competitive advantage. That's the quick and dirty pitch for Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR).\n\nThe company builds custom software applications on its platforms -- Foundry, Gotham, and AIP -- that help organizations analyze their data in real time. Palantir works closely with the U.S. government, its allies, and the private sector, where expansion is happening quickly.\n\nAIP, or its Artificial Intelligence Platform, unlocked a new level of growth and could be the long-term catalyst that makes Palantir one of the world's largest businesses over the coming decades. AIP helps develop and deploy AI applications for government and businesses.\n\nThe value of AIP is evident throughout Palantir. Growth in commercial customers has accelerated to 69% year over year in the first quarter, mainly due to interest in AIP.\n\nPalantir is growing and profitable, with a balance sheet of $3.9 billion in cash and zero debt. Analysts believe the company's earnings will grow at an annualized rate of 27% over the next three to five years.\n\nThe company still has just 262 commercial customers in the U.S. That figure could grow for a long time if it continues to show the value of its AI technology for businesses.\n\n2. Snowflake\n\nAn organization's data isn't just sitting there, ready to go. Companies must securely store it, which creates a massive opportunity for Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW).\n\nThe company is a cloud-based data storage and analytics platform that can make it easy for customers to store their data and access it whenever they choose. Just think of data's various formats and sources; referencing data quickly becomes a matter of finding the needle in the haystack. That's where Snowflake helps.\n\nSnowflake has a usage-based billing model that enables customers to scale its products to their needs. And since data grows exponentially, companies should increase their use of Snowflake as their data expands. As proof, the business has a robust net revenue retention rate of 128%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlong with that organic revenue expansion is the opportunity to add new clients. Snowflake has roughly 9,822 customers today, and with 1.7 million C-corporations in the U.S. alone, there's a tremendous long-term runway. In all, it seems likely to enjoy many years of double-digit growth.\n\n3. CrowdStrike Holdings\n\nCybersecurity steadily moved toward the forefront of many businesses' priorities. Protecting data and digital assets is no longer optional because the potential costs of failing are too high -- the average breach causes millions of dollars in damages.\n\nSo companies are looking to next-generation security providers like CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD). The company operates a cloud-based platform that secures end points, cloud workloads, identities, and data. The platform adapts to real-time threats, making it far more effective than outdated technologies like antivirus protections.\n\nThe proof of how good CrowdStrike is lies in its stellar financial metrics. Annual revenue multiplied more than sevenfold over the past five years to $3 billion.\n\nThe company is also very profitable. CrowdStrike is converting 32% of its revenue to free cash flow, reinforcing a solid balance sheet that has $3.5 billion in cash versus $742 million in debt. Analysts believe it will grow earnings by 22% annually for the next three to five years.\n\nThe company has become famous for expanding via new product modules. Its addressable market is worth $100 billion today and could expand to $225 billion by the decade's end. That's a tremendous opportunity for a business doing just over $3 billion in sales today.\n\nInvestors should consider buying shares slowly because strong fundamentals have earned the stock a lofty valuation at 79 times earnings, which is expensive -- even for a company of CrowdStrike's caliber.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is holding a substantially profitable position in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock, according to analysts tracking the trades of Congress members and their families.\n\nUnusual Whales, a financial services platform that focuses on congressional insider trading, among other things, said on Wednesday that Pelosi has nearly $4 million in gains from the Nvidia call options her husband, Paul Pelosi, purchased in November. These call options allow investors to buy shares at a predetermined price.\n\n\u201cShe is up +210% in 197 days&still not sold her calls. Pelosi has made twenty times her salary,\u201d Unusual Whales wrote on X. \u201cHer portfolio is near all-time highs, up 93%.\u201d\n\nChristopher Josephs, co-founder of Autopilot\u2014an app that tracks and mirrors politicians' trades\u2014told FOX Business that while it's challenging to pinpoint the exact amount of Pelosi's initial investment due to the broad range of $1 million to $5 million in the filing, Unusual Whales' figures seem accurate.\n\n\"This year, the Pelosi Portfolio not only has a winner in Nvidia, but her other stocks have also performed well, including CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD), which is up 45% year-to-date and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which is up 27% year-to-date,\" Josephs told FOX.\n\n\"We estimate that her year-to-date performance based on her stock filings is 28%, which outperforms the SPY by 16.5%.\"\n\nWhen asked for comment, a spokesperson for Rep. Pelosi stated, \"Speaker Pelosi does not own any stocks, and she has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions.\" FOX Business also contacted Paul Pelosi to seek a comment.\n\nThe statement from Pelosi's office is nearly identical to one provided by the former speaker's communications director to FOX News Digital in 2022, when one of her husband's Nvidia trades faced intense scrutiny.\n\nThat year, Paul Pelosi acquired over $1 million in Nvidia call options just weeks before a congressional vote on providing substantial subsidies to the chip manufacturing industry. He sold them after she faced criticism over the timing of the trades.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNancy Pelosi has made 20 times her salary in just one trade\n\nDelta seeks new Seattle flight as airlines jockey over DC slots\n\nChina's Nio expects Q2 EV sales to more than double\n\nView comments",

The company's total revenue climbed to $921.04 million, marking a 33% increase from the previous year, driven by a strong subscription base that constitutes 95% of the total revenue. Net income attributable to CrowdStrike experienced an astronomical rise to $42.82 million, a staggering 8,621% increase year-over-year. This remarkable profitability is further underscored by the net cash provided by operating activities, which amounted to $383.23 million, reflecting the company's robust business model and operational excellence. With a clear focus on innovation and strategic market positioning, CrowdStrike continues to solidify its status as a dominant force in the cybersecurity landscape. Decoding CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (CRWD): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nFounded in 2011 and going public in 2019, CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) has rapidly become a leading name in the cybersecurity space.

The recent SEC 10-Q filing on 2024-06-05 provides a window into the company's financial health and strategic positioning. This SWOT analysis aims to dissect the intricate details of CrowdStrike's operations, highlighting the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as gleaned from the latest financial data and strategic disclosures.\n\nStrengths\n\nMarket Leadership and Innovation: CrowdStrike's robust revenue growth, with a 33% year-over-year increase, is a testament to its market leadership. The company's focus on innovation is evident from its substantial investments in research and development, which grew by 31% from the previous year.

This financial strength enables the company to invest in strategic growth opportunities and navigate market uncertainties effectively.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on Subscription Revenue: While CrowdStrike's subscription-based revenue model provides recurring income, it also exposes the company to risks associated with customer retention and subscription renewals. Any significant churn in the customer base could adversely impact the company's revenue streams.\n\nHigh Operating Expenses: Despite strong revenue growth, CrowdStrike's operating expenses remain high, accounting for 75% of total revenue. Sales and marketing expenses, in particular, are substantial, indicating a need for more efficient customer acquisition and retention strategies.\n\nInternational Expansion Challenges: As CrowdStrike continues to expand globally, it faces challenges related to compliance with diverse international regulations and competition in new markets.

By capitalizing on the growing demand for advanced cybersecurity solutions, the company can further enhance its market position.\n\nStrategic Acquisitions and Partnerships: CrowdStrike's strong cash flow position enables it to pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships that can broaden its product portfolio and accelerate growth. By integrating complementary technologies and expertise, the company can offer more comprehensive solutions to its customers.\n\nTechnological Advancements: The rapid pace of technological change offers CrowdStrike the opportunity to leverage emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop innovative security solutions. Staying at the forefront of technological advancements can drive future growth and differentiation in the market.\n\nThreats\n\nIntense Competition: The cybersecurity industry is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. CrowdStrike must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its competitive advantage and prevent erosion of its customer base to competitors.\n\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks: As a global cybersecurity provider, CrowdStrike is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations. Non-compliance with these regulations can result in significant penalties and damage to the company's reputation.\n\nEconomic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as fluctuations in exchange rates, inflation, and global economic instability can impact CrowdStrike's operations and financial performance. The company must navigate these uncertainties while managing costs and maintaining growth.\n\nIn conclusion, CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) exhibits a strong financial foundation and market leadership in the cybersecurity industry. The company's strengths in innovation, profitability, and operational cash flow position it well for continued success. However, it must address its reliance on subscription revenue, high operating expenses, and international expansion challenges to sustain growth. The opportunities presented by emerging cybersecurity markets, strategic acquisitions, and technological advancements are promising, but CrowdStrike must also be vigilant about the threats posed by intense competition, regulatory risks, and economic uncertainties. Overall, the company's strategic focus and robust financials suggest a positive outlook, with the potential to leverage its strengths and opportunities\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "Cyber security provider CrowdStrike CRWD saw its stock spike +12% today after beating its first quarter top and bottom-line expectations Tuesday evening.\n\nInvestors may be wondering if it\u2019s still time to get in on the rally with CrowdStrike\u2019s stock soaring +33% year to date and now up more than +100% in the last year to largely outperform the broader indexes and many on its cyber security peer\u2019s including Gen Digital\u2019s GEN +40%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQ1 Review\n\nAs a leader in next-generation endpoint protection, CrowdStrike posted Q1 EPS of $0.93 which beat estimates by 4% and soared 63% from $0.57 a share in the comparative quarter. The profit increase was driven by Q1 sales of $921.04 million coming in 2% better than expected while climbing 33% year over year.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOther highlights for Q1 included CrowStrike recording records in subscription growth margins at 80% and free cash flow at $322 million. Boldly, Co-founder and CEO George Kurtz stated CrowdStrike is the only cybersecurity vendor of scale delivering this level of growth and profitability. Notably, this bolsters CrowdStrike's positional power even over Gen Digital\u2019s iconic Norton Anti-Virus, Internet Security, and System Works brands. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI Leader\n\nArtificial Intelligence has helped boost CrowdStrike\u2019s expansion with the company revealing that its AI native platform wins at scale in every geography, market segment, and solution area. To that point, CrowdStrike\u2019s popular Falcon platform has addressed the need to consolidate cybersecurity at scale.\n\nImpressive Guidance\n\nFueling the rally in CRWD, CrowdStrike expects Q2 sales at a range of $958.3 million-$961.2 million which came in above the current Zacks Consensus of $956.18 million or 30% growth (Current Qtr below). CrowStrike now expects total sales for its current fiscal 2025 to be over $3.97 billion to $4.1 billion which would also exceed expectations (Current Year). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSecond quarter non-GAAP net income was guided at $245.7-$247.8 million or EPS of $0.98-$0.99 which edged estimates of $0.90 a share or 21% growth.\n\nEven better, the company now expects full-year non-GAAP net income for FY25 in the range of $985.6 million-$1.01 billion or $3.93-$4.03 per share and above the Current Zacks EPS Consensus of $3.90 or 26% growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as earnings estimate revisions have remained higher for its current FY25 and FY26. Furthermore, EPS estimates could trend higher in the coming weeks following CrowdStrike\u2019s strong Q1 results and elevated guidance.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To Know\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) jumped 12.6% in the pre-market session after the company reported a \"beat and raise\" quarter. CrowdStrike narrowly exceeded analysts' revenue and annual recurring revenue (ARR) expectations, indicating continued customer investment in its products. Remaining performance obligations (RPO - leading revenue indicator) came in even stronger, accelerating to 42% y/y from 37% last quarter and ahead of analysts' expectations. Looking ahead, CrowdStrike raised its full-year revenue and EPS guidance, which beat Wall Street's projections. The outlook was impressive, given what management considers a \"challenging macro environment.\" Zooming out, this was a great quarter, showing that the company is staying on target.\n\nIs now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nCrowdStrike's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 14 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for CrowdStrike and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago, when the stock gained 25.2% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue and ARR (annual recurring revenue) beating by a slight margin but very convincingly on operating profit. Keeping with that theme, while forward guidance for the next quarter and the full year were only slightly above expectations, non-GAAP EPS guidance was more convincingly ahead, showing better-than-expected profitability. Lastly, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) warned of weakness in security spending a few weeks ago when it reported earnings, sending waves of caution across the sector. Cybersecurity peers that reported after Palo Alto put up mixed results, which kept investors on edge for CrowdStrike's results. These results could signal a shift in sentiment given CrowdStrike's popularity within the cyber security space, especially considering its cloud security capabilities.\n\nCrowdStrike is up 35.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $334.17 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $351.47 from May 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $5,762.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "title": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) Jumps 7% as Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates",
        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\u2019s CRWD shares jumped 7% during Tuesday\u2019s extended trading session after the cloud-based cybersecurity solution provider reported better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2025 results. Both revenues and earnings witnessed a significant improvement on a year-over-year basis as well.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s fiscal first-quarter non-GAAP earnings increased to 93 cents per share from the year-ago quarter\u2019s 57 cents. Quarterly earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents and came ahead of management\u2019s guidance of 89-90 cents. The robust bottom-line performance was mainly driven by higher revenues and better cost management.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s fiscal first-quarter revenues of $921 million rose 33% year over year and surpassed the consensus mark of $904.8 million. The top line was also higher than the company\u2019s guidance of $902.2-$905.8 million. The strong adoption of the Falcon platform and better sales execution mainly aided top-line growth in the first quarter.\n\nStrong adoption of the Falcon platform can be attributable to its ability to consolidate cybersecurity functions at scale, meeting the market's demand for a unified AI-powered solution. The expansion of available modules has enhanced the platform's value, leading to increased adoption, particularly in cloud, Identity and Falcon Next-Gen SIEM modules.\n\nCrowdStrike Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nCrowdStrike price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | CrowdStrike Quote\n\nTop Line in Detail\n\nSubscription revenues (94.7% of the total revenues) jumped 34% year over year to $872.2 million. Professional services revenues (5.3% of the total revenues) rose 18% year over year to $49 million. Our estimates for the Subscription and Professional Services segments were pegged at $844.8 million and $59.2 million, respectively.\n\nAs of Apr 30, 2024, annual recurring revenues (ARR) were $3.65 billion, up 33% year over year. The company added $211.7 million to its net new ARR in the reported quarter. Our projections for ARR and net new ARR were $3.62 billion and $367 million, respectively.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s subscription customers, who adopted five or more cloud modules, represented 65% of the total subscription customers, those with six or more cloud modules accounted for 44% and those with seven or more cloud modules represented 28% as of Apr 30, 2024.\n\nOperating Details\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s non-GAAP gross profit increased 33.4% to $721.3 million in the fiscal first quarter from $540.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The non-GAAP gross margin remained flat at 78%. The strong gross margin performance was primarily driven by the company\u2019s ability to command stable pricing, supported by the exceptional customer value delivered by its Falcon platform, as well as its continued investments in data center and workload optimization.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe non-GAAP subscription gross profit soared 34.5% year over year to $701.5 million, while the gross margin remained flat at 80% on a year-over-year basis. The non-GAAP professional gross profit rose 4.7% to $19.8 million, while the gross margin fell 500 bps to 41% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 23% to $522.5 million from $424.6 million in the year-ago quarter. However, as a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses declined to 57% from 61% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nNon-GAAP sales and marketing (S&M) expenses jumped 21.4% year over year to $297.2 million. Non-GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses climbed 25% year over year to $168 million. Non-GAAP general and administrative (G&A) expenses increased 26% year over year to $57.3 million. As a percentage of revenues, S&M, R&D and G&A expenses contracted by 300 bps, 100 bps and 100 bps to 32%, 18% and 6%, respectively.\n\nThe non-GAAP operating income surged 72% to $198.7 million from the year-ago quarter\u2019s $115.9 million, mainly driven by higher revenues. The non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter improved to 22% from 17% in the previous year\u2019s quarter, which primarily benefited from a higher gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.\n\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\n\nAs of Apr 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $3.7 billion. CrowdStrike had a long-term debt of $743 million.\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, CRWD generated operating and free cash flows of $383 million and $322 million, respectively.\n\nGuidance\n\nCrowdStrike initiated guidance for the fiscal second quarter and revised the projections for fiscal 2025. For the fiscal second quarter, CrowdStrike anticipates revenues between $958.3 million and $961.2 million. The non-GAAP operating income is expected in the band of $208.3-$210.5 million. Non-GAAP net income is forecasted in the range of $245.7-$247.8 million. The company expects non-GAAP earnings to be in the 98-99 cents per share range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues and non-GAAP earnings are pegged at $956.2 million and 90 cents per share, respectively.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, CRWD now expects revenues between $3,976.3 million and $4,010.7 million compared with the previously projected revenues of $3,924.9-$3,989 million. The updated non-GAAP operating income for fiscal 2025 is now projected in the band of $890.1-$916.5 million compared with the previously announced range of $863.6-$913 million.\n\nThe company now expects the non-GAAP net income in the range of $985.6-$1,012 million compared with the previous guidance of $940.3-$989.7 million. Non-GAAP earnings are now anticipated in the band of $3.93-$4.03 per share. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 revenues and non-GAAP earnings are pegged at $3.97 billion and $3.90 cents per share, respectively.\n\nZacks Rank and Other Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, CrowdStrike carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. delivered first-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations, despite a pullback in spending that has challenged its cybersecurity rivals.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nModi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority BlackRock, Citadel Back Texas Stock Exchange in Challenge to NYSE Modi\u2019s Magic Is Fading Fast.

The company posted adjusted earnings of 93 cents per share, above a 90-cent projection. Shares of the Austin, Texas-based company were trading at $320.41 at 10:08 a.m. in New York on Wednesday after closing at $305.58 on Tuesday.\n\nExpectations were high heading into the company\u2019s earnings release. The company\u2019s shares had roughly doubled over the past year, handing it a valuation that makes it more expensive than nearly all of its rivals. That\u2019s despite a string of disappointing earnings results from software peers rocked by a pullback in enterprise spending.\n\nJust last month, rival Palo Alto Networks Inc. slid after giving a downbeat forecast for the current period, renewing concerns about a slowdown in cybersecurity demand. The cyber solutions provider Fortinet Inc. also posted a miss in first-quarter billings, citing weakness in Europe.\n\nCrowdStrike, however, has said its single-platform strategy has allowed the company to continue to gain market share.\n\nThe company\u2019s consolidated platform \u201ccreates a wide competitive moat,\u201d George Kurtz, CrowdStrike\u2019s chief executive officer, said in the company\u2019s statement Tuesday.\n\nCrowdStrike has often sought to distinguish itself from Microsoft Corp. and its cyber offerings. During the company\u2019s earnings call on Tuesday, Kurtz raised a recent US government report that criticized Microsoft\u2019s security culture, saying it resulted in an \u201coutpouring of requests\u201d from the market.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a widespread crisis of confidence among security and IT teams within the Microsoft security customer base,\u201d he said.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s recently expanded partnership with Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services, was expected to be a focus on the company\u2019s earnings call Tuesday. As part of the pact, AWS dropped other security products in favor of CrowdStrike\u2019s cyber threat protection and response offerings.\n\n(Updates with share price after market open, additional quotes in seventh paragraph)\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

Reported EPS is $0.93, expectations were $0.895.\n\nOperator: Good day, everyone, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to CrowdStrike Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand it over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Maria Riley. Please go ahead.\n\nMaria Riley: Good afternoon, and thank you for your participation today. With me on the call are George Kurtz, President and Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of CrowdStrike; and Burt Podbere, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives, growth, including projections, and expected performance, including our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2025 and any assumptions for fiscal periods beyond that, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this call.\n\nWhile we believe any forward-looking statements we make are reasonable, actual results could differ materially because the statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including the section titled risk factors in the company's quarterly and annual report. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, excluding revenue, all financial measures disclosed on this call will be non-GAAP.\n\nA discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is currently available in our earnings press release, which may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.crowdstrike.com or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC today.

We started the year from a position of momentum and exceptional strength, outperforming our guided metrics. Our AI native platform wins at scale, every geography, every market segment and every solution area. CrowdStrike delivered a record Q1, record Q1 net new ARR of $212 million, growing 22% year-over-year. Record ending ARR of $3.65 billion, growing 33% year-over-year. Record subscription gross margin of 80% and record free cash flow of $322 million, reaching 35% of revenue and a free cash flow Rule of 68, making us the only cybersecurity vendor of scale delivering this level of growth and profitability. We achieved all of these records while closely managing every P&L line, delivering significant year-over-year operating leverage and our fifth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability.\n\nEven as we continue investing in growth, we're adding sales capacity, investing in our market leading brand, and accelerating innovation while firmly on the path to $10 billion in ending ARR. The foundational theme underpinning CrowdStrike's result is the power of the Falcon platform to consolidate cybersecurity at scale. This is coupled with the market's unequivocal desire for a single AI powered software platform consolidator. We're landing with more modules than ever before. The number of deals involving cloud, Identity or Falcon Next-Gen SIEM modules more than doubled year-over-year and we're closing some of our largest deals ever. We're consistently hearing that customers want to partner with us as they consolidate, standardizing their cybersecurity future on the Falcon platform and investing their trust in CrowdStrike as cybersecurity's North Star.\n\nLet me explain why. We built the right architecture from the start, the industry's lightest weight, easiest to install sensor, embedded with AI, no system reboot required, a single AI native platform console, not disparate stitched together or siloed multi platforms. Our architecture built from the start with what I refer to as gold plated plumbing allows the Falcon platform to gracefully land, retrieve data once and then flight, infinite security, IT, data and compliance capabilities without any friction. This is the definition of a true platform and our platform strategy from Inception continues to deliver the results. Deals with eight plus modules grew 95% year-over-year. Our 28 modules are best-in-class on a standalone basis as rated by applicable leading industry analysts.\n\nYet combined and natively built into the single Falcon platform, our solution modules work even better together, unlocking customer value characteristics of a virtuous flywheel. The sum of platform adoption is even greater than the individual parts. The Falcon platform's differentiated architecture creates a technological competitive moat around our ability to be cybersecurity's premier platform consolidator. This is something you can acquire or fix later. You must build it right from the start. Our platform architecture delivers the following unique customer outcomes. Through consolidation, the Falcon platform delivers faster and more effective cybersecurity than ever before, our AI native platform is consistently evolving to close the gap between detection and response, compressing alert to resolution time scales from days and hours to seconds in real-time.\n\nAnd now with Charlotte AI, customers are experiencing more platform utility at faster speeds, shrinking hours of their security work days into minutes. Threat hunting is supercharged, response and remediation are revolutionized. The AI powered SOC is no longer a vision, it's a reality. We stand out in our ability to secure diverse attack surfaces with the industry's highest protection levels, expanding cloud, data, device, identity, third-party sources and beyond, natively alerting in one place and automatically responding across the platform at machine speed. There's no console, hide and go seek, no separate platforms with their own UI languages, no multi-agent bloat and no stitched data silos. Through consolidation, the Falcon platform delivers extreme cost savings.\n\nThe more modules customers adopt, the more cost savings they realize. The Falcon platform consolidates point and pseudo platform vendors across point cloud security fragments like CWP, CSPM, ASPM, DSPM and CIEM products, Identity protection, SIEM, Threat Intel Feeds, data protection and DLP, vulnerability management, attack service management, compliance, endpoint management suites and legacy AV and Next-Gen AV and EDR. As an industry, organizations are buying many promises, unfortunately, they are left with wasteful shelf wear, point product learning curves, and features that failed to deliver end-to-end outcomes. The longtime cybersecurity outage of defense and depth has led to a new phenomenon, expense and depth, consolidating on the Falcon platform reverses the ever increasing cost curve.\n\nA recent IDC report quantifies CrowdStrike's extreme cost savings. For every $1 invested in Falcon Solutions, our customers recognized $6 of cost savings. Our customers came to us asking for new ways to adopt the Falcon platform even faster. Instead of acquiring Falcon module by module, we developed the Falcon Flex subscription model. Falcon Flex customers enjoy the best prices for the products they want today and tomorrow, while eliminating procurement and legal cycles from module use. The outcome for CrowdStrike is even broader platform adoption. Unlike vendors who pedal wasteful ELAs, our customers utilize what they purchase because when you buy what you want and need, when you want and need it, utilization is natural. We're not reclassifying, recounting, or repositioning existing business to concoct perceived platform value.\n\nWhen a platform delivers real value, you don't have to give it away. In the three quarters, since we've built the Falcon Flex program, the customers who have subscribed to this new licensing model represent over $500 million in deal value, growing our share of customer wallet while consolidating and simplifying their security. Applying IDC's analysis would imply Falcon Flex has assisted customers in saving more than $3 billion that would have been spent on other products. Now that's extreme cost savings and indicative of the platform momentum we are seeing with new and existing customers. Through consolidation, the Falcon platform delivers innovation to solve tomorrow's cybersecurity as well as broader IT and data problems. Our position as cybersecurity's consolidation platform keeps CrowdStrike innovating to lead the industry forward.\n\nThis focus has allowed us to ship game changing products at rapid pace. Within months of our Bionic acquisition, we fully integrated ASPM into our Falcon Cloud Security suite. Over the past few months, we brought our LogScale next-gen SIEM into the console of all of our customers, feeding their utilization of Falcon to replace legacy SIEMs. And more recently, following yet another major Microsoft reach and CISA, Cyber Safety Review Board's findings, we received an outpouring of requests from the market for help. We decided enough is enough. There's a widespread crisis of confidence among security and IT teams within the Microsoft security customer base. At the request of organizations saddled with Microsoft E5 licensing, we delivered Falcon for Defender, a platform on-ramp to help organizations of all sizes start utilizing Falcon to secure their Microsoft Defender usage.\n\nFalcon for Defender is delivered via the CrowdStrike sensor encompassing our industry leading OverWatch threat hunting services as well as mission critical reporting to help security teams do their job. With Falcon for Defender organizations using Microsoft now have what we call Vsquared. Validation and Verification, a missing third-party protection layer for their security programs. And with our sensor already deployed on customer systems, we're dropping anchor on the beachfront real estate to not only transform cybersecurity but also stop breaches. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. CISOs now have the ability to reduce monoculture risk from only using Microsoft products and cloud services. Our innovation continues at break-neck pace, multiplying the reasons for the market to consolidate on Falcon.\n\nThousands of organizations are consolidating on the Falcon platform, there are a few that stood out from the quarter. A seven figure deal in a Fortune-100 healthcare company who was using Microsoft and experienced a breach. Our industry leading IR team deployed more than 46,000 sensors in days stopping the adversary, restarting business, and importantly keeping this business out of promotional vendor fanfare. This customer immediately adopted Falcon Complete, Identity, Falcon Cloud Security, LogScale next-gen SIEM, and Charlotte AI. In addition to removing Microsoft security products, they were able to move off their vulnerability management vendor and their legacy SIEM too. The consolidation outcome, 75% reduction in agent footprint by consolidating to our single agent and a 700% improvement in mean time to detect and respond, taking average alert triage times from four-plus hours down to minutes.\n\nWe stopped the breach, displacing more than three vendors along the way and now this customer experiences not only lower TCO but also cybersecurity outcomes they hadn't thought possible. A seven figure deal in a large Middle Eastern power and utilities provider that experienced many incidents using a regional point product endpoint vendor. These incidents were each preventable with the Falcon platform's AI defenses. Standardizing the Falcon platform, this customer adopted CrowdStrike for Endpoint, identity, cloud, and next-gen SIEM, consolidating five security vendors down to just one in a few short months during the deal cycle. Lastly, our focus on solving cybersecurity and IT use cases inspired a multinational services customer headquartered in Japan to consolidate on CrowdStrike in a seven figure expansion deal.\n\nAcquiring four additional modules, they successfully eliminated Tanium, a legacy AV vendor and a vulnerability management provider. This deal illustrates existing customers taking the opportunity to further consolidate on Falcon beyond just security. We have the platform, data gravity, and trust to make consolidation turnkey for security and IT teams alike. These deals highlight the tempo and scale of Falcon consolidation. It's not on a PowerPoint slide, it's inside a single console with a single sensor and delivered on a single platform. What we see are prospects and customers using consolidation as an opportunity to transform creating expense and depth for cybersecurity that's better, faster, and more cost effective. Consolidation isn't just a phenomenon happening with end customers, it's also a priority, embraced and prioritized by our partners too.\n\nIn our MSSP business, one of our fastest growing segments, partners are coming to us to migrate their customers off legacy and substandard point products as well as multi-platform vendors. In a large seven figure deal eSentire, an industry leading MSSP selected the Falcon platform to migrate hundreds of Carbon Black customers in mass, representing an exodus of nearly 0.5 million endpoints. This is a prime example of an industry leading MDR that developed their own award-winning services on the Falcon platform, consolidating on CrowdStrike. And our expanded partnership with Mandiant and Google Cloud announced at the RSA conference, Mandiant is migrating its Mandiant-managed defense MDR customers to the Falcon platform. Recognizing our market leadership and the need to deliver services on the best technology platform, CrowdStrike is the natural choice to migrate their customers off legacy AV and other point products.\n\nAnd in our channel ecosystem at large, we're seeing partners deprioritizing other vendors on their line cards to consolidate their time, headcount, and go-to-market focus on CrowdStrike. Our top 50 partners in every geo are growing and telling us they're doing less and less with other vendors, instead increasing their focus and business results on Falcon. Partners are a key driver of market consolidation, both representing our technology to their end-customers and also consolidating their efforts away from anecdotal declining point feature vendors. The power to consolidate on a single platform requires having the right technologies at the right time delivered on the right platform. Our investments in hyper growth solution businesses continue to deliver market leading capabilities and record results.\n\nHere's our Q1 color on cloud security, identity protection and LogScale next-gen SIEM as well as several platform innovation areas. Cloud utilization is reaching unprecedented highs. This is largely driven by the AI revolution of the past few quarters. Today, every company is or is quickly becoming an AI company. Every CISO, CIO, and Board member I speak with is experimenting with using AI in new ways. We all know that AI is transformative and this transformation is happening in public and private clouds. The cloud is foundational technology for building AI models, operationalizing AI and integrating AI into existing technologies. The only way to safely harness the transformative nature of AI is through best-in-class security that operates at the speed and scale of AI built natively with AI with CrowdStrike.\n\nAs hyperscalers print remarkable results as NVIDIA continues to amaze and as AI hardware spend reaches gold rush levels, estimated to be north of $60 billion in the last 12 months, CrowdStrike is at the epicenter of securing the workloads driving the AI revolution. We're the next conversation. Jensen Huang, Founder and CEO of NVIDIA recently validated this by stating in our Q1 partnership announcement that, quote, Pairing NVIDIA accelerated computing and generative AI with CrowdStrike cybersecurity can give enterprises unprecedented visibility into threats to help them better protect their businesses. End quote. And this is why industry leaders across every vertical, including the Gen-AI companies themselves are choosing Falcon Cloud Security to secure their heterogeneous cloud environments consolidating multiple point products on the Falcon platform.\n\nHere's a lighthouse example. One of the world's leading hyperscalers grew their adoption of the Falcon platform, standardizing on the Falcon cloud security in an eight figure deal. In a public press release, this customer and partner extolled the unified nature of our security platform and their ability to consolidate multiple cloud security point products on Falcon Cloud Security. Our joint go-to-market partnership has evolved to focus on Falcon Cloud security where CrowdStrike rises above other vendors to enable secure cloud consumption. Driving our cloud security customer wins is the market embracing our runtime centric cloud detection and response vision that focuses on real time cloud visibility and protection. Offering features like cloud attack path analysis, API based side scanning, and most recently integrated ASPM and CDR sets us apart as the only solution on the market that spans code to application to the infrastructure on which everything runs. Security personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\n\nOur latest acquisition of Flow furthers our competitive moat, adding in the industry's only runtime DSPM securing data both at rest and in motion. Falcon Cloud Security has surpassed a garden of unicorns, decacorns, and legacy vendors as one of the largest cloud security businesses in the market. As of Q1, Falcon has been selected by 62 of the Fortune 100 as their cloud security provider of choice. CrowdStrike pioneered the creation of the identity detection and response category. Our identity protection module continues to be the only single agent solution on the market, giving us a major competitive advantage. Our active directory expertise has evolved to now support increasingly popular cloud identity solutions such as Microsoft Entra ID, formerly known as Azure AD, giving us the ability to support diverse customers wherever their identities reside.\n\nOur sustained focus on identity protection continues to pay dividends, not only winning deals, but also with industry analysts where CrowdStrike was named the overall leader in KuppingerCole's inaugural ITDR Compass. A key customer win from the quarter includes, a seven-figure deal with a large healthcare provider who was stuck in a Broadcom contract and increasingly being pushed towards a multi-platform hardware provider's password products. Our identity threat protection module was a game changer for this customer, deploying us to more than 100,000 devices and allowing us to replace these other two vendors. Identity protection led to an 85% better meantime to respond for identity based attacks and motivated this customer's significant cyber transformation.\n\nOne of the solution areas I'm most excited about is our LogScale next-gen SIEM business. There's certainly no shortage of market activity in the SIEM space where consolidation is a foot with M&A activity impacting Splunk and more recently Exabeam and QRadar, more happened in the SIEM market over the past few months than in decades. In the wake of this consolidation, the demand environment is ripe. Each of these consolidation moves creates immediate opportunity zones. Organizations are iconoclastically questioning their legacy SIEM choices and looking for new, better and more cost effective ways to run their SOC in the AI era. With CrowdStrike representing more than 80% of the data going into today's SIEMs, we are naturally placed to disrupt, consolidate and chart the future of the SIEM market.\n\nThis is because our LogScale next-gen SIEM is already natively in the Falcon platform, already ingesting, visualizing and actioning all first party CrowdStrike data for all of our customers. While other vendors must buy their way into this market acquiring legacy technology, our flag is already firmly planted and flying. Our goal is to win the hearts and minds of customers through superior technology and outcomes, not ELAs, forced migrations, and traps. Here's why we're winning. We have the right technology. Our next-gen SIEM immediately solves one of the biggest and most costly SIEM challenges, ingestion of data. CrowdStrike data natively resides in the platform requiring zero transportation costs, zero storage cost, and zero configuration.\n\nWe have also made it easy to ingest data from third-party sources. Once the data is in the platform, users benefit from our head-turning incident workbench, providing curated alert visualization, delivering on the promises of XDR like never seen before. Our next-gen SIEM is created for security users by security users, making running a cybersecurity program easier and more data driven. And coupled with Charlotte AI going from an idea to action, context to conquest, and of course, detection to response is supercharged for the AI era. At our recent partner symposium in Asia and Europe, we received standing ovations with viewers commenting that next-gen SIEM is our biggest industry-changing innovation. We have the content, with over 500 integrations, we welcome data from all sources to call the Falcon platform home.\n\nWhile many competitors are closed and complicated in what data they ingest, we are open, the melting pot of cyber and IT data. Our ecosystem is a proxy for the cybersecurity market at large. For years, we've collaborated closely with ISVs of all kinds from startups and innovators in our Falcon Fund portfolio to industry stalwarts across cybersecurity and the broader IT market. With hundreds of native vendor specific connectors as well as a generic log ingester, bringing data into next-gen SIEM is easier and faster than ever before. And once the data is in, cybersecurity experiences are enriched with the Falcon platform illustrating alert specific, attack surface specific and campaign specific events coupled with automated response through Fusion SOAR playbooks and Charlotte AI actions.\n\nTo date, Fusion SOAR is used by 47% of our top 5,000 customers who have created more than 135,000 custom workflows, processing more than 155 billion signals weekly to automate actions across the Falcon platform and third-party products. We have the right services, helping organizations move into their next-gen SIEM is a partner-led opportunity. Today's SIEMs were installed, configured, and oftentimes managed by partners. Partners see where the puck is going and have approached CrowdStrike to build their next-gen SIEM practices. These practices span data governance, data movement, dashboard configuration, and automation response creation as well as managed SIEM services, system integrators like Deloitte, EY, HCL Tech as well as SIEM specific partners like Net Builder are leading the movement with CrowdStrike as their next-gen SIEM platform of choice.\n\nHere's an example of a noteworthy customer win. The Global 2,000 manufacturing and machine system conglomerate with more than 100,000 employees left Splunk for LogScale next-gen SIEM in an eight-figure deal. Together with Accenture, we were able to successfully and swiftly migrate numerous data sources as well as ongoing SIEM management to the Falcon platform, delivering the outcome of consolidation, cost-savings as well as longer data retention, and faster alert response times. We have the technology platform, the content, the partners, the customers and the native data gravity to transform the SIEM market. And it's happening right now. Outside of our cloud, identity, and next-gen SIEM hyper growth businesses, new platform innovation areas are quickly taking flight.\n\nDemand for each of these products is exceeding our expectations, driven by both the innovative nature of our technology, but also secular consolidation market factors and frustration with legacy incumbents. First, data protection. Frustration with legacy DLP remains at a fever pitch where logging into these products is akin to taking a time machine back to the 90s. In a little more than a quarter, we've sold our data protection module to several hundred customers, many of which are Fortune 1000 accounts, delivering results indicative of a hyper growth startup. We win because we scratched the consolidation itch, delivering the compliance necessities without anything new to deploy and manage. Data protection coupled with Flow's DSPM are important components of our ability to natively secure AI as well.\n\nAnd with data becoming increasingly important for AI model development, customers want more than back in the disaster recovery for the data. Data protection is laying the groundwork for another multibillion adjacent Falcon market. Next Falcon for IT, the desire to move away from endpoint management point products is pronounced and exceeding our expectations. Organizations are looking to Falcon to deliver enterprise search, patching, deployment, device health and more, all from the same sensor. It's a very logical add on and our pipeline is already in the eight figures since shifting this module a little more than a quarter ago. And lastly, Charlotte AI, every CISO is eager to see their employees become more productive. Every CISO wants their cybersecurity to be faster.\n\nThe productivity gains are real and the benefits of making cybersecurity easier conversational and instant multiply the cybersecurity outcomes the Falcon platform creates. While still early, our POV close rate is close to 90%, reflecting excitement for Charlotte AI. Despite each of these solutions areas being young in the Falcon Nest, the feedback from prospects, customers, and partners show us we're on the right path for these technologies to be meaningful growth drivers and competitive differentiators. CrowdStrike's innovation engine is just another reason why customers have confidence in Falcon as cybersecurity's platform consolidator for today and tomorrow. In closing, I'm excited about the consolidation CrowdStrike is driving in the market, the business results we're delivering, and most importantly, the Falcon platform's societal impact of stopping breaches.\n\nOver the past 12 months, our industry leading incident responders in our partner network used Falcon to respond to thousands of breaches, cementing CrowdStrike as the industry's incident response authority. These engagements often convert to net new Falcon customers. Delivering a Q1 like the one we're announcing today is a strong reflection not only of the technological superiority of the Falcon platform, but also of the passion, the tenacity, and the mission focused from the very best team in cybersecurity. While the talent war is ongoing, CrowdStrike remains a career destination. Many vendors take great pride in best place to work designations. I'd like to point to a figure that dimensionalizes CrowdStrike as cybersecurity's very best place to work.\n\nOver the past five quarters, we received more than 687,000 applications from individuals who want to work for CrowdStrike. These professionals decided that CrowdStrike would be the ideal venue to build a career. In hiring low-single-digit thousands of these individuals, our acceptance rate is low, a lower acceptance rate than to every Ivy League institution. It's figures like this one that send a clear message to me, to CrowdStrike, to customers, to partners, to prospects, to the cybersecurity community, and to the market at large. The very best talent builds the very best cybersecurity, and we have ample runway ahead of us to revolutionize, innovate, and, of course, consolidate this year and well into the future. I'll now turn the call over to Burt for our financial updates.\n\nThank you.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nBurt Podbere: Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. Additionally, the results we are reporting today include the acquisition of Flow Security, which closed during the quarter and was de minimis to revenue and ARR. CrowdStrike delivered an exceptional start to the fiscal year, driven by strong execution and increased platform adoption as customers prioritize their cybersecurity budgets around consolidation on the Falcon platform, driving bigger deals and increased wallet share. We have demonstrated a consistent track-record of execution, profitably scaling the business to new heights. In Q1, we achieved net new ARR of $212 million, up 22% year-over-year, bringing ending ARR to $3.65 billion, up 33% over last year.\n\nDemand in the quarter was broad-based across the platform. Our strong win rates remain consistent with the prior quarter and we built a record Q2 pipeline. As George discussed, the Falcon platform's unique ability to consolidate multiple vendors along with the early success of our Falcon Flex program drove bigger consolidation deals in the quarter. Customers are embracing CrowdStrike's platform strategy more than ever as evidenced by the number of deals with eight or more modules, which grew 95% over Q1 of last year. Subscription customers with five, six and seven or more modules grew to 65%, 44% and 28% of subscription customers respectively and the number of deals involving cloud, identity or Falcon next-gen SIEM modules more than doubled year-over-year.\n\nAdditionally, our dollar based gross and net retention rates were consistent with our expectations as we are executing well across landing, retaining and expanding with our customers. Moving to the P&L, total revenue grew 33% over Q1 of last year to reach $921.0 million. Subscription revenue growth accelerated to 34% over Q1 of last year to reach $872.2 million. Professional services revenue was $48.9 million, representing 18% year-over-year growth. The geographic mix of first quarter revenue consisted of approximately 68% from the US and 32% from international geographies. Record total gross margin of 78% increased by 26 basis points year-over-year. Record subscription gross margin of 80% increased 32 basis points over the prior year, driven by investments in data center and workload optimization and a consistent pricing environment.\n\nTotal non-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter were $522.5 million or 57% of revenue compared to 61% of revenue in the prior year. As planned, in Q1, we increased our pace of hiring, growing total headcount by 15% year-over-year as we invest in scaling the business to $10 billion in ending ARR and capture the massive opportunities ahead of us. In the first-quarter, non-GAAP operating income grew 72% year-over-year to reach $198.7 million and operating margin increased by five percentage points year-over-year to reach 22%. We once again delivered GAAP profitability, which grew to $42.8 million, up significantly over Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike grew to $231.7 million or $0.93 on a diluted per share basis.\n\nCash and cash equivalents grew to a record $3.70 billion and free cash flow grew 42% over Q1 of last year to reach a record $322.5 million or 35% of revenue, increasing to achieve a Rule of 68 on a free cash flow basis. Before I move to our outlook, I'd like to provide a few modeling notes. First, we are encouraged by the momentum we see across the business and pleased by our strong execution to start the fiscal year. While the macro environment remains challenging, the unique capabilities and data gravity of the Falcon platform, coupled with our Falcon Flex program are driving larger platform deal sizes, consistently strong win rates, and record levels of pipeline for the year. With that in mind, we continue to maintain a consistent and prudent approach to our outlook and assumptions amid a macro-environment that remains challenging.\n\nWhile we do not specifically guide to net new ARR, our net new ARR year-over-year growth assumptions for the second quarter of the fiscal year are at least double-digits, up to the low-teens. And second, we are maintaining our free cash flow margin target of 31% to 33% of revenue for the full fiscal year 2025 and expect Q1 to Q2 seasonality similar to last year. Moving to our outlook. For the second quarter of FY'25, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $958.3 million to $961.2 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 31%. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $208.3 million to $210.5 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $245.7 million to $247.8 million.\n\nWe expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.98 to $0.99, utilizing a weighted average share count of approximately 250 million shares on a diluted basis. We are raising our guidance for the full fiscal year 2025. We currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3,976.3 million to $4,010.7 million, reflecting a growth rate of 30% to 31% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $890.1 million and $916.5 million. We expect fiscal 2025 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $985.6 million and $1,012 million. Utilizing approximately 251 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $3.93 to $4.03.\n\nGeorge and I will now take your questions.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVIDIA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "When it comes to corporate computer security, 93% of security operations centers within companies still rely on manual, human-led processes, according to Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW). Unfortunately, humans aren't equipped to deal with the high volume of cyberthreats faced by modern organizations, which means 23% of security alerts are left uninvestigated.\n\nThat creates unacceptable vulnerabilities, and artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most powerful solutions to this problem. SentinelOne (NYSE: S) specializes in automated cybersecurity software driven by AI, which reduces the workload on human operators so that fewer incidents slip through.\n\nSentinelOne stock is trading 78% below its all-time high that was set during the 2021 tech frenzy. However, the company has done nothing but grow since then, so here's why it might be a great buying opportunity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA comprehensive AI-based cybersecurity solution\n\nSentinelOne's Singularity platform is a unified cloud, identity, and endpoint security product to fulfill all of an organization's needs. AI powers a suite of unique features on Singularity that can identify, analyze, and rectify incidents autonomously, saving managers copious amounts of time.\n\nIts Storyline tool uses AI to rapidly summarize incidents into reports using natural language, inclusive of context so managers can get up to speed without spending hours on manual investigations. Then, Singularity's One-Click Remediation feature allows managers to instantly reverse unauthorized changes, restoring networks to their pre-breach state.\n\nSentinelOne enhanced Singularity further last year with the release of Purple AI, a chatbot-style assistant that can turn any security analyst into an expert. Using natural language, Purple AI can be prompted to hunt for new and emerging threats, uncover hidden vulnerabilities, and offer more detail about incidents that warrant deeper investigation. In fact, it can speed up some of those workflows by 80%, according to early adopters.\n\nDemand for SentinelOne's cybersecurity services remains strong, especially among large, complex organizations. During the recent fiscal 2025 first quarter, the company had 1,193 customers spending a minimum of $100,000 annually, which was a 30% increase from the year-ago period. Management also said the number of customers spending $1 million annually reached a new record high, although it didn't provide a specific figure.\n\nSentinelOne just delivered positive free cash flow for the first time\n\nSentinelOne generated $186 million in revenue during the first quarter, which was a 40% increase from the same period last year. That was a faster growth rate than two of the company's main rivals in the AI cybersecurity space: CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) boosted its revenue by 33% in its recent quarter, and Palo Alto Networks' revenue rose 15%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth of those competitors are much larger than SentinelOne, so it's harder for them to match its growth rate. However, it's a sign that SentinelOne is taking a small amount of market share.\n\nPlus, SentinelOne achieved an important profitability milestone during Q1. It generated $33.7 million in free cash flow, marking the first positive result in the company's history after years of losses. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP metric that strips out one-off and non-cash expenses like some property purchases and stock-based compensation, so it isn't technically \"true\" profitability, but it's a step in the right direction.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, SentinelOne still lost $70.1 million during Q1, but that narrowed from its $106.9 million net loss in the year-ago period. Fast revenue growth combined with operating costs that only rose 5.1% contributed to the shrinking loss.\n\nWhy SentinelOne stock is a buy now\n\nSentinelOne shares fell 13% after the company released its Q1 report. Despite its strong results, investors were disappointed because the company slightly reduced its full-year revenue forecast for fiscal 2025. It now expects to deliver $811.5 million in revenue compared to previous guidance of $815 million as management weighs the potential for a broader economic slowdown.\n\nSentinelOne stock is down around 78% from its all-time high. To be frank, its valuation was ambitious back in 2021; it traded at an eye-watering price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of more than 100. For context, CrowdStrike currently sports a P/S ratio of 25, and even that's expensive relative to many of its peers (Palo Alto's P/S ratio is 13.4).\n\nBut the decline in SentinelOne's stock price combined with its significant revenue growth since 2021 have brought its P/S ratio down to just 7.4, making it far cheaper than its competitors. CRWD PS Ratio Chart\n\nSentinelOne is checking all of the right boxes for investors. Its revenue is growing quickly, it's attracting high-spending customers, it's making progress toward true profitability, and it's heavily focused on AI innovation, which will make it a go-to cybersecurity provider for the long term. For those reasons, now might be a great time to buy the dip.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SentinelOne right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SentinelOne, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SentinelOne wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.93 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.89 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.57 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.49%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this cloud-based security company would post earnings of $0.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.95, delivering a surprise of 15.85%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nCrowdStrike , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry, posted revenues of $921.04 million for the quarter ended April 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.79%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $692.58 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nCrowdStrike shares have added about 20.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 10.8%.\n\nWhat's Next for CrowdStrike?\n\nWhile CrowdStrike has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for CrowdStrike: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.90 on $956.18 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.90 on $3.97 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Software is currently in the top 27% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nCouchbase, Inc. (BASE), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2024. The results are expected to be released on June 5.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.14 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +48.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nCouchbase, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $48.52 million, up 18.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) Posts Better-Than-Expected Sales In Q1\n\nCybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) announced better-than-expected results in Q1 CY2024, with revenue up 33% year on year to $921 million. The company expects next quarter's revenue to be around $959.8 million, in line with analysts' estimates. It made a non-GAAP profit of $0.93 per share, improving from its profit of $0.57 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Find out in our full research report.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $921 million vs analyst estimates of $904.8 million (1.8% beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $0.93 vs analyst estimates of $0.89 (4.4% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q2 CY2024 is $959.8 million at the midpoint, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting The company lifted its revenue guidance for the full year from $3.96 billion to $3.99 billion at the midpoint, a 0.9% increase Gross Margin (GAAP): 75.6%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow of $322.5 million, up 13.7% from the previous quarter Annual Recurring Revenue: $3.65 billion at quarter end, up 33.5% year on year Market Capitalization: $74.66 billion\n\n\u201cCrowdStrike started the fiscal year from a position of momentum and exceptional strength, with net new ARR of $212 million growing 22% year-over-year and ending ARR growing 33% year-over-year to reach $3.65 billion,\u201d said George Kurtz, CrowdStrike's president, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder.\n\nFounded by George Kurtz, the former CTO of the antivirus company McAfee, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) provides cybersecurity software that protects companies from breaches and helps them detect and respond to cyber attacks.\n\nEndpoint Security\n\nAlmost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks. As the volume of internet enabled devices grows, every device that employees use to connect to business networks represents a potential risk. Endpoint security software enables businesses to protect devices (endpoints) that employees use for work purposes either on a network or in the cloud from cyber threats.\n\nSales Growth\n\nAs you can see below, CrowdStrike's revenue growth has been impressive over the last three years, growing from $302.8 million in Q1 2022 to $921 million this quarter. CrowdStrike Total Revenue\n\nUnsurprisingly, this was another great quarter for CrowdStrike with revenue up 33% year on year. On top of that, its revenue increased $75.7 million quarter on quarter, a very strong improvement from the $59.32 million increase in Q4 CY2023. This is a sign of re-acceleration of growth and great to see.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext quarter's guidance suggests that CrowdStrike is expecting revenue to grow 31.2% year on year to $959.8 million, slowing down from the 36.7% year-on-year increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, analysts covering the company were expecting sales to grow 28.3% over the next 12 months before the earnings results announcement.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\n\nCash Is King\n\nIf you've followed StockStory for a while, you know that we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can't use accounting profits to pay the bills. CrowdStrike's free cash flow came in at $322.5 million in Q1, up 41.8% year on year. CrowdStrike Free Cash Flow\n\nCrowdStrike has generated $1.03 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months, an eye-popping 31.5% of revenue. This robust FCF margin stems from its asset-lite business model, scale advantages, and strong competitive positioning, giving it the option to return capital to shareholders or reinvest in its business while maintaining a healthy cash balance.\n\nKey Takeaways from CrowdStrike's Q1 Results\n\nIt was encouraging to see CrowdStrike narrowly top analysts' revenue and ARR (annual recurring revenue) expectations this quarter, showing customers continue investing in its products. We were also glad it raised its full-year revenue and EPS guidance, which beat Wall Street's projections. Zooming out, we think this was a great quarter, showing that the company is staying on target. The stock is flat after reporting and trades at $305.83 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in CrowdStrike right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

believes the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating its operating performance. CrowdStrike uses the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. CrowdStrike believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as these measures eliminate the effects of certain variables unrelated to CrowdStrike\u2019s overall operating performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nOther companies, including companies in CrowdStrike\u2019s industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of CrowdStrike\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.\n\nInvestors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate CrowdStrike\u2019s business.\n\nNon-GAAP Subscription Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Subscription Gross Margin\n\nCrowdStrike defines non-GAAP subscription gross profit and non-GAAP subscription gross margin as GAAP subscription gross profit and GAAP subscription gross margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets.\n\nNon-GAAP Income from Operations\n\nCrowdStrike defines non-GAAP income from operations as GAAP income (loss) from operations excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets (including purchased patents), acquisition-related expenses (credits), net, mark-to-market adjustments on deferred compensation liabilities, and legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits.\n\nNon-GAAP Net Income Attributable to CrowdStrike\n\nThe company defines non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike as GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets (including purchased patents), acquisition-related expenses (credits), net, amortization of debt issuance costs and discount, mark-to-market adjustments on deferred compensation liabilities, legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits, acquisition-related provision (benefit) for income taxes, losses (gains) and other income from strategic investments, and losses (gains) on deferred compensation assets.\n\nNon-GAAP Net Income per Share Attributable to CrowdStrike Common Stockholders, Diluted\n\nCrowdStrike defines non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders, as non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike divided by the weighted-average shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that CrowdStrike defines as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, capitalized internal-use software and website development costs, and purchases of deferred compensation investments. CrowdStrike monitors free cash flow as one measure of its overall business performance, which enables CrowdStrike to analyze its future performance without the effects of non-cash items and allow CrowdStrike to better understand the cash needs of its business. While CrowdStrike believes that free cash flow is useful in evaluating its business, free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, net cash provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP. The utility of free cash flow as a measure of CrowdStrike\u2019s liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in CrowdStrike\u2019s cash balance for any given period. In addition, other companies, including companies in CrowdStrike's industry, may calculate free cash flow differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison.\n\nExplanation of Operational Measures\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\n\nARR is calculated as the annualized value of CrowdStrike\u2019s customer subscription contracts as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms. To the extent that CrowdStrike is negotiating a renewal with a customer after the expiration of the subscription, CrowdStrike continues to include that revenue in ARR if CrowdStrike is actively in discussion with such an organization for a new subscription or renewal, or until such organization notifies CrowdStrike that it is not renewing its subscription.\n\nMagic Number\n\nMagic Number is calculated by performing the following calculation for the most recent four quarters and taking the average: annualizing the difference between a quarter\u2019s Subscription Revenue and the prior quarter\u2019s Subscription Revenue, and then dividing the resulting number by the previous quarter\u2019s Non-GAAP Sales & Marketing Expense. Magic Number = Average of previous four quarters: ((Quarter Subscription Revenue \u2013 Prior Quarter Subscription Revenue) x 4) / Prior Quarter Non-GAAP Sales & Marketing Expense.\n\nFree Cash Flow Rule of 40\n\nFree cash flow rule of 40 is calculated by taking the current quarter total revenue year over year growth rate percentage and summing it with the current quarter free cash flow margin percentage.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240604686291/en/\n\nContacts\n\nInvestor Relations Contact \r\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\r\nMaria Riley, Vice President of Investor Relations\r\ninvestors@crowdstrike.com \r\n669-721-0742\n\nPress Contact \r\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\r\nJake Schuster, Senior Director, Public Relations & Media Strategy\r\npress@crowdstrike.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Tuesday, as a swathe of weak U.S. economic readings ramped up hopes that the Federal Reserve will have to eventually cut interest rates to support growth.\n\nThis notion brought down Treasury yields and pushed investors into more risk-driven assets, albeit at a staggered pace. Fears of a weakening U.S. economy also limited broader risk appetite.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.1% to 5,309.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.1% to 18,725.75 points by 19:29 ET (23:29 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.1% to 38,840.0 points.\n\nWall Street rises as soft job openings spark rate cut hopes\n\nWall Street indexes rose marginally on Tuesday after data showed job openings in the world\u2019s largest economy fell to a three-year low in April.\n\nThe reading followed weak purchasing managers index data from Monday and a downgraded gross domestic product print from last week.\n\nThe weak labor data also comes just days before key nonfarm payrolls data, which is a key gauge of labor market strength. Beyond inflation, which has so far remained sticky, strength in the labor market is also a major consideration for the Fed in cutting interest rates.\n\nTraders were seen pricing in a 55% chance of a 25 basis point cut in September, up from 52.6% seen a day ago. They also trimmed expectations that the Fed will hold, the CME Fedwatch tool showed.\n\nTraders were also seen slightly increasing bets on a potential rate cut in July, although the broader consensus remained on a hold. The Fed is set to meet next week and is also set to keep rates on hold.\n\nExpectations of eventual interest rate cuts offered some strength to Wall Street, although the prospect of a cooling U.S. economy kept gains limited.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.2% to 5,291.34 points on Tuesday, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.2% to 16,853.74 points. The economically sensitive Dow Jones Industrial Average was an outperformer, rising nearly 0.4 to 16,853.74 points.\n\nHPE, CrowdStrike surge on strong earnings\n\nAmong major aftermarket movers, software consultancy Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) surged nearly 18% after it clocked strong quarterly earnings and presented an optimistic outlook on the back of artificial intelligence demand.\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) rose nearly 7% after it raised its annual guidance following stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures edge higher as cooling labor data boosts rate cut hopes\n\nWall Street stocks end slightly higher as weak jobs data supports rate cut\n\nJudge cuts Bayer $2.25 billion Roundup verdict to $400 million\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has produced generational returns in a short amount of time. The stock has soared by more than 3,000% over the past five years and continues to be a winner on Wall Street.\n\nAnalysts continue to raise their price targets for the AI leader. It\u2019s rated as a\u00a0strong buy with a projected 10% upside from current levels. A stock split has renewed excitement for the stock, but it\u2019s not the only leader available.\n\nSome investors want to emulate Nvidia\u2019s gains and load up on companies with promising prospects. These are some of the top rising stocks to monitor.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHubSpot (HUBS) Hubspot (HUBS) logo displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nHubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) has always generated high revenue growth. The company held true to that trend with 23% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in\u00a0Q1 of 2024. However, the company has also been delivering profitable quarters\u00a0which\u00a0is a pleasant surprise for long-term investors. GAAP net income came to $5.9 million compared to a net loss of $36.6 million in the same period last year.\n\nHubSpot offers customer relationship management tools that help companies communicate with their audiences. The tech firm has several subscription plans available for potential customers. Subscription models allow companies like HubSpot to generate steady revenue from current customers and attract new businesses simultaneously.\u00a0More than $600 million of the company\u2019s $617.4 million in total revenue came from subscriptions.\n\nWhile HubSpot has been on investors\u2019 radars for several years, it\u2019s gained renewed attention thanks to a potential acquisition.\u00a0Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is in talks to buy HubSpot. An acquisition should result in a big payday for investors.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is an educational tech company that helps people learn new languages. The company has also expanded to offer subjects like math and science. It doesn\u2019t have the same returns as Nvidia. Shares are down by 11% year-to-date (YTD) and have gained 36% since its IPO in 2021.\n\nDespite the stock\u2019s performance, Duolingo has several elements of a compelling long-term pick. Revenue increased by 45% YOY in Q1 of 2024 as the company reached 97.6 million monthly active users. MAUs increased by 35% YOY\u00a0while\u00a0daily active users jumped by 54% YOY to reach 31.4 million.\n\nProfit margins continue to surge amid breakout revenue performance. Net income came to $27.0 million in the quarter compared to a net loss of $2.6 million in the same period last year. As people continue to learn new languages, more of them will turn to Duolingo. It\u2019s a top choice that is expanding into additional subjects. Duolingo is building up to a broader appeal instead of only being suitable for people who want to speak multiple languages.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity leader that continues to grow despite challenges in the industry. Revenue increased by 33% YOY to reach $637.4 million in\u00a0Q4 of 2024. The company\u2019s annual recurring revenue is a solid $3.44 billion which is 34% higher compared to the same period last year.\n\nRevenue isn\u2019t the only thing going well for the firm. Net income came to $53.7 million in the quarter compared to a $47.5 million net loss in the same period last year. Rising profits will make the valuation look more promising for long-term investors, but the\u00a0forward P/E ratio currently stands at 81.\n\nAlso, Nvidia had a high valuation for much of its time on the stock market. Some investors believe Nvidia still has an excessive valuation, but it\u2019s harder to make that case due to incredible revenue and earnings growth. Crowdstrike\u2019s valuation will spook some investors. But people who can hold onto the stock for more than a decade may end up with respectable gains.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in CRWD.

The CME Group Fed Watch tool now shows a 65% chance of a cut, up significantly from 46% last week.\n\nThe prospect of lower interest rates boosted bond prices, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rising 1%, on track for its fourth consecutive gain.\n\nThis rally benefited interest-rate sensitive stocks like real estate, which outperformed in the S&P 500.\n\nCommodities took a tumble, with cyclical plays like copper, silver, and crude oil down 3%, 4% and 1.5%, respectively.\n\nOil prices are now down for five straight days, with the WTI trading at about $72 a barrel and heading to the lowest close in four months.\n\nBucking the overall bearish sentiment, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) surged 3%, breaking above $70,000.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day (% Chg) Dow Jones 38,491.46 -0.2% Nasdaq 100 18,541.04 -0.3% S&P 500 5,261.48 -0.4% Russell 2000 2,031.81 -1.4%\n\nUpdated at 12:15 p.m. ET\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro data:\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)\u00a0was 0.5% lower to $525.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Crowdstrike investors face a precarious setup heading into the cybersecurity company\u2019s next earnings report as its sky-high valuation faces off with rapidly souring sentiment for software stocks.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nModi Set to Lose India Majority, Needs Allies to Keep Power Short Sellers in Danger of Extinction After Crushing Stock Gains Mnuchin Chases Wall Street Glory With His War Chest of Foreign Money How Billionaires Bought 70% of Detroit\u2019s Offices and Transformed the City NYSE Fixes Issue That Showed 99% Drops, Triggered Trading Halts\n\nThe firm\u2019s shares have more than doubled over the last year, making them among the best performers on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, even after a spate of disappointing results from software peers sent Crowdstrike tumbling from a record high last week. But its soaring share price has come at a cost: a valuation that makes it more expensive than nearly all of its rivals.\n\n\u201cIf they do have some sort of a negative surprise, it is expensive, so you could easily see a pullback,\u201d said Ivana Delevska, founder and chief investment officer of Spear. She trimmed her position in CrowdStrike ahead of its earnings release and snapped up beaten-down rivals including Zscaler Inc. and Palo Alto Networks Inc.\n\nCrowdstrike\u2019s earnings update after Tuesday\u2019s close comes at a time when industry players are confronting heightened investor scrutiny on the ability of future demand to support rapid growth, and their claims that AI will juice performance. Shares of companies that have been able to demonstrate solid sales pipelines have been rewarded, and those that haven\u2019t have been punished.\n\nZscaler surged the most in a year last week after reporting earnings that beat estimates and boosting its full-year forecast as demand for its platform grows. On the flip side, Cloudflare Inc. slumped after it lowered its sales outlook in late May, while Palo Alto Networks also gave a downbeat forecast, stoking worries about future spending in cybersecurity.\n\nInvestors will be looking for details on the Crowdstrike\u2019s partnership with Amazon.com Inc. The tech giant has bet big on the company, and will replace other defensive tools in its Amazon Web Services cloud-computing business with CrowdStrike\u2019s cyber threat protection and response offerings.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Hamza Fodderwala projects the company\u2019s Charlotte AI chatbot assistant will add about $500 million in annual recurring revenue by 2028. The San Francisco-based company is \u201centering rarified air\u201d and is on track to hit $100 billion in market cap over the next 12 months, he wrote in a note.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost analysts tracked by Bloomberg are similarly bullish on the stock with its average price target sitting about 30% above where shares now trade. Bulls see changes in security spending benefiting the company, with customers turning to all-in-one cybersecurity platforms, modern protection tools and artificial-intelligence offerings.\n\n\u201cSpending on preventing cybercrime is going to grow very fast,\u201d said Irene Tunkel, chief US equity strategist at BCA Research, adding that CrowdStrike\u2019s position in this wave of spending makes it \u201cunsinkable,\u201d akin to giants like Nvidia Corp. and Google parent Alphabet Inc.\n\nThose on the sidelines question the strength of future sales. Wolfe Research analyst Joshua Tilton, who rates the stock hold, sees CrowdStrike\u2019s core endpoint business struggling in the future. Many customers using older software have already switched to new offerings like CrowdStrike\u2019s, he said.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve just run out of runway,\u201d Tilton said.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. shares closed higher for the year on Monday, pushing its market value closer to the $3 trillion level. This is the latest sign of improving investor sentiment toward the iPhone maker.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nIntel Corp.

        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD is set to announce its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on Jun 4. The cybersecurity company is expected to show strong performance, driven by the high demand for its cloud-based security solutions, which is likely to boost its subscription revenues.\n\nSubscription Growth to Aid Q1 Revenues\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s impressive subscription revenue growth is anticipated to be a key contributor to its strong first-quarter performance. With more employees accessing company networks remotely, the need for robust cybersecurity solutions has increased, fueling the demand for CrowdStrike\u2019s offerings. The company\u2019s strong deal pipeline reflects this trend.\n\nThe strength of CrowdStrike\u2019s portfolio, particularly its Falcon platform with 10 cloud modules, is likely to have helped attract new clients in the first quarter. Falcon, the first multi-tenant, cloud-native, AI-driven security solution in the industry, safeguards various environments, including on-premises, cloud-based and virtualized settings, across multiple endpoints like desktops, laptops, servers, virtual machines and IoT devices.\n\nCrowdStrike Price and EPS Surprise CrowdStrike Price and EPS Surprise\n\nCrowdStrike price-eps-surprise | CrowdStrike Quote\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform offers 10 cloud modules through a software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscription model, categorized into three main areas \u2014 Endpoint Security, Security & IT Operations and Threat Intelligence. This broad range of solutions positions CrowdStrike as a one-stop-shop for diverse security needs, giving it a competitive edge over rivals such as Proofpoint, FireEye and F5 Networks, which offer more limited types of solutions.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, a significant portion of CrowdStrike\u2019s subscription customers were adopting multiple cloud modules, with 64% of customers using five or more modules, 43% using six or more and 27% using seven or more. This widespread adoption indicates the value and effectiveness of CrowdStrike\u2019s comprehensive security solutions.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s subscription-based business model is expected to continue driving profitability in the first quarter. This model, which generates recurring revenues and higher margins (more than 70%) compared to hardware-centric models, contributed approximately 94% to the company\u2019s total revenues in the last reported financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Moreover, the non-GAAP gross margin improved by 300 basis points year over year to 78% in the fourth quarter.\n\nOur first-quarter fiscal 2025 estimate for Subscription revenues is pegged at $844.8 million, which indicates a year-over-year improvement of 29.7%. The company\u2019s first-quarter non-GAAP gross margin is anticipated to improve 200 bps year over year to 78%, per our model.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nCrowdStrike currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of CRWD have soared 22.9% year to date (YTD).\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA NVDA, Tyler Technologies TYL and Datadog DDOG, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped on Friday, marking its best session of the year, as investors closed a strong month after the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure met expectations.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow rose 574.84 points, or 1.51%, to 38,686.32, driven by gains in Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), which advanced 7.5% and 2.8%, respectively. The S&P 500 added 0.80% to 5,277.51, while the Nasdaq Composite edged lower by 0.01% to 16,735.02, impacted by declines in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other mega-cap technology stocks.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended five-week win streaks with drops of 0.51% and 1.1%, respectively. The Dow slipped 0.98%, marking its second consecutive week of losses.\n\nDespite the challenging week, May was a positive month for equities, with all major benchmarks recording gains for the sixth time in seven months. The Dow increased by 2.3% in May, while the S&P 500 rose 4.8%. The Nasdaq saw a 6.88% gain marking its best month since November.\n\nLooking ahead to this week, the biggest economic event will be the Friday release of the May jobs data. JPMorgan economists said they expect a small step down from last month, and estimate that nonfarm payrolls increased by 150,000 last month, with the unemployment rate steady at 3.9%.\n\n\u201cIf realized, this pace of growth, although solid on its own, will indicate a gradual cooling in the establishment survey,\u201d economists wrote.\n\n\u201cThe April JOLTS release should also point to modest further cooling in labor demand,\u201d they added.\n\nOther key macro events this week is also the ISM manufacturing PMI, set to be released on Monday.\n\nInvestors await Lululemon, Ciena earnings reports\n\nThe bulk of the Q1 earnings season is over, with only a few companies left to report their financial performance for this period.\n\nThis week, several earnings reports will be in the limelight, most notably those by Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) and Ciena Corp (NYSE:CIEN). Analysts expect Lululemon to report earnings of $2.38 per share, reflecting a 4.4% year-over-year increase, with revenue projected at $2.2 billion, up 10% YoY.\n\nFor Ciena's fiscal Q2 results, which are due after Thursday's close, industry analysts anticipate earnings of 15 cents per share, a decline of 79.7% year-over-year, on revenue of $894.9 million, down 20.8% YoY.\n\nOther noteworthy earnings reports that will come out in the coming days include Bath&Body Works (NYSE:BBWI), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), and Nio (NYSE:NIO), among others.\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nBank of America: \u201cBad news has been good news for equities over the past two months (-78% correlation between the S&P 500 and USD), but if growth deteriorates too much, bad news can turn into bad news. We believe the goldilocks range for NFP is +125-175K, which would maintain the unemployment rate largely unchanged assuming labor supply growth remains at or above today\u2019s level. Sub-125K gains in NFP could increase the risk of triggering the Sahm Rule*, reviving recession fears in the market. As long as inflation remains in check, stronger growth should also be positive for stocks.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs: \u201cCurrently the Magnificent 7 account for 13% of hedge fund long portfolio and 19% of the average large-cap core mutual fund portfolio, both shares roughly flat vs. last quarter (Exhibit 2). For reference, the seven stocks composed 25% of the market cap of the Russell 3000 index at the end of 1Q. At the stock level, hedge funds added to AAPL but trimmed positions on net in GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, MSFT, and META (NASDAQ:META) in 1Q. Furthermore, all of these stocks except TSLA remain at the top of our Hedge Fund VIP list. Mutual funds reduced positions in each of the Magnificent 7 in 1Q, led by MSFT, with 25% of funds in our sample cutting their exposure to the stock.\u201d\n\nJefferies: \u201cUS market remains expensive on both PE and PE/G basis. Broadly, the market is pricing a goldilocks environment, expecting Fed to cut rates while the economy continues to thrive, thus supporting the corporate earnings. Amid the stretched valuations, focus on sustainable earnings becomes even more important.\u201d\n\nRBC Capital Markets: \u201cValuations are already favorable for the broader market ex the top 10 S&P 500 names, so the driver will need to be something else. Our work suggests that the 10-year yield needs to stop rising, the market needs more clarity and certainty around the path of monetary policy and the timing of cuts, earnings trends need improve for the broader market such that they look better than the biggest growth names, and economic excitement needs to return. The trigger for a renewal of the rotation trade may also come from positioning. CFTC data suggests that the large-cap growth trade is no longer frothy. But it also doesn\u2019t look washed out suggesting overbought conditions could return rather quickly to this corner of the market.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFew AI deepfakes identified in EU elections, Microsoft president says\n\nGameStop soars as 'Roaring Kitty' reveals $116 million bet in Reddit post\n\nView comments",

        "content": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) Q1 Earnings Report Preview: What To Look For\n\nCybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) will be announcing earnings results tomorrow afternoon. Here's what investors should know.\n\nCrowdStrike met analysts' revenue expectations last quarter, reporting revenues of $845.3 million, up 32.6% year on year. It was a solid quarter for the company, with the company beating slightly on revenue and ARR but very convincingly on operating profit. Keeping with that theme, while forward guidance for next quarter and the full year were only slightly above expectations, non-GAAP EPS guidance was more convincingly ahead, showing better-than-expected profitability.\n\nIs CrowdStrike a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting CrowdStrike's revenue to grow 30.6% year on year to $904.8 million, slowing from the 42% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.89 per share. CrowdStrike Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. CrowdStrike has a history of exceeding Wall Street's expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years by 2.1% on average.\n\nLooking at CrowdStrike's peers in the cybersecurity segment, some have already reported their Q1 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. SentinelOne delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 39.7%, beating analysts' expectations by 2.9%, and Varonis reported revenues up 6.2%, in line with consensus estimates. SentinelOne traded down 13.4% following the results while Varonis's stock price was unchanged.\n\nRead our full analysis of SentinelOne's results here and Varonis's results here.\n\nValuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 thanks to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and while some of the cybersecurity stocks have fared somewhat better, they have not been spared, with share prices down 5.7% on average over the last month. CrowdStrike's stock price was unchanged during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $399.4 (compared to the current share price of $315).\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "title": "Growth Stocks to Avoid Like the Plague: 3 Overpriced Picks Primed to Plummet",
        "content": "Growth stocks can be millionaire-makers and the same ideas can be destroyers of wealth. The difference between wealth creation and erosion is the timing of exposure.\n\nDuring the pandemic and the subsequent rally for growth stocks, Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) stock traded at highs that was close to $400. It was among the overpriced growth stocks that plunged as markets readjusted growth expectations in a post-pandemic world.\n\nThis is just one example to back my view of being cautious while considering exposure to growth stocks that have already skyrocketed. It\u2019s the fear of missing out that translates into buying stocks that are trading at stretched valuations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere has been ample price-action in growth stocks in the last few quarters. The focus of this column is on ideas that have trended higher and look expensive. These stocks can be avoided at current levels and considered for fresh exposure after a meaningful correction.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere is no doubt on the point that CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a quality name to consider in the cybersecurity business. The company provides cloud-delivered protection of endpoints, cloud workloads, identity and data.\n\nHowever, CRWD stock has surged by 100% in the last 12 months and valuations are stretched. Currently, CRWD stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 80.7. I therefore expect a meaningful downside from current levels before fresh exposure can be considered.\n\nFor the last financial year, CrowdStrike reported diluted earning per share of $3.09. For FY25, the company guided for earnings per share (EPS) of $3.87. This would imply EPS growth of 25% on a year-on-year basis. Therefore, a price-earnings-to-growth ratio of over 3 underscores my view on stretched valuations.\n\nIn terms of positives, CrowdStrike continues to deliver healthy average recurring revenue (ARR). Further, free cash flow (FCF) for FY24 was $938 million and it\u2019s likely to be more than $1 billion for FY25. CrowdStrike therefore has high financial flexibility for platform development. Also, the total addressable market for the company is estimated at $225 billion for 2025. This provides headroom for sustained growth.\n\nAltair Engineering (ALTR) image of a cloud surrounded by various symbols related to internet connectivity and interaction\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAltair Engineering (NASDAQ:ALTR) is a provider of software and cloud solutions for simulation and design, high-performance computing, data analytics, and artificial intelligence. The company is therefore in an attractive business and it\u2019s not surprising that ALTR stock trades near 52-week highs. However, at a forward P/E of 71, the valuations look stretched and I would expect a sharp correction from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Q1 2024, Altair Engineering reported revenue growth of 4.1% on a year-on-year basis to $172.9 million. Clearly, growth has been muted and Altair has guided for full-year revenue growth in the range of 6.4% to 8%. Given the expectations, a 20% to 30% correction seems likely from current levels.\n\nIn terms of positives, The company\u2019s software revenue has continued to increase as a percentage of total revenue. Further, free cash flow for Q1 2024 was $70.7 million. With an annualized FCF potential of nearly $300 million, Altair has high financial flexibility for making aggressive investments in innovation-driven software solutions.\n\nNovavax (NVAX) Novavax (NVAX) vaccine for prevention of coronavirus, Covid-19, Sars-Cov-2 in doctors hands in rubber blue gloves\n\nSource: Vladimka production / Shutterstock.com\n\nNovavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock was trading above $300 in February 2021. The big rally was on the back of Novavax developing a vaccine against Covid-19. However, with Novavax being a laggard in the vaccine race, NVAX stock plunged and was trading below $5.\n\nHowever, in the last month, NVAX stock has surged by 250%. I believe that this rally is a good opportunity to sell the stock with valuations looking overextended.\n\nAn important point to note is that the big rally has been on the back of news related to a partnership with Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY). The two announced a co-exclusive licensing agreement for the Covid-19 vaccine. While the agreement will translate into a cash infusion for Novavax, there are two important points to note.\n\nFirst, the market for Covid-19 vaccines is saturated and it remains to be seen if the long-term impact is positive on growth. Further, Novavax is still building its molecular entity pipeline. With a focus on research and development, it is likely its cash burn will continue. The big rally is therefore a good opportunity to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Often overlooked by institutional investors, certain industry-disrupting stocks are pioneering revolutionary advances and shaking up their industries.\n\nThe current economy is characterized by three defining traits: strength, growth and recovery. This environment makes investing an excellent strategy. Consider these three stocks: CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Fair Issac (NYSE:FICO). You might recognize these names from various contexts, but they\u2019re often underestimated in the investment world. These industry-disrupting stocks present significant growth and profit opportunities, particularly because they haven\u2019t yet garnered widespread attention. Their status as \u201csleepers\u201d means they are prime for early investment. CRWD is an innovator in the cybersecurity industry.

        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Jun 4.\n\nThe company has consistently demonstrated impressive financial performance, underpinned by its subscription-based revenue model. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 18.2%.\n\nFor the first quarter, CrowdStrike projects total revenues between $902.2 million and $905.8 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $904.8 million, which indicates growth of 30.7% from the year-ago quarter's level.\n\nCrowdStrike anticipates non-GAAP earnings between 89 cents and 90 cents per share. The consensus mark for the bottom line has remained unchanged at 89 cents over the past 60 days and indicates a 56.1% year-over-year growth.\n\nCRWD has witnessed a remarkable run with share price soaring 23.7% year to date (YTD) outperforming the Zacks Internet \u2013 Software industry\u2019s growth of 10.6%.\n\nAs CrowdStrike approaches its first-quarter earnings announcement, let\u2019s see if it is the right time to invest in this stock.\n\nCrowdStrike Price and EPS Surprise\n\nCrowdStrike price-eps-surprise | CrowdStrike Quote\n\nPortfolio Strength Helps Add Users\n\nCrowdStrike is a leader in the endpoint security market, known for its Falcon platform that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect and prevent threats in real-time. The company\u2019s continuous innovation, including advancements in extended detection and response capabilities, positions it ahead of competitors.\n\nAs cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated, CrowdStrike\u2019s ability to adapt and evolve its technology provides a significant competitive advantage. Earlier this month, CRWD announced that it has upgraded the Falcon Next-Gen Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) solution, which gives it an edge over traditional SIEM products.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s portfolio strength, mainly in the Falcon platform\u2019s 10 cloud modules, boosts its competitive edge and helps add users. In the last reported results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2024, the company closed more than 250, 490 and 1,900 deals, valued in excess of $1 million, $500,000 and $100,000, respectively. In fiscal 2024, the company added more than 6,000 subscription customers, reaching total customer count to 29,000.\n\nRising demand for cyber security, owing to the slew of data breaches, is a positive for CrowdStrike. Enterprises face continued sophisticated cyber threats, making cyber security a mission-critical, high-profile requirement. CrowdStrike\u2019s rich experience in the security space and continued delivery of mission-critical solutions should help it maintain and grow its market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoing by a Fortune Business Insights report, the worldwide cybersecurity market is projected to grow from $172.32 billion in 2023 to $424.97 billion in 2030, indicating a CAGR of 13.8% during 2023-2030. This projection reflects strong growth opportunity for for CrowdStrike, which has a diversified product portfolio for large and mid-sized organizations to protect their sensitive data.\n\nAcquisitions, Partnerships Aid Prospects\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s acquisitions and partnerships play a crucial role in its growth strategy. In March this year, it agreed to acquire Flow Security, the industry's first and only cloud data runtime security solution.\n\nWith Flow Security\u2019s acquisition, CrowdStrike aims to enhance its cloud security offerings by providing comprehensive, real-time data protection. This acquisition should allow CrowdStrike to offer a unique platform that secures data both at rest and in motion, covering all aspects of endpoint and cloud environments.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s other notable acquisitions over the past couple of years include Bionic, Reposify and SecureCircle. These acquisitions have not only strengthened its data-protection capabilities but also expanded its customer base.\n\nCrowdStrike's strategic partnerships with Amazon\u2019s AMZN cloud division Amazon Web Services (AWS), Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google Cloud, and Cloudflare NET have significantly bolstered its growth prospects. The collaboration with Amazon\u2019s AWS allows for seamless deployment of CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform, offering advanced threat detection and response capabilities.\n\nThe partnership with Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud further strengthens CRWD\u2019s reach and effectiveness. Earlier in May 2024, the two companies expanded their partnership to power Mandiant\u2019s Incident Response and Managed Detection and Response services, leveraging the CrowdStrike Falcon and the Google Cloud Security Operations platforms.\n\nCollaboration with Cloudflare brings additional benefits by combining CRWD\u2019s endpoint protection with Cloudflare's network security solutions. This synergy enhances overall cybersecurity measures, providing comprehensive protection against a wide range of cyber threats.\n\nThese partnerships enable CrowdStrike to deliver integrated, high-performance security solutions, driving customer adoption and reinforcing its position as a leader in the cybersecurity industry.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s strong financial performance, robust demand environment, product expansion, growing customer base, and growth initiatives, including acquisitions and partnerships, make it a compelling investment option ahead of its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report.

        "title": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +4.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which CrowdStrike falls in, has gained 2.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nCrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.89 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.90 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +26.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.80 indicates a change of +22.9% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for CrowdStrike.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRWD _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $904.82 million indicates a year-over-year change of +30.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.97 billion and $4.98 billion estimates indicate +29.8% and +25.7% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $845.34 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +32.6%. EPS of $0.95 for the same period compares with $0.47 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $839.08 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.75%. The EPS surprise was +15.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "1 Supercharged Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Up 500% in 5 Years to Buy Now, According to Wall Street (Hint: Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) sales across hardware, software, and services are forecast to reach $1.8 trillion by 2030, up from $279 billion in 2024, according to Grand View Research. That translates into annual growth of 37% over the next six years. Opportunities of that magnitude come along about once in a decade.\n\nThe last comparable technological transformation was probably the advent of cloud computing. That market is now approaching $1 trillion, and patient investors who bought shares of Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft a decade back have beaten the S&P 500 several times over. AI could be just as lucrative, if not more so.\n\nCrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) lacks the hype surrounding Nvidia, but the company is set to benefit from AI and has already demonstrated its ability to create value for investors. The stock has surged 503% since its public debut in June 2019, and shares more than doubled in the past year alone.\n\nThose returns notwithstanding, 92% of Wall Street analysts who follow CrowdStrike rate the stock as a buy, and the other 8% rate it as a hold. Not a single analyst recommends selling. Here's what investors should know.\n\nCrowdStrike has a strong presence in several cybersecurity markets\n\nCrowdStrike is a leader in endpoint security software, a vertical concerned with protecting devices like servers and desktops. The company is also gaining share in the endpoint market more quickly than its peers, according to a survey from Morgan Stanley. One benefit of leadership in that particular cybersecurity vertical is that enterprises collect most of their threat intelligence from endpoints, so CrowdStrike has robust data to support its artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\nCEO George Kurtz says the CrowdStrike Falcon platform has the \"most effective and accurate AI models to prevent attacks.\" Frost & Sullivan analysts drew a similar conclusion in a report published in 2022: \"CrowdStrike leads the industry with regards to the application of artificial intelligence/machine learning to endpoint security.\"\n\nLeadership in endpoint security has also helped the company expand into other verticals. CrowdStrike is a recognized leader in cloud security, identity threat detection, risk-based vulnerability management, and managed detection and response services. The company also has one of the fastest-growing security information and event management (SIEM) solutions on the market and recently debuted software products for data protection and IT automation.\n\nAdditionally, CrowdStrike is tapping the demand for technology popularized by ChatGPT with its new generative AI assistant, Charlotte AI. The conversational interface helps security teams quickly assess their IT environments, identify threats, and take remedial action. Charlotte AI also recommends ways to proactively reduce risk.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement says Charlotte AI will address a $7 billion opportunity by 2028. Other companies are building similar conversational assistants, but Morgan Stanley analysts believe CrowdStrike is one of the software vendors \"best positioned\" to monetize generative AI, due to its scale and unique data.\n\nCrowdStrike is one of the fastest-growing enterprise software companies\n\nCrowdStrike reported fourth-quarter financial results that beat expectations. Revenue increased 33% to $845 million, and non-GAAP net income more than doubled to reach $0.95 per diluted share. The company also reported a gross retention rate of 98%, meaning it kept almost all of its customers.\n\nCrowdStrike guided for first-quarter revenue and non-GAAP net income growth of 31% and 63%, respectively. Management also said full-year revenue and non-GAAP net income could increase as much as 30% and 32%, respectively. That makes CrowdStrike one of only three publicly traded enterprise software companies to guide for 30%-plus revenue growth this year, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nCrowdStrike shares trade at a reasonable valuation\n\nCyberattacks are becoming more costly and sophisticated. Cloud migration, software adoption, and the proliferation of connected devices create new vulnerabilities, and annual damages inflicted by cybercrime are projected to increase 44% to $13 trillion by 2028.\n\nCybersecurity isn't a discretionary expense but a critical part of the enterprise IT ecosystem. CrowdStrike is well-positioned to capitalize on that opportunity, given its leadership in endpoint security, its growing clout in other cybersecurity verticals, and its lineup of new products, like Charlotte AI.\n\nWall Street analysts expect CrowdStrike to grow sales at 29% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 27.9 times sales seem reasonable. Patient investors should consider buying a small position in this growth stock right now.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Growth stocks are a great way to buy into a potential market bull run this year, should the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cuts occur. The Fed has hinted that rates could go down up to three times in 2024 from 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest in 22 years. The markets are now looking to the next Fed meeting in June for more updates.\n\nIf the Fed does what is expected and earnings keep going up without the economy going into a slump, the stock market could have a broad-based bull market. Fourteen of the 20 biggest stock markets in the world have already notched record highs this year, with U.S. stocks currently on a $12 trillion rise.\n\nSo far, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are leading the charge. After slowing down in 2023, Fidelity thinks earnings growth will pick up again in 2024, helping sustain the bull market with more inclusive stock market gains across sectors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEveryone is buying NVDA stock, but as we shall see, there are solid growth stocks rated a \u201cstrong buy,\u201d have double-digit upsides, and have strong sales growth that are up for grabs. These growth stocks include a top e-commerce play with dominant cloud infrastructure, a cybersecurity firm with advanced security solutions, and an ambitious electric vehicle maker rapidly expanding its model line despite financial instability.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) hit a new record high in May, attributable to Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy\u2019s confidence in Amazon\u2019s abilities in generative AI and good Q1 earnings.\n\nThe upgraded Amazon Q now allows non-developers to build applications using natural language. AMZN also plans to add creative AI technologies to Alexa and charge a monthly subscription. At the same time, AWS Bedrock AI can now import and access custom AI models.\n\nIt\u2019s important that Amazon keep adding to AWS, which accounts for 31% of the global cloud infrastructure market and has a $100 billion annual revenue run rate, more than any other cloud provider. AWS generated 54% of Amazon\u2019s $13.21 billion operational profits in Q4 2023, representing 14% of Amazon\u2019s income.\n\nMoving away from AWS, Amazon has also signed multiple long-term deals with Seattle Kraken hockey games and NBA games to boost its Prime offering.\n\nOverall, on the retail side, Amazon is still getting a big chunk of new spending, and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) experts say that the company is becoming even more competitive.\n\nAccording to the most recent report, the global e-commerce company made almost $576 billion in net sales, up from $514 billion the previous year, primarily from online retail sales; consensus points to a potential 21% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) operates in cybersecurity, an important part of the world economy that will grow by 11% from 2024 to 2028 and reach $273 billion in value by 2028; it holds about a 24% share of the endpoint protection market.\n\nThe CrowdStrike Falcon platform continues to bring in new customers, as shown by the 34% year-over-year growth in yearly ongoing income revealed in the most recent earnings.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s fourth-quarter 2024 earning-per-share was 95 cents, well over the expert expectation of 82 cents, and revenues were $845 million, higher than the $839 million predicted.\n\nOn the product side, CrowdStrike showed off its Falcon Next-Gen SIEM system for the first time at the RSA Conference 2024. CrowdStrike also put out Falcon for Defender, which protects Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Defender setups by constantly looking for risks.\n\nCrowdStrike and Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google Cloud are also working together more closely to improve AI-based hacking incident response and MDR using Falcon and Mandiant. In addition, CrowdStrike and NinjaOne are working together to offer full computer protection.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s revenue for 2024 was around $3 billion, 36% more than in 2023; consensus points to an around 16% upside, enhancing its appeal among growth stocks to buy.\n\nLi Auto (LI) The steering wheel and dashboard inside Li Auto electric car.

LI stock went up because the upscale electric SUV starts at $34,500. The price is relatively affordable within the premium electric SUV market, and the new model received over 10,000 orders within 72 hours of debuting.\n\nHowever, the stock is down 41% because Q1 2024 vehicle sales missed analyst estimates, and its electric SUV launch is delayed until the second half of 2025 due to infrastructure issues.\n\nAnalysts, however, expect a turnaround for the first major China EV startup to turn a profit, projecting an upside of 76%, making it can\u2019t miss among growth stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "Seeking Clues to CrowdStrike (CRWD) Q1 Earnings? A Peek Into Wall Street Projections for Key Metrics",
        "content": "The upcoming report from CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $0.89 per share, indicating an increase of 56.1% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $904.82 million, representing an increase of 30.7% year over year.\n\nOver the last 30 days, there has been no revision in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter. This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe.\n\nPrior to a company's earnings release, it is of utmost importance to factor in any revisions made to the earnings projections. These revisions serve as a critical gauge for predicting potential investor behaviors with respect to the stock. Empirical studies consistently reveal a strong link between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to gauge how the business may have fared during the quarter, examining analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics often helps gain a deeper insight.\n\nIn light of this perspective, let's dive into the average estimates of certain CrowdStrike metrics that are commonly tracked and forecasted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- Subscription' should arrive at $854.96 million. The estimate indicates a change of +31.3% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Revenue- Professional services' to reach $49.61 million. The estimate indicates a change of +19.8% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Geographic Revenue- United States' will reach $615.85 million. The estimate points to a change of +29.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Annual recurring revenue (ARR)' at $3,631,696.00. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $2,730,000.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Non-GAAP subscription gross profit' will likely reach $686.55 million. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported $521.62 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Non-GAAP professional services gross profit' will reach $21.96 million. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $18.91 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'GAAP professional services gross profit' reaching $16.62 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $14.28 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'GAAP subscription gross profit' will reach $670.88 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $509.08 million.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for CrowdStrike here>>>\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike shares have witnessed a change of +18.3% in the past month, in contrast to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% move.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Soar in 2024: Here Are My Top 5 Software Growth Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Unusually high inflation and a rising-interest-rate environment have played critical roles in impacting the macroeconomy over the last couple of years. Yet despite these economic pressures, the stock market has generally shown some signs of strength.\n\nAlthough the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite cratered by 33% in 2022, the index demonstrated key resiliency last year -- surging 43%, thanks to the evolving euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). This momentum has carried over into 2024; the Nasdaq has already returned approximately 13% so far this year.\n\nSince its inception in 1971, the Nasdaq has only produced consecutive years of negative returns on two occasions. The last time it happened was between 2000 and 2002.\n\nGiven the secular tailwinds fueling AI right now, I see further gains on the horizon for the technology sector. Below, I'll break down five stocks operating at the intersection of software and AI and assess why each is a compelling buy for long-term investors.\n\n1. Palantir\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) is an enterprise-software platform that's used by the U.S. Military and its Western allies, as well as large corporations in the private sector. AI-powered software is an intense market dominated by big tech. Nevertheless, Palantir has done a respectable job making a name for itself.\n\nOver the last year, the company resorted to an unorthodox lead generation strategy to market its newest product, the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Specifically, the company has been hosting immersive seminars called \"boot camps\" during which prospective customers can demo the company's software and identify a use case.\n\nThis approach appears to be paying off in spades. For the quarter ended March 31, Palantir grew its customer count 42% year over year. But more importantly, the company is expanding outside of its legacy government contracting business at a rapid pace. Its U.S. commercial customer count rose 69% year over year during the first quarter.\n\nIn addition to accelerating revenue, Palantir's operating margins are also expanding. This is flowing straight to the bottom line, as the company is generating positive net income and free cash flow.\n\nIts price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 21 isn't necessarily dirt cheap, but the chart below helps put things into perspective. Considering Palantir's current P/S is far below prior highs, now could be an interesting time to buy the dip. PLTR PS Ratio Chart\n\n2. Shopify\n\nShopify(NYSE: SHOP) is an e-commerce platform for small and mid-size enterprises (SME), as well as large corporations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe charts below illustrate some important financial metrics for Shopify. Overall, I'd say the company's revenue, margins, and cash flow are all trending in the right direction. However, there are a couple of important items to note. SHOP Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nNamely, Shopify's operating performance has been inconsistent over the last few years. Much of this can be attributed to a botched acquisition of a logistics company called Flexport, as well as a series of layoffs to help reduce costs.\u00a0Moreover, Shopify stock is trading at a noticeable premium when you compare it to a cohort of e-commerce peers. SHOP PS Ratio Chart\n\nShopify represents something of a turnaround story. I suspect that the company will invest aggressively in new products and services, an effort that will take a toll on short-term profits. However, these moves are a compelling strategy to build out a long-term growth narrative.\n\nMoreover, I wouldn't discount Shopify's potential as it relates to AI and fintech more broadly. While the company's valuation may be elevated at the moment, I'd still consider scooping up some shares of Shopify to hold for the long run.\n\n3. ServiceNow\n\nThe next company on my list is ServiceNow(NYSE: NOW), an enterprise software platform for IT management.\n\nWhat makes ServiceNow unique is its ability to cross-sell. Over the last two years, ServiceNow has expanded its number of customers paying at least $1 million per year from 1,405 to 1,933. With a renewal rate of 98%, the company boasts an extremely sticky customer base.\n\nEven better, as of March 31, ServiceNow had $17.7 billion in remaining performance obligations (RPO), representing 27% growth year over year.\u00a0Not only is ServiceNow expanding existing customers and renewing at a high rate, but it's also achieving a high degree of net new business. NOW PS Ratio Chart\n\nWith a P/S of 16.8, ServiceNow looks undervalued, compared to many of its enterprise software-as-a-service peers. Image source: Getty Images\n\n4. Monday.com\n\nMonday.com(NASDAQ: MNDY) builds customer relationship management (CRM) and automation tools for the workplace productivity market -- an opportunity forecast to reach $13 trillion by 2030, according to Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood. While there are many workplace automation software tools available, Monday.com has demonstrated impressive growth.\n\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, the company increased revenue 34% year over year to $217 million. Moreover, net dollar retention was 110%, implying that the company is expanding its existing customers while also generating strong new business. MNDY PS Ratio Chart\n\nSimilar to Shopify, Monday.com trades at a noticeable premium among its peers. The company is generating positive free cash flow, and its operating losses are nearing break-even levels. This has a lot to do with its impressive revenue acceleration -- which management believes will continue.\n\nI think Monday.com's premium is valid and see the stock as a good buy right now.\n\n5. CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) provides cloud-based identity management and endpoint cybersecurity solutions.\n\nCybersecurity is an enormous market with many different use cases. Moreover, the proliferation of AI only adds to new use cases that can help fuel the cybersecurity realm in the long run.

        "title": "CrowdStrike and Cloudflare Announce Expanded Strategic Partnership to Secure Networks and Power the AI-Native SOC",
        "content": "New alliance combines best-of-breed platforms, accelerating partners\u2019 ability to drive vendor consolidation by securing the network and stopping breaches across device endpoints, cloud, identity, data, and applications\n\nAUSTIN, Texas & SAN FRANCISCO, May 30, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD) and Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE: NET), the leading connectivity cloud company, today announced an expansion of their strategic partnership, connecting their platforms to enhance security from the device to the network, accelerate Security Operations Center (SOC) transformation, and stop breaches at scale. Now combining cloud-native, market-leading Zero Trust protection and connectivity from Cloudflare One\u2122 with best-in-class AI-native cybersecurity from CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Next-Gen SIEM on the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae cybersecurity platform, joint channel partners can drive vendor consolidation while reducing cost and operational complexity for customers worldwide.\n\nToday\u2019s adversaries are moving faster than ever across growing threat vectors. Organizations are attempting to manage an array of cybersecurity tools and alerts, and as a result are facing complex, if not already compromised, internal networks. According to Gartner\u00ae, \"The challenge is intensified by the growing arsenal of security tools designed to address individual security threats in isolation. This drives up the complexity of evaluating, managing and integrating these tools as part of a coherent security strategy.\"1 It\u2019s critical for organizations across all sectors to have an AI-powered cybersecurity platform that connects remote users, offices, and data centers to converge data, security, and IT, with workflow automation to stop adversaries from moving laterally and further into systems.\n\nCrowdStrike and Cloudflare are leveraging channel partnerships to deliver a fully integrated solution to global customers from a single API. The powerful combination of cybersecurity from the Falcon platform with Zero Trust protection from Cloudflare delivers the full-scope capabilities SOC teams need to detect and respond to attacks across network, devices, endpoints, cloud, identity, data, and applications.\n\n\"CrowdStrike revolutionized cybersecurity with a modern, AI-native platform focused on stopping the breach. Our ability to execute on this mission and continually innovate across critical areas of enterprise risk is why we\u2019re recognized as cybersecurity\u2019s born in the cloud leader by industry analysts and customers,\" said Daniel Bernard, Chief Business Officer at CrowdStrike. \"The rich dataset from our Falcon platform paired with Cloudflare\u2019s robust Zero Trust capabilities provides unprecedented value for global customers. Together, we are converging two of the most critical pieces of the risk management puzzle that organizations of every size must address in order to combat today\u2019s growing threats.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It\u2019s becoming too complex for enterprises to effectively and efficiently manage risk posture with today\u2019s expanding threat landscape. There is a significant need for organizations to enforce holistic and robust protections across their networks as attack vectors are only growing in size and sophistication,\" said Grant Bourzikas, Chief Security Officer at Cloudflare. \"We have already seen organizations simultaneously adopting both Cloudflare and CrowdStrike; now, this partnership makes it simple for customers to reap the benefits of the industry\u2019s leading cybersecurity providers, to enforce best-of-breed security across organizations.\"\n\nCombining Cloudflare\u2019s connectivity cloud and infrastructure network, one of the largest and most interconnected in the world \u2014 alongside CrowdStrike\u2019s market-leading cybersecurity platform \u2014 organizations can now easily achieve visibility into risk signals and stop breaches.

        "content": "Predicting the future market leaders is essential, given how quickly the technology and finance sectors are developing. Three companies will lead in 2025. By utilizing solid growth strategies, strong financial performance, and creative solutions, these companies are achieving major advancements in application software, consumer finance, and systems software.\n\nThe first one stands out for its remarkable growth in the US commercial category, evidenced by a substantial increase in year-over-year (YoY) revenue and the number of clients. This expansion demonstrates the company\u2019s expanding data analytics solutions, which are highly applicable and in demand across various industries, including aviation and energy.\n\nMeanwhile, the second is using technical advancements and operational efficiency to revolutionize consumer financing. The company\u2019s total cost structure has improved due to considerable sales and marketing expenditure reductions. Finally, leading in cybersecurity, the third one has improved its operating margin. It attained record-free cash flow (FCF) by showcasing an outstanding operational edge. In short, strong market demand and high levels of client satisfaction highlight the company\u2019s significant revenue and annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) had solid top-line growth in the US commercial market. Its revenue rose by 14% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) and 40% YoY to $150 million (Q1 2024). Similarly, the number of clients increased to 262 by 19% QoQ and 69% YoY. The diverse range of sectors in the company\u2019s client base attests to the wide-ranging use of its offerings. The company\u2019s clients include\u00a0major\u00a0energy and infrastructure corporations, international airlines, and the biggest independent bottling company in the US, to name a few.\n\nMoreover, Palantir saw some major client accounts expand quickly. For instance, a Fortune 500 industrial business signed a\u00a0three-year expansion arrangement that increased the annual revenue run rate by a large margin. This pattern draws attention to the happiness and value that current clients get, which encourages new business and increases income. Further, with GAAP net income of $106 million, or a 17% margin, and GAAP income from operations of $81 million, or a 13% margin, Palantir produced its sixth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability.\n\nFinally, in Q1, Palantir demonstrated a sound equilibrium between sales growth and profitability, reflected in its remarkable\u00a0Rule of 40 score of 57%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoFi (SOFI) SoFi logo sign on headquarters facade. Social Finance is an online personal finance company.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nCompared to Q1 2023, SoFi\u2019s (NASDAQ:SOFI) sales and marketing expenditures decreased by 9 percentage points as a proportion of adjusted net revenue (in Q1 2024). This demonstrates increased operational efficiency and leverage. The company focuses on efficiency and cost control, reflected\u00a0in the 16-point YoY drop in total non-interest operating expenditures. The Technology Platform division of SoFi generated $94 million in net sales, a 21% YoY increase. The segment kept its 33% contribution margin despite a sales increase, demonstrating operational stability and effectiveness.\n\nAdditionally, significant advancements in product development were made, demonstrating SoFi\u2019s dedication to innovation and diversity. These advancements included improvements in real-time payments and the introduction of additional financing options. In short, the segment\u2019s growth trajectory\u00a0was aided\u00a0by the pursuit of\u00a0larger, more sustainable revenue prospects made possible by the effective change in sales approach.\n\nLastly, SoFi attained\u00a02.26% cost reductions in the loan segment by lowering its need for outside warehouse finance. Hence, the company\u2019s steady mix of deposit funding and cautious lending procedures allowed it to retain a respectable net interest margin above 5%, which helped maximize margins and increase profitability.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nWith a record\u00a0operating margin of 25%, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) considerably improved its YoY performance by\u00a010\u00a0percentage points (in Q4 fiscal 2024). The boost in operating margin is attributable to CrowdStrike\u2019s cost control and operational effectiveness. The company has demonstrated its capacity to effectively scale its operations by maintaining growth and increasing profitability via process and resource optimization.\n\nSpecifically, with a\u00a0Rule of 66, CrowdStrike earned solid FCF, accounting for 33% of sales. The company has a fundamental capacity to transform its sales into cash sharply. This\u00a0is indicated in the company\u2019s record-FCF creation. Fundamentally, maintaining operations, financing investments in expansion projects, and rewarding shareholders with dividends or share buybacks depend on positive FCF.\n\nFinally, in Q4, CrowdStrike reported a 33% rise in overall revenue, reaching $845.3 million. In addition, the YoY growth in ending ARR to $3.44 billion was 34%. The notable increase in ARR and revenue growth demonstrates CrowdStrike\u2019s capacity to take market share and produce recurring income streams. In short, the company\u2019s top-line growth and its ARR base expansion are driven by the significant demand for its cybersecurity products.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in PLTR and SOFI.

        "content": "If you\u2019re wondering which overvalued blue-chip stocks to ditch right now, look no further. The best investors pay attention to a stock\u2019s valuation. Warren Buffett famously avoids buying stocks that are trading at more than 15 times future earnings estimates. Any stock with a higher multiple is too expensive for the Oracle of Omaha. Buffett\u2019s most recent stock purchase, Swiss insurer Chubb (NYSE:CB), is trading at a price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11 times future earnings forecasts.\n\nWithin the benchmark S&P 500 index, the average P/E ratio is currently just over 27, having risen along with the bull market that began 18 months ago. Stocks are compared to the average multiple to determine whether they are expensive relative to their peers. Some stocks justify a high valuation due to their strong earnings growth and share price appreciation. Others are dangerously overvalued and destined for a correction.\n\nHere is blue-chip bubble trouble: seven stocks to short as valuations stretch to the limit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOvervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) have performed well, rising 120% in the past 12 months, including a 40% gain on the year. In the last five years, CRWD stock has increased 444%. While the share price appreciation has been impressive, the growth has made CrowdStrike a very expensive stock to own. The company\u2019s shares are currently trading at 950 times future earnings estimates.\n\nSome investors might feel the premium valuation is justified as CrowdStrike continues to grow at a brisk clip. CRWD stock rose 23% in one day during March after the company reported fourth quarter 2023 financial results that beat Wall Street estimates and raised its forward guidance. On an earnings call, management reiterated their goal of achieving $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by 2030.\n\nWhile CrowdStrike has been one of the best performing cybersecurity stocks, there\u2019s no denying that the shares are expensive right now. The company next reports earnings on June 4.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nData analytics company Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is also richly valued, trading at 165 times future earnings forecasts. Like CrowdStrike, Palantir stock has been a strong performer, rising 43% in the past year and climbing 26% so far in 2024. However, the valuation on PLTR stock is starting to look stretched with the shares trading at such a high multiple relative to earnings expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Denver, Colorado-based company recently reported EPS of 8 cents, yet its stock is trading at nearly $21 a share. While the company has posted a profit for six consecutive quarters, analysts are raising concerns about the lofty valuation. The high P/E ratio is the main reason why there is a consensus \u201chold\u201d rating on Palantir stock among 12 Wall Street analysts who cover the company.\n\nPalantir builds artificial intelligence (AI) software for governments and corporations, and its stock looks to have gotten caught up in the AI trade this year, pushing up the valuation.\n\nOvervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nAhead of its upcoming 50-for-1 stock split, one of the biggest in market history, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is trading at a lofty valuation for a quick service restaurant chain. Currently, CMG stock is trading at 67 times future earnings forecasts. That compares to a valuation of 21 times earnings estimates for rival McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD). Not only does Chipotle have a high valuation but its share price is out of reach for many investors trading at more than $3,100.\n\nThe stock split is meant to help with the affordability of Chipotle\u2019s shares. However, the valuation is likely to remain rich as investors pay a premium to own the fast-growing restaurant chain that specializes in Mexican cuisine. CMG stock has grown 52% in the last 12 months, bringing its five-year growth rate to 375%. Chipotle has been one of the best-performing stocks to own in the restaurant sector.\n\nWhile CMG stock has been rallying leading up to the stock split on June 26, there could be a selloff after the split is executed. Investors should proceed with caution.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Close up of AMD sign in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nBelieve it or not, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are more expensive currently than archrival Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. AMD stock is trading at a P/E multiple of 247. That compares to 65 times forward earnings estimates for NVDA stock. Of course, Nvidia just reported that its profit rose more than 600% in the first quarter from a year earlier.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has gained the high valuation partly from its own earnings growth, and also because of lofty expectations for the company\u2019s new AI microchips. AMD is seen as the main challenger to Nvidia in the fast-growing market for AI chips and semiconductors, where global demand is exploding. In the last 12 months, the share price of AMD has increased 36%. Through five years, the stock is up 523%.\n\nOvervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: Robinhood Markets (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of online brokerage Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) have exploded over the last year as a bull market in both stocks and cryptocurrencies has investors trading more. In the past 12 months, HOOD stock has gained 127%, outpacing most other equities. The rocketing share price has pushed Robinhood Markets\u2019 P/E ratio sky-high. It\u2019s at a point where Robinhood stock is trading at 141 times future earnings.\n\nThe pricey valuation comes as investors cheer the brokerage and its financial results. On the back of strong trading activity, Robinhood recently reported record first-quarter financial results. The company singled out crypto trading on its platform as being largely responsible for its strong financial results. Cryptocurrency transaction revenue more than tripled in Q1 from a year earlier. In the last month alone, HOOD stock has risen 17%.\n\nEli Lilly And Co. (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nPharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY) has a big catalyst with its weight loss drug Zepbound. Robust sales of the weight loss medication have powered Eli Lilly\u2019s sales and stock to new heights in recent months. In the past year, LLY stock has climbed nearly 90% higher. That brings the stock\u2019s five-year appreciation to almost 600%. The sharp rise in the share price has led to a significant increase in the stock\u2019s valuation.\n\nCurrently, LLY stock is trading at 118 time earnings estimates. That compares to a P/E ratio of less than 10 for rival Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (NYSE:JNJ) stock. Pharmaceutical stocks are known for having low P/E multiples. This begs the question of whether the valuation of Eli Lilly\u2019s stock is justified? Analysts seem to feel it is given that Zepbound is expected to post sales of more than $1 billion in its first year on the market, and it could become the biggest-selling drug of all time.\n\nOvervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO), the leading credit scoring agency in the U.S., has been a consistent, long-term winner for investors. FICO stock has risen 22% this year, 75% over the last 12 months, and 367% in the past five years. The company\u2019s near monopoly on credit scoring services in the U.S. has led to consistently strong earnings growth and a stock that seemingly always rises. But that growth has made Fair Isaac\u2019s stock expensive.\n\nToday, FICO stock is trading at 72 times future earnings estimates. While the Bozeman, Montana-based company has a market capitalization of $34 billion, it is currently trading at a higher multiple than most of the Magnificent 7 mega-cap tech stocks that have market caps above $1 trillion. There\u2019s no question that shareholders pay a premium to own Fair Isaac stock. But the company\u2019s growth and competitive position in the marketplace help account for the rich valuation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA, LLY and FICO.

        "title": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About CrowdStrike (CRWD): Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nCrowdStrike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.17, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.17 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 41 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.8% and 7.3% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CRWD Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRWD\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for CrowdStrike here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying CrowdStrike, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in CRWD?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for CrowdStrike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.90.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for CrowdStrike.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Amazon AMZN is constantly gaining traction on the back of its robust cloud services portfolio.\r\n\r\nThis is evident from the latest five-year agreement between Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) and FWD Group Holdings Limited (\u201cFWD\u201d). The agreement is the extension of the latter\u2019s cloud technology collaboration with AWS.\r\n\r\nThis highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS's innovative cloud products and services.\r\n\r\nPer the agreement, AWS has become the strategic cloud provider of insurance company FWD. In order to support its cloud-first strategy, FWD intends to leverage AWS\u2019s cloud computing capabilities, agility and scalability.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nCustomer Base Expansion\n\nThe latest move of FWD has added strength to AWS\u2019s customer base.\r\n\r\nAWS\u2019s concerted efforts toward bolstering its service offerings are likely to continue driving its customer momentum.\r\n\r\nRecently, NinjaTech AI partnered with AWS to launch its next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using the latter\u2019s machine learning (ML) chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike CRWD extended its strategic partnership with AWS to accelerate cloud security and AI innovation. Notably, CrowdStrike is using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker in order to boost innovation in SIEM transformation, and novel cybersecurity AI use cases. More precisely, CrowdStrike aims to accelerate the development of generative AI capabilities in its Falcon Platform.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Brightcove started using Amazon\u2019s generative AI assistant called Amazon Q Business on AWS internally for real-world use cases applicable to the enterprise, media, and entertainment technology sectors.\r\n\r\nBlackBerry recently unveiled a generative AI-backed cybersecurity advisor called Cylance Assistant, which leverages Amazon Bedrock to enable organizations to enhance their cyber security operations.\r\n\r\nZilch extended its collaboration with AWS to expand the use of the latter\u2019s AI and ML services in order to accelerate sales in the next two years, and improve customer service and lending decisions.\n\nWe believe that AWS\u2019s expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In first-quarter 2024, AWS generated revenues of $25.04 billion (18% of the total sales), which grew 17% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening performance of AWS, which has become the key catalyst of Amazon, will likely instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nAMZN has gained 20.3% year to date.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nWe believe that AWS\u2019s growing global clientele, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nNotably, Amazon accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in first-quarter 2024, per the latest Canalys data.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which accounted for 25% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $26.7 billion in revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2024 (43.2% of the total revenues), up 21% year over year. The business is benefiting from the robust adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 31% year over year.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting the company's cloud position. Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud acquired 10% of the market and reported revenues of $9.6 billion (11.9% of the total revenues), up 28.4% year over year in first-quarter 2024.\n\n(NOTE: This article is being reissued to correct an error.

        "title": "Here's My Top Cybersecurity Stock (and It's Not Even Close)",
        "content": "While artificial intelligence (AI) is attracting investors' attention, there's another massive trend they should be aware of: cybersecurity. Bad actors have never had more tools, and the amount of digital information that can be accessed is also growing. This isn't a trend that's going away, either; companies must ensure they have top-notch security or risk being the target of a cyberattack, which can cost millions and destroy confidence in a company.\n\nAs a result of this new reality, the cybersecurity industry is seeing a massive boom. But with so many cybersecurity companies available to choose from, it's easy to get lost. One company is my clear choice, and it has the potential to become a much larger force in this industry.\n\nCrowdStrike has become a top pick in the cybersecurity space\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) is my top pick in the cybersecurity space for many reasons. First, it's a lightweight cloud-native program. This means it can be easily deployed to all endpoints in a business network quickly and doesn't take much bandwidth. Additionally, CrowdStrike has integrated AI into its product lineup since its launch.\n\nUnlike some companies that use AI as a buzzword, CrowdStrike's platform is built on it. Its primary product in the Falcon platform is endpoint protection. This protects network access points like laptops or cellphones from outside threats, and CrowdStrike utilizes AI to analyze activity to understand if it's normal or a threat. It can terminate access to a company's server without human intervention if it detects a threat.\n\nIt also has its Charlotte AI, a generative AI product. This allows users to automate workflows, accelerate investigation time, and reduce the amount of skill required to become a cybersecurity expert. Based on a customer survey, Charlotte helps save around two hours per day through increased efficiency.\n\nCrowdStrike has a massive product line that has slowly grown over the past few years. Instead of having to piece together cybersecurity solutions from various vendors, CrowdStrike is working toward becoming a one-stop shop for all cybersecurity needs. With products in endpoint protection, cloud security, identity protection, threat intel, and more, CrowdStrike covers many areas.\n\nThis strategy has worked for CrowdStrike, as 64% of customers utilize at least five modules, and 27% utilize at least seven. This shows plenty of room for product expansion among its client base, so upselling existing customers and signing new ones gives CrowdStrike two growth avenues.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike's stock has gotten expensive\n\nSpeaking of growth, CrowdStrike has been delivering excellent growth for some time. In the fourth quarter of fiscal-year 2024 (ending Jan. 31), its annual recurring revenue (ARR) rose 34% year over year to $3.44 billion. Looking forward to FY 2025, CrowdStrike expects revenue growth of 30% to nearly $4 billion. Despite CrowdStrike getting larger, its growth is hardly slowing down, which is a testament to the demand in the cybersecurity industry and CrowdStrike's prowess. Wall Street analysts even believe it can grow revenue at a 27% pace in FY 2026 to over $5 billion.\n\nCrowdStrike is also becoming increasingly profitable each quarter. CRWD Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nSo you've got a company that is an industry leader in a rapidly expanding field and has excellent financials. It seems like a no-brainer buy, right?\n\nInvestors must also consider the price tag of the stock. It's no secret that CrowdStrike is an excellent company, and its stock is priced accordingly. CRWD PS Ratio Chart\n\nA price of 28 times sales is very expensive, which is the primary drawback of CrowdStrike's stock. I'm using the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio because CrowdStrike hasn't reached maximum profitability yet. To translate into the more familiar price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, I'll give CrowdStrike an artificial 30% profit margin -- a great goal for software companies like CrowdStrike.\n\nWith that profit margin, CrowdStrike would have a P/E of 93 at today's prices. If you utilize analysts' FY 2026 revenue projection of $5.03 billion, CrowdStrike would trade at 56 times earnings.\n\nThat's too expensive for many investors' taste, and I wouldn't blame them for not buying at today's prices. However, I'd keep CrowdStrike on your radar, as it's too good of a company to forget about if the stock price drops to more reasonable levels.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "The key to making big in the stock market is spotting multi-year trends early and committing to them for the long haul. Identifying long-term trends isn\u2019t easy, but with machine learning and AI, it\u2019s the unmistakable elephant in the room. These technologies have dominated headlines, taking the stock market to unprecedented heights last year. Hence, betting on machine learning stocks to buy is a no-brainer for any investor looking to take their portfolio to the next level.\n\nWith monstrous gains realized in machine learning stocks last year, many had felt the best days were behind them. However, those concerns are overblown, especially considering the pervasiveness of AI and machine learning across virtually every industry. These technologies will lead to massive productivity and efficiency gains for companies, helping them add tremendous value for their customers and shareholders. Not every machine learning stock is made the same, so it is best to separate the wheat from the chaff.\n\nTop Machine Learning Stocks: CrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a top-tier cybersecurity firm leveraging machine learning to enhance its robust cybersecurity capabilities. Its popular Falcon platform uses machine learning algorithms to detect and respond to threats in real time. Having analyzed a colossal amount of data over the years, the Falcon platform\u2019s machine-learning capabilities have skyrocketed.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nConsequently, CRWD has one of the most successful companies in its niche, with an excellent track record of top-and-bottom-line beats. Moreover, it recently posted another blow-out result in its first-quarter (Q1), with revenues surging $845.4 million, a 33% bump on a year-over-year (YOY) basis, beating estimates by $5.4 million. Additionally, it posted an EPS of 95 cents, beating estimates by 13 cents.\u00a0 Hence, it has all the momentum behind it, with impressive generative AI features that will take its service quality to another level.\n\nIt recently unveiled\u00a0Charlotte AI, the firm\u2019s security analyst, which offers a small glimpse into AI\u2019s pervasive impact on cybersecurity. Additionally, it announced a partnership with Cloud Czar Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Service (AWS) to help with its generative AI endeavors. This machine learning stock is a strong buy.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU)\u00a0is a Chinese tech juggernaut using AI and machine learning to reshape its business. It\u2019s leveraging AI across multiple segments to position itself as a frontrunner in the sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor instance, Baidu\u2019s Ernie large-language model stands out as one of the most advanced in its class, rivaling industry leaders like ChatGPT. The Ernie AI chatbot has north of 200 million users already and is likely to be a growth driver for Baidu. Moreover, you have Baidu\u2019s PaddlePaddle platform, an open-source deep learning framework that supports various AI applications and rivals popular frameworks such as Google\u2019s TensorFlow\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe most promising of its\u00a0AI initiatives is Baidu AI Cloud, which has become a major growth catalyst for its non-online marketing revenue.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a key growth driver for its business in recent quarters, offering pre-trained machine learning models covering multiple diverse sectors.\n\nAnother interesting AI-powered project for Baidu is Apollo, its robust autonomous driving technology, which is\u00a0key to driving its self-driving vehicle initiatives. Additionally, it has plenty of traction following its partnership with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0in deploying robotaxis in China. Needless to say, this venture could become a significant revenue stream for both companies, positioning Baidu as a top secondary-play at the Chinese automotive space.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020.

        "title": "3 Cybersecurity Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "Cybersecurity will be a vital part of the digital economy moving forward. Companies are financially incentivized to use the best security tools to protect their data and systems. Did you know the average breach can cost a company nearly $4.5 million? That's according to an annual study by IBM.\n\nHowever, legacy products like antivirus software often don't do the job anymore. That's where next-generation solutions come into the picture. Investors have a variety of cybersecurity stocks to choose from, but after some due diligence, three emerged as potential long-term winners.\n\nHere are the three cybersecurity stocks you can buy and hold for the next decade.\n\n1. Palo Alto Networks\n\nThe firewall has been critical to security for years, and that's where Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) specializes. A firewall is like the security detail at a party checking the guest list to ensure only the invited people get in. Firewalls monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic, looking for anything that doesn't belong. Palo Alto Networks' firewall security is top-notch; third-party firms like Gartner's prestigious Magic Quadrant rankings have named it a leader in its category.\n\nToday, Palo Alto Networks has over 70,000 active customers and is growing by expanding its product offerings to include additional security categories on two other platforms. That gives the company three platforms: Network Security, Cloud Security, and Security Operations. Currently, just half of the company's customers use two of three platforms, and just 13% use all three, so there are opportunities to cross-sell. PANW Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nPalo Alto is one of the largest security companies, with over $7.5 billion in annual revenue. Earnings have exploded in recent years, and analysts believe profits will continue to grow, averaging 22% annualized for the next three to five years. The company's large customer base and size give it a strong hand as it competes for customers' security budget dollars over the next decade.\n\n2. CrowdStrike Holdings\n\nEndpoint security is one of the focal points of next-generation solutions, and CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) is quickly proving to be a winner in this arena. Endpoint security protects devices on a network (endpoints), such as computers or mobile devices. CrowdStrike uses artificial intelligence (AI) and a cloud-based platform to provide instantaneous and effective protection against potential threats. The platform learns from threat encounters, meaning the product improves as it grows and encounters more threats.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike makes it remarkably easy to cross-sell its product because it sells different products and services as modules. Customers can pick and choose what they want for their needs. CrowdStrike has launched modules over time as it expands into new categories. Today, 27% of CrowdStrike's customers use at least seven modules, and the number of those using at least eight has more than doubled since the end of 2023. CRWD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nA combination of customer growth and cross-selling has fueled tremendous growth; revenue has multiplied from $400 million to $3 billion in just four years. The business has also reached the size where earnings start rocketing higher, which gives the stock a bright outlook for long-term investors. Analysts believe CrowdStrike's earnings will grow by an annual average of 22% over the next three to five years.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nTech giant Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) isn't the first name you think of when discussing cybersecurity growth stocks. It's also not growing as quickly as the others on this list. But what Microsoft does offer is a much higher floor because it's a highly diversified company with leading businesses in several industries. Microsoft Defender's security product is embedded within Windows and Office software.\n\nLooking to sleep well at night with your investments? Look no further. Palo Alto Networks and CrowdStrike are drops in the bucket compared to what Microsoft generates each year. The company has an ironclad balance sheet with a AAA rating, one of only two publicly traded companies with such status. It's also the only company on this list that pays dividends, which Microsoft has raised for over 20 consecutive years. MSFT Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nMicrosoft Defender will never be the focal point for shareholders, but that's OK. The stock can give investors cybersecurity exposure with the bonus of enterprise software, cloud, gaming, and more. Despite its enormous size, Microsoft is still growing. Analysts believe the company will grow earnings by 16% annually for the next three to five years, making Microsoft a jack-of-all-trades investors can confidently hold for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Buying tech stocks on the dip can generate meaningful long-term returns, especially as investors abandon previous favorites. Some tech stocks that grew out of favor in 2022 logged impressive gains the following year.\n\nNot all tech stocks are meant to reclaim their all-time highs, and some investors may have to wait patiently before dips become present for their favorite tech stocks. You may want to keep these investments on your radar when the stock market enters a correction and drags down individual stocks.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is in the middle of a correction that hopefully goes deeper. The stock trades at a 180 P/E ratio, and a further dip can make it more affordable. While the valuation is a bit high, the corporation is doing everything else right.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe educational tech company has a vibrant language learning app that has expanded into additional subjects like music and math. People have been flocking to the app and have been staying active on it. Duolingo reported 31.4 million daily active users and 97.6 million monthly active users in Q1 2024. Those figures represent 54% and 35% year-over-year gains, respectively.\n\nDuolingo also reported solid financials. Revenue increased by 45% year-over-year while net income flipped from a $2.6 million net loss to a $27.0 million profit in one year. Doling\u2019s rising profit margins are a key strength that can support meaningful gains in the years ahead. However, market sentiment and a lofty valuation can result in a more attractive buying opportunity if investors are patient.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background.

Nvidia\u2019s latest earnings report demonstrated why it\u2019s at the top of the AI race.\n\nNvidia can amass the largest market cap among publicly traded corporations. Revenue increased by 262% year-over-year in Q1 FY25, while net income surged by 628% year-over-year. Shares now trade at a 60 P/E ratio and have doubled year-to-date. The stock has also increased by more than 2,700% over the past five years.\n\nThe tech stock has been very popular among Wall Street analysts. It\u2019s rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d with a projected 14% upside. Recent price targets after Nvidia\u2019s earnings blowout suggest the stock can rally by as much as 36% from current levels.

The high valuation makes it due for a correction, but other than that, the corporation is solid.\n\nCrowdstrike stock has more than doubled over the past year, and its financial results indicate why that\u2019s the case. Revenue increased by 33% year-over-year in Q4 FY24. Net income came to $53.7 million compared to a net loss of $47.5 million in the same period last year.\n\nBusinesses need to protect themselves from online hackers.

        "title": "2 Unstoppable Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in June",
        "content": "The benchmark S&P 500 is trading at a record high, driven in part by a strong earnings season for the first quarter of 2024. Nearly 80% of companies so far delivered better results than Wall Street expected, according to FactSet.\n\nEarnings season is currently winding down, but a few prominent companies have yet to report. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) have a strong track record of operational success -- which is why their respective stock prices are at all-time highs -- and they're set to report their latest financial results in June.\n\nHere's why investors might want to buy into both companies next month and hold for the long term.\n\n1. CrowdStrike: Artificial intelligence-powered cybersecurity\n\nCrowdStrike is a leading provider of cybersecurity software. The company recognizes the growing sophistication of modern-day threats, which is why it relies on artificial intelligence (AI) to do most of the heavy lifting when it comes to identifying, preventing, and remediating security risks.\n\nEmployees are the most vulnerable part of any organization because they constantly interact with the outside world through emails, phone calls, and messaging platforms, which is why CrowdStrike says 90% of successful cyberattacks originate at the endpoint (computers and devices). But not every worker is a cybersecurity expert, so they can't be expected to identify threats or rectify incidents. Therefore, AI is playing a critical role in automating those processes in the background.\n\nCrowdStrike's Falcon platform is a holistic solution, with cloud security, identity protection, and exposure management accompanying its industry-leading endpoint security. The company also launched Charlotte AI last year, which is a generative AI chatbot that saves cybersecurity managers two hours per day by accelerating workflows. It can answer questions about an organization's security posture, as well as rapidly summarize incidents, which saves hours' worth of manual investigative work.\n\nCrowdStrike's AI models are trained on more than 2 trillion security events every day, making them among the most sophisticated in the industry.\n\nCrowdStrike delivered a record $3.06 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31), which was a 36% increase from the prior year. The company estimates it will generate up to $3.99 billion in revenue during fiscal 2025, which implies growth could remain above 30% for another year. For context, Palo Alto Networks is one of CrowdStrike's main rivals, and it's on track to grow its annual revenue by just 16% (albeit that company will bring in $8 billion, so it's a much larger operation).\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the longer term, CrowdStrike expects to grow its annual recurring revenue to $10 billion within the next seven years by expanding its product portfolio and the regions in which it operates. Even then, the company will have barely scratched the surface of its addressable market, which it estimates could be worth $225 billion by 2028.\n\nCrowdStrike will kick off fiscal 2025 with the release of its first-quarter results on June 4, and provided the company continues to execute in line with its short- and long-term forecasts, investors could do well to take a long-term position in its stock.\n\n2. Broadcom: A multifaceted AI play\n\nWhen it comes to AI, few companies are as diversely exposed as Broadcom. Originally, it was a semiconductor and electronics company that created products like the optical mouse sensor in the 1990s (which eliminated the need for mouse pads). But that changed in 2016 when Broadcom merged with another semiconductor giant called Avago Technologies, because the enterprise has been on an acquisition spree ever since.\n\nBroadcom bought semiconductor device supplier CA Technologies in 2018, cybersecurity company Symantec in 2019. and cloud software developer VMware in 2023. All told, Broadcom spent nearly $100 billion across the three deals, creating a conglomerate with a multifaceted approach to AI.\n\nOn the semiconductor side, Broadcom makes data center switches (among other things) that regulate how quickly data travels from one point to another. Its Tomahawk 5 switch is one of the fastest in the industry, and when developers are using thousands of graphics processing chips (GPUs) to train AI models, such hardware is very important.\n\nLike many cybersecurity companies, Symantec is embedding AI into its products to drive better outcomes. It partnered with Alphabet's (Google) VertexAI to accelerate its development processes, and a chatbot called SymantecAI is now available to customers.\n\nFinally, VMware allows businesses to create virtual machines, which means AI developers can split data center infrastructure across multiple workloads for maximum efficiency. For example, one user might only need 10% of a server's capacity, so VMware allows multiple users to plug into that same server so it operates at 100%. Efficiency is extremely important given there is a supply shortage of some of the semiconductor industry's best hardware, like Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nBroadcom generated a record $35.8 billion in revenue during fiscal 2023 (ended Oct. 29), which was an 8% increase from 2022. But thanks to the inclusion of VMware's financials, the conglomerate expects its revenue to jump nearly 40% to $50 billion during fiscal 2024.\n\nThe first quarter (ended Feb. 4) was off to a hot start, with 34% top-line growth, and the company is scheduled to release its second-quarter results on June 12. Few stocks can provide investors with exposure to AI in so many different forms as Broadcom, so it could be a great addition to any long-term portfolio.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "The cybersecurity investment theme still stands out now that many potential attackers are harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to compromise systems. Undoubtedly, the leading cybersecurity companies are also making good use of AI. With such a powerful technology that can be used to beef up offense or defense, investors should continue to stick with the market\u2019s top defenders as they look to protect and defend with the full power of AI on their side.\n\nI like to check in with the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:IHAK) to gauge how the cybersecurity market has been doing. IHAK stock has recently been steadily climbing after experiencing a short-lived correction of around 13% earlier this year. Still down around 8% from its peak, I see potential value in the space. Let\u2019s check in with three of my favorite cybersecurity stocks to buy to play the AI-driven theme.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an $84 billion cybersecurity company leading the charge. At writing, CRWD stock is shy of its all-time highs, just shy of $350 per share.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith a remarkably strong first quarter that saw subscription revenues surge 42% to $651.2 million, up from $459.8 billion in the same quarter last year, Crowdstrike certainly seems like the high-momentum cybersecurity stock to own with all the momentum behind it and impressive generative AI features that could further enhance its impressive offerings.\n\nCharlotte AI is the company\u2019s security analyst who may offer a glimpse into the future of cybersecurity in the generative AI age. With its recently announced collaboration with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Service to help with its generative AI endeavors, Crowdstrike stands out as an AI-first company that could quickly outgrow the peer group in the coming years.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is a more intriguing value option in the booming cybersecurity space for investors who don\u2019t like chasing hot stocks near their highs. The company is in a bit of a slump, now down around 22% from its all-time high in the middle of 2023.\n\nThe firm clocked in $1.41 billion in total bookings last year, a slight drop of 6% year over year. Indeed, challenging comparables bear part of the blame. Looking ahead, Fortinet stands to tap into AI to help it keep up with rivals and the growing number of AI-equipped attackers.\n\nThe company has its own IoT generative AI assistant named FortiAI, which includes many capabilities that could help neutralize threats. Perhaps the market is discounting FortiAI\u2019s full potential after a rough quarter that I do not view as the start of a negative trend. At 34.4 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), I actually see FTNT stock as one of the better bargains in cybersecurity today.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) also looks like an intriguing value option after its brutal 30% implosion in February 2024. Undoubtedly, FTNT stock has come back quite a bit in recent months, but it\u2019s still off around 18% from its peak.\n\nJust a few days ago, Fortinet reported a mild earnings beat for its fiscal third quarter. Adjusted profits came in at $1.32, narrowly ahead of the $1.25 estimate. As for the forecast, Palo Alto sees revenue coming in line with expectations in the ballpark of $2.15-2.17 billion.\n\nLike other cybersecurity innovations, Palo Alto is serious about improving its products with AI to help fight \u201cadvanced\u201d cyber threats. Its Precision AI solution aims to \u201cfight AI with AI.\u201d Indeed, clients armed with Precision AI playing chess as potential attackers look to play checkers!\n\nAt 49.5 times forward P/E, PANW stock still seems a bit pricy. Perhaps waiting for a more substantial pullback would be best as the firm looks to stay ahead of AI-augmented hackers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Quote\n\nCustomer Base Expansion\n\nThe latest move of FWD has added strength to AWS\u2019s customer base.\r\n\r\nAWS\u2019s concerted efforts toward bolstering its service offerings are likely to continue driving its customer momentum.\r\n\r\nRecently, NinjaTech AI partnered with AWS to launch its next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using the latter\u2019s machine learning (ML) chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike CRWD extended its strategic partnership with AWS to accelerate cloud security and AI innovation. Notably, CrowdStrike is using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker in order to boost innovation in SIEM transformation, and novel cybersecurity AI use cases. More precisely, CrowdStrike aims to accelerate the development of generative AI capabilities in its Falcon Platform.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Brightcove started using Amazon\u2019s generative AI assistant called Amazon Q Business on AWS internally for real-world use cases applicable to the enterprise, media, and entertainment technology sectors.\r\n\r\nBlackBerry recently unveiled a generative AI-backed cybersecurity advisor called Cylance Assistant, which leverages Amazon Bedrock to enable organizations to enhance their cyber security operations.\r\n\r\nZilch extended its collaboration with AWS to expand the use of the latter\u2019s AI and ML services in order to accelerate sales in the next two years, and improve customer service and lending decisions.\r\nWe believe that AWS\u2019s expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In first-quarter 2024, AWS generated revenues of $25.04 billion (18% of the total sales), which grew 17% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening performance of AWS, which has become the key catalyst of Amazon, will likely instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nAMZN has gained 20.3% year to date.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nWe believe that AWS\u2019s growing global clientele, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nNotably, Amazon accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in first-quarter 2024, per the latest Canalys data.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which accounted for 25% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $26.7 billion in revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2024 (43.2% of the total revenues), up 21% year over year. The business is benefiting from the robust adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 31% year over year.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting the company's cloud position. Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud acquired 10% of the market and reported revenues of $9.6 billion (11.9% of the total revenues), up 28.4% year over year in first-quarter 2024.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "U.S. technology equities continue to be on a tear in the second quarter. The tech-heavy\u00a0Nasdaq Composite has risen by roughly 13% year-to-date.\u00a0If\u00a0macroeconomic indicators exhibit signs of recovery from persistent inflation, U.S. equities could extend their rally.\u00a0In this situation, software stocks are even better poised\u00a0for significant gains. The artificial intelligence craze has influenced tech stocks since early last year and will probably do so for\u00a0the time being. Software firms have scrambled to employ AI technologies in their products and have assured investors of the long-term benefits of artificial intelligence for their respective platforms.\n\nThe software stocks below are involved in various sub-verticals of the space, and their exposure to AI will help their shares surge 5X over the next five years.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) makes the initial entry on this software stocks to buy list. The COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a new era for remote working and a surge in demand for cloud computing services. With a plethora of data flowing through data centers, cloud services have required\u00a0a host of\u00a0new cybersecurity tools. That\u2019s where CrowdStrike comes in. The cybersecurity firm offers a comprehensive suite of solutions for endpoint security and vulnerability management (VM). These technologies help to secure \u201cendpoints,\u201d such as laptops, phones, and desktops, while also deploying threat-detection capabilities to\u00a0ameliorate\u00a0a breach before it becomes severe.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite concerns about the macroeconomic environment, CrowdStrike has continued to increase sales with robust, double-digit growth figures. Similarly, in their Q4 FY2024\u00a0earnings report, CrowdStrike reported annual recurring revenue (ARR) Y/Y growth of 34% to $3.44 billion. The firm\u2019s Falcon platform, which leverages AI to identify and neutralize threats\u00a0as well as\u00a0offers an AI security analyst chatbot named Charlotte AI, will likely gain more traction as demand for AI cybersecurity services increases.\n\nCRWD shares have rallied nearly 40% since the start of the year.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a data analytics firm that has gained traction with\u00a0a number of\u00a0defense industry-related companies over the years. Last year, Palantir reported its first profitable year, generating $209.8 million in net income.\u00a0Better operational efficiencies\u00a0coupled with\u00a0higher demand for AI products helped the platform\u00a0to finally\u00a0reach bottom-line profitability.\u00a0I\u2019ve noted in\u00a0prior articles about Palantir that its AI Platform was most likely a lot of hype.\u00a0Based on Palantir\u2019s trimmed guidance after their Q1 2024 report, that idea seems less far-fetched.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile there may be a lot of AI hype driving Palantir\u2019s shares, it doesn\u2019t mean the data analytics firm\u2019s platform will not gain traction\u00a0in the future. Palantir continues\u00a0to successfully market the AI Platform to prospective users, and with an increasingly diverse base of customers, the platform will gain traction.\u00a0This\u00a0makes Palantir a good long-term bet for investors seeking compelling returns in the next five years.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the holding company for tech heavy-weight Google. From providing a globally successful search engine and mobile operating system to providing cloud computing and AI services, Google is\u00a0really\u00a0setting itself up for continued success. The tech giant\u2019s trading valuation multiple is only icing on the cake. GOOG trades at about 22.9x forward earnings, while the plurality of its competitors- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) \u2013 are trading at relative premiums.\n\nIn the company\u2019s\u00a0Q1 2024 earnings report, Google Cloud solidified itself as\u00a0the company\u2019s\u00a0profit growth engine, despite investors having\u00a0held\u00a0doubts about the platform\u2019s long-term viability.\u00a0Operating income for the cloud business segment came in at $900 million in Q1, increasing 3.7x\u00a0on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe tech giant\u2019s foray into AI could\u00a0help\u00a0boost Google Cloud\u2019s sales growth and profitability in the long term.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either\u00a0directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "Machine learning stocks are gaining traction as the interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning soars, especially after the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI. This technology has given us a glimpse of its potential, sparking curiosity about its future applications, and has led to my list of machine learning stocks to buy.\n\nMachine learning stocks present a promising opportunity for growth, with the potential to create significant wealth. As per analyst forecasts, I think around a decade from now is when we will see these companies go parabolic and reach their full growth potential.\n\nThese companies leverage machine learning for various applications, including diagnosing life-threatening diseases, preventing credit card fraud, developing chatbots and exploring advanced tech like artificial general intelligence. The future will only get better from here.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for machine learning stocks to buy with substantial upside potential, keep reading to discover three top picks.\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) DraftKings (DKNG) logo on a phone\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nDraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) leverages machine learning to enhance its online sports betting and gambling platform. The company has shown significant growth, with recent revenue increases and expansion in legalized betting markets.\n\nDKNG has significantly revised its revenue outlook for 2024 upwards, expecting it to be between $4.65 billion and $4.9 billion, marking an anticipated year-over-year growth of 27% to 34%. This adjustment reflects higher projections compared to their earlier forecast ranging from $4.50 billion to $4.80 billion. Additionally, the company has increased its adjusted EBITDA forecast for 2024, now ranging from $410 million to $510 million, up from the previous estimate of $350 million to $450 million.\n\nDraftKings has also announced plans to acquire the gambling company Jackpocket for $750 million in a cash-and-stock deal. This acquisition is expected to further enhance DraftKings\u2019 market presence and capabilities in online betting.\n\nI covered DKNG before, and I still think it\u2019s one of the best meme stocks that investors can get behind. The company\u2019s stock price has risen 72.64% over the past year, and it seems there\u2019s still plenty of fuel left in the tank to surge higher.\n\nCloudflare (NET) Exterior view of Cloudflare headquarters. NET stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) provides a cloud platform that offers a range of network services to businesses worldwide. The company uses machine learning to enhance its cybersecurity solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nCloudflare has outlined a robust strategy for 2024, focusing on advancing its cybersecurity solutions and expanding its network services. The company expects to generate total revenue between $1.648 billion and $1.652 billion for the year. This revenue forecast reflects a significant increase in their operational scale.\n\nNET is another stock that is leveraging machine learning to its full advantage. I\u2019ve been bullish on this company for some time and continue to be so. Notably, Cloudflare is expanding its deployment of inference-tuned graphic processing units (GPUs) across its global network. By the end of 2024, these GPUs will be deployed in nearly every city within Cloudflare\u2019s network.\r\n\r\nNET has been silently integrating many parts of its network within the internet\u2019s fabric for millions of users, such as through its DNS service, Cloudflare WARP; reverse proxy for website owners; and much more. Around 30% of the 10,000 most popular websites globally use Cloudflare. Many of NET\u2019s services can be accessed free of charge.\n\nIt is following a classic tech stock strategy of expanding its users, influence and reach over reaching immediate profits, and its financials have slowly scaled with this performance.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leading cybersecurity company that uses machine learning to detect and prevent cyber threats.\n\nIn its latest quarterly report on Mar. 5, CRWD reported a 102% earnings growth to 95 cents per share and a 33% revenue increase to $845.3 million. Analysts expect a 57% earnings growth to 89 cents per share in the next report and a 27% EPS increase for the full fiscal year ending in January.\n\nAdding to the bull case for CRWD is that it has has partnered with Google Cloud by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) to enhance AI-native cybersecurity solutions, positioning itself strongly against competitors like Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW).\n\nMany contributors here at Investorplace have identified CRWD as one of the best cybersecurity stocks for investors to buy, and I am in agreement here. Its aggressive EPS growth and stock price appreciation (140.04% over the past year), make it a very attractive pick for long-term investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Most Magnificent Seven stocks are tech companies, and this cohort has been carrying the stock market for many years.\n\nHowever, some tech stocks are more likely to outperform the stock market than others. Investors can review financials, competitive opportunities and moats to determine if a certain tech stock has a long-term edge. These are three top tech stocks to buy that can lead to positive returns.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is an educational tech company that helps people learn new languages and other subjects. The app has monthly subscriptions and regularly reports excellent revenue and user growth rates.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe firm didn\u2019t disappoint investors with its\u00a0Q1 2024 print. Revenue increased by 45% year-over-year,\u00a0while\u00a0monthly active users grew by 35% year-over-year to reach 97.6 million users. Daily active users were up by 54% year-over-year and reached 31.4 million.\n\nA high valuation is the stock\u2019s only shortcoming, but the valuation should get smoothed out in a few years. Duolingo is reporting exceptional net income growth and rising profit margins, suggesting a reasonable valuation is on the way. Duolingo reported $27.0 million in net income for the quarter compared to a net loss of $2.6 million in the same period last year.\n\nDuolingo is in the middle of a sharp correction. It\u2019s been a roller coaster for current investors, but the stock looks promising in the long run.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

It\u2019s up 22% year-to-date and has doubled over the past five years. The tech conglomerate is approaching a $2 trillion market cap and trades at a 41-forward P/E ratio.\n\nAmazon has a leading position in e-commerce and cloud computing. Those two segments powered up the company\u2019s\u00a0Q1 2024 results. Revenue increased by 13% year-over-year to reach $143.3 billion. Amazon Web Services reported 17% year-over-year revenue growth, accelerating from the previous quarter.

Hacking is a lucrative industry that can damage any company, especially a small business that doesn\u2019t have as many resources to fight back.\n\nAnalysts believe Crowdstirke can\u00a0gain an additional 14% from current levels. Accordingly, it is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d The stock has been on an incredible run. It\u2019s up 42% year-to-date and has surged by 445% over the past five years. Crowdstrike\u2019s 33% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 FY24 and significant shift to profitability indicate that the stock can continue to rally.

        "title": "Google Parent Alphabet Is Selling Shares of 2 Hypergrowth Stocks and Piling Into a Promising Artificial Intelligence (AI) Company",
        "content": "Once every quarter, institutional money managers with more than $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides an under-the-hood look at what Wall Street's brightest investment minds have been buying and selling in the latest quarter. However, 13Fs aren't just limited to traditional fund managers.\n\nSome of Wall Street's largest and most-influential companies also invest their capital in businesses they believe can change the world -- or at the very least that can make their company and shareholders richer. The nearly $379 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway serves as a good example. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nOne such company that isn't afraid to put its capital to work in game-changing investment ideas is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, streaming site YouTube, and globally dominant internet search engine Google. Google has accounted for at least a 90% share of worldwide monthly internet search dating back more than nine years.\n\nBased on Alphabet's latest 13F filing, it had more than $2.5 billion invested across 43 companies in the technology, healthcare, and financial sectors. What's of particular interest is that Alphabet pared down its holdings in two of its largest hypergrowth companies, while absolutely piling into a rising superstar in the artificial intelligence (AI) arena.\n\nAlphabet reduces its stake in CrowdStrike Holdings by a third\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of Alphabet's investment chess moves during the March-ended quarter is that it reduced its stake in cybersecurity specialist CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) by exactly one third (it sold 427,894 shares). Whereas CrowdStrike comprised more than 15% of invested assets at the end of 2023, it now accounts for just shy of 11% of Alphabet's investments.\n\nThe logical reason for this selling activity is very likely valuation. Even factoring in CrowdStrike's annual sales growth rate of nearly 30%, the company is valued at close to 17 times forecast revenue for next year, and trades at more than 70 times forward-year consensus earnings. Considering that the stock market is historically pricey at the moment, any correction could hit companies with high valuation premiums, like CrowdStrike, the hardest.\n\nBut beyond valuation, there's no reason to sell this cream-of-the-crop cybersecurity solutions provider.\n\nCrowdStrike's superior growth rate is all thanks to Falcon, which is its AI and machine learning-driven security platform. Falcon oversees trillions of events each week, which continually make it smarter and more adept at identifying and stopping potential threats to end users.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough pretty much every key performance indicator for CrowdStrike is moving in the right direction, add-on sales tell the story best. CrowdStrike offers 27 cloud modules on its Falcon platform, and 64% of its clients have purchased at least five of these cloud-module subscriptions. Thanks to existing clients continually upping their spending, CrowdStrike's adjusted subscription gross margin reached 80% in its latest quarter.\n\nLastly, don't forget that CrowdStrike and Alphabet's Google Cloud have an existing strategic partnership in place. Though Alphabet is a seller of CrowdStrike stock, the two companies continue to work together.\n\nAlphabet more than halved its position in DexCom\n\nThe other big surprise found in Alphabet's 13F is that it sold a little over 51% of its prior stake (1,891,112 shares sold) in medical-device company DexCom(NASDAQ: DXCM). Though DexCom was Alphabet's largest investment holding at the end of 2023, comprising 21.2% of invested assets, it's now fallen to third in the pecking order at 9.9% of invested assets.\n\nSimilar to CrowdStrike, valuation might have been the impetus that had Alphabet's investment team pressing the sell button. Despite sustained annual sales growth of near 20%, this maker of continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs) is valued at 10 times consensus sales for 2025 and roughly 58 times forward-year earnings per share (EPS).\n\nFurthermore, there have concerns that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist drugs could adversely affect the need for CGMs. However, DexCom has alleviated these concerns by pointing to studies that show GLP-1 users are more likely to use their CGMs.\n\nThe biggest factor working in DexCom's favor is time. Between 2000 and 2021, the number of people worldwide with diabetes more than tripled to 537 million. By 2045, IDF Diabetes Atlas predicts 783 million people globally will be diabetic. The addressable market for CGMs keeps expanding, which gives DexCom a seemingly unlimited double-digit growth runway.\n\nInnovation has played a key role in DexCom's success, too. The company has developed multiple generations of CGMs, and made regular improvements to its devices that allow for wireless readings and the seamless sharing of vital data with primary-care physicians.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet's life sciences division (known as Verily) and DexCom have been partners for nine years. This collaborative partnership is unlikely to end anytime soon. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe parent of Google makes GitLab its largest position\n\nWith DexCom removed from its pedestal as Alphabet's largest holding, and CrowdStrike staying put in the No. 2 slot, it's development, security, and operations (DevSecOps) software developer GitLab(NASDAQ: GTLB) that's now taken the crown in Alphabet's more than $2.5 billion investment portfolio. Alphabet purchased over 7.11 million shares of GitLab in the March-ended quarter, which increased its previous stake in the company by about 269%!\n\nGitLab's DevSecOps platform helps businesses throughout the software development lifecycle. The key aspect of GitLab's platform is the automated integration of security throughout this development and implementation process.\n\nWhat might be particularly attractive for Alphabet is the role artificial intelligence could play in growing GitLab's top-and-bottom line. A perfect example being the introduction of AI capabilities within GitLab Duo Pro. These features include coding suggestions, which can be particularly useful for large language models, as well as Duo Chat, which can generate and process text to identity useful information.\n\nFrom an operating standpoint, GitLab appears to be firing on all cylinders. The company is profitable on an adjusted basis and generating positive free cash flow. Further, Wall Street is forecasting sales growth of at least 25% in the current and upcoming year, which is to be expected with a dollar-based net retention rate of 130%. This figure shows that existing clients are spending 30% more on a year-over-year basis with GitLab.\n\nThe keep with the common theme of this list, Alphabet's Google Cloud has an ongoing partnership with GitLab. The latter is providing AI-driven solutions that allow Google Cloud to more quickly and securely roll out solutions to its customers.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Despite concerns surrounding rising government debt, there are optimistic indicators for the future of the U.S. economy. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the importance of addressing structural deficits promptly, indicating a proactive approach to fiscal responsibility. While the debt-to-GDP ratio is at a historic high, the U.S. has historically thrived in relative prosperity, suggesting resilience amid challenges. Additionally, bipartisan acknowledgment of the issue indicates a potential for concerted efforts to manage fiscal imbalances. The U.S. economy can navigate the current budgetary landscape toward sustainable growth and stability.\n\nWith this confidence in economic performance, you will be scoring deals. But you need to make the right choice regarding which companies offer the best deals for profitability. Here, I uncover your top three options, from well-known blue chips to growth titans. You will find the best companies below.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSynopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is an electronic design automation company specializing in silicon intellectual properties, software security design and quality. It is valued around $572, up 40% year over year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSNPS\u2019s revenue is $6.1 billion, up 18.5% from last year and 463% more than the sector median of 3.29%. Trailing gross profit margin was 81%, 65% more than the sector median of 48.79%. Trailing EBIT margin was 23%, 419% more than the sector median of 4.43%. These metrics portray Synopsys\u2019s short- and long-term growth prospects and immense profitability.\n\nSNPS is in the electronic design automation industry, valued at $17.72 billion as of 2024 and projected to reach $26.59 billion in 2029, representing a CAGR of 8.46%. Key prospects for this growth include digitalization and technological advancements in the field.\n\nAs of May 2, Synopsys and Samsung Electronics have successfully collaborated to craft a high-performance mobile central processing unit (CPU). This marks a long-term partnership and gives SNPS credibility while aiding in a breakthrough. SNPS should win similar deals in the future as it has proved its capability and credibility. Therefore I give it a \u201cBuy\u201d rating. This stock is already performing exceptionally well and its price will only increase with further deals.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) GOOG stock: letters spelling out google\n\nSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) offers a range of services under its brand name, including software-as-a-service (SaaS) products like Search, AdSense, YouTube, Cloud, and Workspace. Additionally, the company is expanding into artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing.\n\nStory continues\n\nGOOG consistently exceeds earnings estimates, demonstrating rising profitability and revenue, making it a reliable investment. Year-over-year (YOY) revenue has grown by 15.40%, while YoY earnings have grown by 57.20%. Analysts predict an average growth potential of around 4.06%. A profit margin of 25.90%, an operating margin of 32.52%, and a return on equity of 29.76% show management\u2019s efficiency. Additionally, Yahoo Finance! is giving GOOG stock a rating of \u201cbuy,\u201d which is consistent with other stock recommendation services.\n\nThe technology sector has a projected compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.75%, reaching $11.47 trillion in 2026. Rapid industry-wide growth coupled with excellent financials put GOOG in a great position. Recently, it posted a cash flow growth of 16.7% YoY. GOOG has also announced plans for post-quantum cryptography and has started to encrypt data using quantum-safe algorithms. This shows Google\u2019s innovative stance.\n\nRapid growth in the technology sector, where GOOG is innovating, suggests revenue will continue to climb. Excellent financials also provide decent padding for the company, allowing it to invest more in research and development, leading to more significant future growth.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cyber security technology company that provides threat intelligence, cyber attack response and many other services. It is valued at $320.76, a 139.73% increase year over year.\n\nCRWD\u2019s revenue was $3.1 billion as of January 2024, a revenue growth YoY of 36.33%, 1,009.49% more than the sector median of 3.27%.

EPS Diluted Growth YoY was 47.12%, incrementally more significant than the sector average of 6.59% and, when compared, 614.67% larger. These financials portray CRWD\u2019s short- and long-term success and speedy momentum, showing this stock\u2019s profitability.\n\nThe global cyber security market was valued at $182.84 billion as of 2024 and is projected to reach $314.28 billion in 2029, representing a CAGR of 11.44%. Key prospects for this immense growth involve digitalization and the increase and evolution of hacking techniques.\n\nCrowdstrike has announced an upgrade on its Falcon Next-Generation SIEM Solution with features including improvements in speed, data visualization and monitoring performance. This innovation makes Crowdstrike\u2019s suite of products superior to other SIEM solutions. As a result, sales and customers should rise. CRWD is a software stock with a massive upside, prompting me to give it a \u201cBuy\u201d rating with complete confidence that its stock price will appreciate soon.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

A single cyber hack\u00a0can cost a small business millions of dollars. Cyber attacks could drain large corporations even more as hackers can temporarily shut down their operations. There\u2019s also the reputation damage associated with a hack and the winding road of regaining the trust of their customers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) helps keep hackers away from your data and sensitive files. The company\u2019s Falcon Platform can detect threats before they become serious. And, it offers the necessary tools and resources to fortify your digital defenses.\n\nThe company has a valuable place in the cybersecurity industry. Many businesses use it to keep themselves protected. But what about investors? It turns out that Crowdstrike has delivered solid long-term returns for its investors. The stock is up by 40% year-to-date (YTD) and has rallied by 439% over the past five years.\n\nThe firm generated $53.7 million in GAAP income compared to a net loss last year.\u00a0Impressively, Q4 of 2024\u00a0revenue grew by 33% year-over-year (YOY) and the company\u2019s annual recurring revenue came to $3.44 billion.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is winning over more investors as it cuts down on costs while delivering good revenue growth. The tech conglomerate reported 15% YOY revenue growth in\u00a0Q1\u00a0of 2024\u00a0along with 57% YOY net income growth. Alphabet stock is up by 27% YTD and has more than tripled over the past five years. Currently, it trades at a 28 P/E ratio.\n\nAdvertising is the company\u2019s main revenue growth engine. But the corporation is also making steady gains in cloud computing. Google Cloud revenue jumped from $7.45 billion to $9.57 billion YOY. Cloud computing now represents more than 105 of the company\u2019s total revenue. Also, operating income is soaring for this segment, rising from $191 million to $900 million in a single year.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the company\u2019s ability to cut costs and grow its financials prompted a dividend. Alphabet\u2019s quarterly dividend starts at $0.20 per share, but investors should expect a double-digit compounded annual growth rate for several years.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn addition, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been performing well. The stock is up by 23% YTD and has more than doubled over the past five years. The corporate giant has been cutting costs and delivering high-growth opportunities in numerous industries.\n\nMost of Amazon\u2019s revenue comes from its online marketplace. Millions of consumers buy products on Amazon. Reasons for this include its wide selection, fast shipping and the convenience of buying products without leaving your home.\n\nThe recent\u00a0Q1 of 2024 earnings results\u00a0demonstrate the business model is still working well. Net sales increased by 13% YOY with double-digit growth rates in domestic and international markets. Amazon Web Services (AWS) accelerated in the quarter with 17% YOY revenue growth. Artificial intelligence (AI) can help cloud sales accelerate for several quarters. And, net income came to $10.4 billion in the quarter compared to $3.2 billion in the same period last year.\n\nAmazon has exposure to advertising, groceries, streaming and other high-potential business models that should continue to grow for several years.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in GOOG and AMZN.

        "content": "U.S. equities appear to be back on the rise in May. After suffering significant losses in the month of April, both the S&P500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite have more than recovered. In fact, the Nasdaq has risen 11.24% as of the end of Friday\u2019s trading session. Leading the rise of U.S.-listed stocks has largely been technology companies. Everything from the rise of cloud computing to advanced generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have boosted share prices.\n\nTech giants, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet\u2018s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google have become trillion-dollar companies in terms of their stock market capitalization. Over the next decade, several mega-cap tech stocks are well on their way to reaching $1 trillion. Below are three of them.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), which boasts an $84 billion market cap, has become a dominant force within the cloud-based cybersecurity space. Embedding artificial intelligence technology into its vulnerability management (VM) tools has only increased the value of its products. CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon end-point security platform had its debut way back in 2013 and always employed machine learning techniques to identify threats across an enterprise\u2019s technology apparatus. The release of advanced AI models has allowed the platform to be a one-stop solution for end-point security.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCloud-based cybersecurity has increased in demand over the past decade. The rise of cloud computing technology placed tons of enterprise data and applications on cloud servers. In a multitude of manners, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated demand for cloud products, as many businesses went remote and adopted online tools powered by cloud technology. With companies storing much of their data in distant servers versus on their own premises, cybersecurity has become increasingly important.\n\nNot to mention, the cybersecurity space is succumbing to increased consolidation. A lot of these smaller cybersecurity players have lost out to other larger players, including CrowdStrike. For evidence, one just needs to observe the robust double-digit growth rates of CrowdStrike\u2019s sales figures versus the plummeting rates of similar VM platforms like Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS), Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD), or Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS).\n\nCrowdStrike shares have risen 35.5% on a year-to-date-basis and could very well continue their rise as the platform dominates its respective space.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a key semiconductor computer processor giant. Consumer technology enthusiasts know AMD for their competitively priced and quality central porcessing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). The chipmaker was able knock Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) off its feet due to adopting a fabless model of producing silicon chips. That is, rather than being bogged down on the manufacturing side of chipmaking like Intel, AMD outsourced that to the very capable Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). It effectively allows it to focus on chip design and efficiency.\n\nAMD next momentous rise will be in the space of AI chips. The semiconductor firm announced an array of new GPUs that would empower the creation of large language models (LLMs) in June 2023 and followed that up with subsequent releases in December. Of course, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates the AI chip space currently but as AMD enters the market and acquires market share, not only will AMD increase sales and net income growth, but its market capitalization could skyrocket.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing makes the final entry on this list. This Taiwan-based contract chip manufacturer has a market capitalization of $672 billion and is poised to rise even further. The chip manufacturer dominates in terms of manufacturing capabilities and capacity. To make silicon chips more efficient from generation to generation, it\u2019s always been about fitting more transistors on a smaller node size. TSM has been able to successfully manufacture chips at a 3-nanometer node size. It is the most advanced in the industry at this point.\n\nBecause of TSM\u2019s prowess, companies like Apple, Nvidia, and AMD have leveraged its capabilities to construct their advanced chips. What will make TSM a $1 trillion company is the demand for AI chips. In their first-quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2024, TSM handily beat both revenue and earnings estimates. The reason was the sizable demand for advanced AI chips that has been all the craze over the past 12 months.\n\nRiding off of this demand and its successful manufacturing competencies, TSM is probably the most likely on this list to become the next Apple, Amazon or Google in terms of market cap.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "As more of the world\u2019s technology moves online, the demand for cybersecurity stocks to buy will continue to increase. Seen in nearly every major part of any tech company\u2019s operational expenditures, it\u2019s no wonder its market is currently valued at over $200 billion and set to continue increasing at a near 10% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Used by cloud computing services, B2B software companies and AI companies, cybersecurity has become a necessity to provide stability and customer satisfaction.\n\nDespite cybersecurity\u2019s importance, it is a relatively small sector compared to other technologies. Thus, identifying the growing winners in such an emerging industry can easily be a winning strategy for savvy investors. Here are three cybersecurity stocks to buy now for a massive run in 2025. Who knows, maybe these companies will put you into the million-dollar club as well!\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an American cybersecurity company that has been a trailblazer for integrating AI into its security services. The stock has already returned 40% this year, and analysts still remain bullish. Wall Street currently has an average price target of $399.03 and a high-end target of $540. At these targets, that would represent a 15% and 60% upside from the stock\u2019s current price!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis company has done an excellent job in uniquely approaching cybersecurity. It has created a single mesh network that allows all users to benefit from any threats, no matter who receives them. This creates an efficient and scalable platform, called Falcon, to identify and neutralize threats without any human intervention. This innovative and resilient business model is evidenced by a 34% year-over-year increase in its Annual Recurring Revenue or ARR last quarter.\n\nAs you might expect with a company providing a five-year revenue CAGR of 65%, the stock is trading at a high multiple. Shares of CRWD trade at 27.5x sales and 88.5x forward earnings. However, given its current hyper-growth focus, CRWD definitely remains one of the cybersecurity stocks to buy for those looking to join the millionaire\u2019s club in 2025.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) was originally a firewall business that has recently migrated into cybersecurity. Wall Street analysts have an average price target of $335.87, about 5.0% higher than the current price. The Street\u2019s higher target for PANW sits at a lofty $405 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis company started off with network security and firewalls, which might tell you about how long Palo Alto has been around. However, its focus more on cybersecurity and cloud security as of recent has reflected its decision to move into new markets and strengthen its competitive edge. One of its biggest developments is its integration of AI into its services with its new Precision AI\u2122, which allows customers to increase their ability to block more advanced threats. For investors looking for potential driving catalysts, Palo Alto has recently come under more coverage ever since headlines of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi taking a bullish call position in the stock worth up to $1.25 million.\n\nDue to its current business model shift, it\u2019s no wonder the stock has taken quite a hit in its last quarterly earnings and valuation metrics. However, PANW\u2019s current 14.8x sales and 51x forward earnings have also opened up the opportunity to a relatively discounted company when compared to CRWD. While CRWD does provide more upside to investors, I would suggest all investors look out for PANW\u2019s upcoming earnings on May 20th to see how PANW intends to continue evolving.\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building. Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile SentinelOne (NYSE:S) is a much smaller company than Crowdstrike and Palo Alto Networks, this rapidly growing cybersecurity is definitely one worth keeping your eye on. So far, this stock has flown under the radar as shares are down nearly 15%, lagging behind both its sector and the benchmark S&P 500. Nonetheless, analysts do still hold out hope for SentinelOne with a street-high target of $40 \u2014 nearly double its stock price today. \r\n\r\nSentinelOne\u2019s offerings are often compared to the likes of Crowdstrike, whose Falcon platform is often competitively pitted against SentinelOne\u2019s Singularity. However, upon closer look, it\u2019s interesting to see Singularity\u2019s edge in relatively faster cybersecurity response and ability to work without an internet connection. While it does have some flaws in its scalability, we see this as largely combated by SentinelOne\u2019s highly sticky and satisfied customer base, and a potential channel for SentinelOne to grow market size in the future.\n\nSentinelOne recently reported strong financial results. Not only did the company report an industry-leading revenue growth of 47%, but it saw operating margins improve by more than 30 points YOY. Given that SentinelOne is already making improvements to shift to larger recurring enterprises to strengthen its competitive edge, investors should definitely keep this high-risk, high-reward company on their radar.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying These 2 Supercharged Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Since the advent of the internet roughly 30 years ago, there have been no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends and innovations that promised to change the growth arc for corporate America. Unfortunately, none have come close to their billed expectations. However, artificial intelligence (AI) appears ready to give the internet revolution a run for its money.\n\nAI involves the use of software and systems in place of humans. In many instances, these systems have the ability to learn and evolve without human intervention. AI-driven software and systems becoming more proficient at their tasks, or perhaps even learning new tasks, gives the technology utility across almost every sector and industry. It's the driving force behind PwC's otherworldly estimation that AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.\n\nHowever, not all of Wall Street's brightest investment minds are in agreement on how best to play the AI revolution. Although no company has benefited more directly from the rise of AI than semiconductor behemoth Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), the latest round of Form 13F filings that details trading activity during the March-ended quarter shows billionaires were, once again, headed for the exit. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nEight billionaire investors ran for the exit from Nvidia during the first quarter\n\nNvidia, which is set to report its latest quarterly operating results on Wednesday, May 22, has undeniably benefited from the buzz surrounding artificial intelligence. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the standard in high-compute data centers. More specifically, the H100 GPU is the go-to for businesses looking to train large language models and operate generative AI solutions.\n\nLast year (Nvidia's fiscal year ended on January 28), this surge in demand for AI-GPUs more than doubled the company's full-year sales and sent Data Center segment revenue screaming higher by 217%.\n\nWhat's particularly interesting about Nvidia's growth in fiscal 2024 is that it was predominantly driven by the company's phenomenal pricing power on its AI chips. With demand overwhelming supply, Nvidia had no trouble increasing the price of its top-selling GPUs.\n\nDespite these catalysts, eight billionaire money managers -- technically nine if you include recently passed billionaire Jim Simons who founded Renaissance Technologies -- were sellers of Nvidia stock in the first quarter, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (348,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe primary reason these billionaires continued to show Nvidia shares to the door might very well be history. There hasn't been a single next-big-thing trend or innovation for three decades that didn't work its way through an early innings bubble. Investors often overestimate the adoption/uptake of new technologies, leading to bubbles. There isn't a stock that would be hurt more in the short run by the AI bubble bursting than Nvidia.\n\nThese more than half-dozen billionaire asset managers are likely also thinking about how competition will adversely impact Nvidia. Both Intel and Advanced Micro Devices have introduced AI-accelerating GPUs that'll go to head-to-head with Nvidia's H100 in high-compute data centers.\n\nBut the bigger concern might be the competition Nvidia is facing from within. Its four top customers -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- make up about 40% of its net sales. But all four of these industry leaders are currently developing AI chips of their own. Even if these chips are purely to complement Nvidia's H100 GPUs, it means reduced orders after the current year.\n\nLastly, increased competition will reduce the AI-GPU scarcity that's allowed Nvidia to raise its prices into the stratosphere. As its pricing power declines, so should its gross margin.\n\nYet not every AI stock found itself on the chopping block by Wall Street's smartest money managers in the first quarter. The following two supercharged artificial intelligence growth stocks were popular buys. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings\n\nThe first AI stock that whet the whistle of Wall Street billionaires as they were dumping shares of Nvidia in the March-ended quarter is cybersecurity juggernaut CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD). Four prominent billionaires upped their positions in the latest quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (706,283 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (297,097 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (154,688 shares)\n\nThe great thing about cybersecurity is that it's steadily evolved into a basic necessity service. Businesses of any size that have an online or cloud-based presence require protection at all times from robots and hackers that seek to steal their sensitive information. Subscription-driven third-party cybersecurity solution providers like CrowdStrike are finding their services in high demand.\n\nThe secret sauce that makes CrowdStrike tick is its Falcon security platform. Falcon is cloud-native, reliant on AI and machine learning, and oversees trillions of events each week. This is to say that it's becoming more efficient at recognizing and responding to potential threats over time.\n\nThe testament to this efficacy can be seen in its gross retention rate. Despite not being the cheapest endpoint security provider by any measure, gross retention has increased from below 94% to a pretty consistent 98% in less than seven years. Businesses have demonstrated a willingness to pay more for a product that's successfully defending against breaches.\n\nFurthermore, CrowdStrike's existing clients are spending more with the company as they grow. In fiscal 2017, a single-digit percentage of its customers had purchased four or more cloud-module subscriptions. As of Jan. 31, 2024, the end of the company's latest fiscal year, 64% of its customers had adopted five or more cloud modules. These add-on sales are rapidly pushing the company toward its operating model goal of an adjusted subscription gross margin of 82% to 85%.\n\nPalantir Technologies\n\nA second supercharged artificial intelligence growth stock that billionaires were buying as they reduced their respective stakes in Nvidia is data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR). Newly filed 13Fs show that five successful billionaires purchased shares of Palantir in the quarter ended in March, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nJohn Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (3,216,525 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (1,368,832 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (769,965 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (481,634 shares)\n\nOne of the main reasons billionaires have been attracted to Palantir is its unique operating model. The company's AI-driven Gotham platform helps federal governments collect data and plan missions, among other tasks. Meanwhile, the more recently launched Foundry platform is geared at helping larger businesses make sense of their big data in order to streamline their operations. At scale, no company comes close to doing what Palantir can. On Wall Street, irreplaceability can be quite valuable.\n\nFor years, Palantir's Gotham platform was responsible for much of its growth. Government contracts are typically spread out over four of five years, which leads to highly predictable cash flow. But this is a segment with a ceiling. In other words, there are certain countries (e.g., China) that Palantir's management would never allow access to Gotham.\n\nAlthough it's still relatively early in its launch phase, Foundry is on track to be Palantir's long-term breadwinner. Palantir closed out the first quarter with 427 commercial customers, which represents a 53% improvement over the year-ago quarter. U.S. commercial customer count growth was even faster (up 69% year-over-year to 262). As Palantir lands larger businesses with Foundry, it should see its cash flow meaningfully expand.\n\nThe final selling point for billionaires with Palantir is its balance sheet. The company closed out March with nearly $3.9 billion in combined cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, with no debt. It's a company that's ready for whatever the U.S. and global economy throws its way.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "The latest trading session saw CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) ending at $348.75, denoting a +0.82% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.09%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.49%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.65%.\n\nShares of the cloud-based security company have appreciated by 22.39% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 7.36% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.78%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of CrowdStrike Holdings in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on June 4, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $0.89, indicating a 56.14% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $904.82 million, showing a 30.65% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.90 per share and revenue of $3.97 billion. These totals would mark changes of +26.21% and +29.82%, respectively, from last year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for CrowdStrike Holdings should also be noted by investors. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been no change in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. CrowdStrike Holdings currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nDigging into valuation, CrowdStrike Holdings currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 88.61. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 30.53.\n\nWe can also see that CRWD currently has a PEG ratio of 3.97. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As the market closed yesterday, the Internet - Software industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.72.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 50, which puts it in the top 20% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nTo follow CRWD in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Cisco Surpasses Estimates As It Finally Gets Some AI Action Despite Steepest Revenue Drop Since 2009",
        "content": "Cisco Surpasses Estimates As It Finally Gets Some AI Action Despite Steepest Revenue Drop Since 2009\n\nOn Wednesday, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) reported its fiscal third quarter results and both its top and bottom-line surpassed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. However, this does not change the fact that revenue suffered its steepest decline in 15 years. Like in its previous quarterly report, Cisco attributed the sales softness by consumers setting up the equipment they received during earlier quarters, stating that it expects such installations to be mostly done by the end of the fiscal year. Despite the revenue decline, its stock still went up 8% during extended trading.\n\nFiscal Third Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on April 27th, Cisco reported revenue contracted about 13% as it amounted to\u00a0$12.7 billion, still surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of $12.53 billion.\n\nAdjusted earnings amounted to 88 cents per share, also topping LSEG\u2019s consensus of 82 cents. But net income tanked 41% to\u00a0$1.89 billion, or 46 cents per share.\n\nNetworking revenue\u00a0which makes the majority of sales also melted as it dropped by 27% to $6.52 billion.\n\nCisco made a big step forward in the AI direction.\n\nDuring the quarter, the $28 billion\u00a0acquisition of security software maker Splunk was completed and although it lowered the adjusted earnings per share by a penny, it also lifted revenue with a $413 million infusion. Over time, Cisco is expected to lower costs. But what\u2019s more important is that Cisco\u2019s acquisition of Splunk means a big boost in its cybersecurity and AI ambitions, as this is its biggest acquisition in its history that spans over a big less than four decades. With Splunk, Cisco is gaining a tool to face off its rivals, like Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ: PANW) and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: CRWD), and the chance to stay relevant in a universe dominated by vicious tech titans, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon. Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Google. Cisco is well-aware it cannot go alone against the giants anymore which is why it joined forces with its long-time rival Microsoft back in 2022. The response of consumers was so good that Microsoft and Cisco expanded their partnership, offering more solutions. Together, Microsoft and Cisco showed that with joint efforts, they can help their customers even better and power their digital transformation.\n\nCisco Altered Its Fiscal 2024 Guidance\n\nCisco lifted the full year revenue guidance range it provided in February, as it now expects a figure between $53.6 billion and $53.8 billion.\n\nIt also narrowed its adjusted earnings range as it now expects them between $3.69 to $3.71.\u00a0As for\u00a0fiscal 2025 revenue, CFO Scott Herren expects low- to mid-single digits growth rate.\n\nStory continues\n\nCisco CEO Chuck Robbins expressed his content that Cisco is\u00a0approaching the end of supply chain challenges it has been struggling with for years. Cisco has undoubtedly been undergoing many changes and although recent quarters have been particularly challenging, Cisco is finally getting some AI action while there are early signs that enterprise spending is starting to recover.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +22.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which CrowdStrike falls in, has gained 0.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.89 per share, indicating a change of +56.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.90 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +26.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.80 indicates a change of +22.9% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, CrowdStrike is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRWD _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $904.82 million indicates a year-over-year change of +30.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.97 billion and $4.98 billion estimates indicate +29.8% and +25.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $845.34 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +32.6%. EPS of $0.95 for the same period compares with $0.47 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $839.08 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.75%. The EPS surprise was +15.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy in May",
        "content": "Over the past year, many tech stocks rallied on the prospects of interest rate cuts. But with the Nasdaq now hovering near its all-time highs, it might seem like the right time to take profits in some of those stocks before the bears come back.\n\nThat's a prudent strategy, but I believe investors should still be adding more high-quality blue-chip tech stocks to their portfolios instead of hastily liquidating them. For me, these three stocks are still no-brainer buys in May: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD). Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia, the world's leading producer of discrete GPUs, has been one of the market's hottest growth stocks. Its shares have soared more than 560% over the past three years as the explosive growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market has driven more companies to buy its high-end data center chips to process AI tasks.\n\nThat growth spurt initially surprised the bears. Back in fiscal 2023 (which ended in Jan. 2023), its revenue growth flatlined as its adjusted EPS dropped 25%. That deceleration was caused by the PC market's post-pandemic decline and macro headwinds for the data center market. But in fiscal 2024, its revenue and adjusted EPS soared 126% and 288%, respectively, as the popularity of ChatGPT lit a raging fire under the generative AI market.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS to grow another 84% and 93%, respectively, as the demand for new AI chips continues to outstrip available supply. Those are incredible growth rates for a stock that trades at 39 times forward earnings.\n\nNvidia's long-term growth could eventually be throttled by competition from AMD's\u00a0cheaper data center GPUs, first-party chips at hyperscale cloud providers, and the tightening export curbs on its chip sales to China. But for now, it arguably remains the easiest way to profit from the secular expansion of the global AI market.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms -- the world's top social media company, which owns Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- saw its shares rally more than 50% over the past three years even as it weathered some tough challenges.\n\nIn 2022, Meta's revenue and EPS declined 1% and 38%, respectively. That slowdown was caused by Apple's\u00a0privacy changes on iOS, intense competition from ByteDance's TikTok, and macro headwinds for the digital advertising market. At the same time, it ramped up its spending on its unprofitable Reality Labs segment. That mix of slowing growth and higher spending spooked the bulls.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut in 2023 Meta's revenue and EPS rose 16% and 73%, respectively. It countered Apple's iOS changes with new tools for gathering first-party data, widened its moat against TikTok by expanding Reels, and offset its declining ad prices with more ad impressions. It also attracted an influx of spending from Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies that wanted to reach more overseas customers. It also approved a $50 billion buyback and initiated its first dividend earlier this year.\n\nFor 2024, analysts expect Meta's revenue and EPS to grow 18% and 36%, respectively. Those are robust growth rates for a stock that trades at 24 times forward earnings.\n\n3. CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike is one of the world's fastest-growing cybersecurity companies. Unlike many of its peers, which install their services through on-site appliances, CrowdStrike only provides its end-to-end security tools as cloud-native services -- which are stickier, more cost-efficient, and easier to scale as an organization expands.\n\nCrowdStrike's revenue surged 54% in fiscal 2023 (which ended in Jan. 2023) and grew 36% in fiscal 2024. Its growth decelerated as the macro headwinds made it harder for the company to lock large customers into longer contracts.\n\nAs a result, its net new annual recurring revenue (ARR) declined in the first half of fiscal 2024. But in the second half of fiscal 2024, its net new ARR increased year over year again. That stabilization was supported by its market share gains, new government contracts, and generative AI upgrades for its extended detection and response (XDR) platform. It's also cross-selling more modules to its existing customers.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, analysts expect CrowdStrike's revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 30% and 27%, respectively. Its stock might seem pricey relative to its peers at 88 times forward earnings, but I believe its rapid growth and early mover's advantage in the cloud-native cybersecurity space justify its premium valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You'll Be Glad You Bought 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Sentiments about stocks can change sharply, especially over a five-year period. This is true of both the artificial intelligence (AI) industry and AI-driven stocks. As the technology has advanced, many AI stocks have fallen out of favor while others have moved to the forefront.\n\nLooking forward five years, nobody knows for sure which AI stocks will emerge as the market leaders. Nonetheless, some stocks will likely remain major forces in the AI industry for years to come, and three Motley Fool analysts believe investors will likely reach 2029 feeling glad they bought these companies.\n\nPoised to meet the world's need for more cybersecurity\n\nJake Lerch (CrowdStrike): My pick is CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions with a proven track record in the industry.\n\nPart of why CrowdStrike is an excellent buy-and-hold candidate is the overall growth of the cybersecurity market. In short, cybercrime is everywhere, and organizations now face enormous risks if they fail to secure their digital assets. Casino operators have seen their slot machines hacked, healthcare providers have had their billing systems compromised, and pipeline operators have watched as their infrastructure has been shut down.\n\nThis presents a significant opportunity for companies like CrowdStrike, as the demand for cybersecurity solutions is poised to surge. Statista estimates that the worldwide cybersecurity market will expand to over $500 billion by 2030, up from around $300 billion in 2022, indicating a potential for substantial growth in the sector.\n\nWith the overall market growing, CrowdStrike is leveraging its competitive advantages within the sector. The company operates a subscription-based model, selling access to its Falcon platform and various cloud-based, AI-powered security modules designed to protect endpoints, networks, and data.\n\nCrowdStrike is a one-stop shop, and it's clear that its customers like what it can offer. As CEO George Kurtz put it, \"Customers favor our single platform approach. ... CrowdStrike is cybersecurity's consolidator of choice, innovator of choice, and platform of choice to stop breaches.\"\n\nConsequently, CrowdStrike is delivering exceptional financial results. In its most recent quarter (the three months ended Jan. 31), CrowdStrike reported annual recurring revenue of $3.4 billion, up 34% from a year earlier. Moreover, CrowdStrike was profitable for the fourth straight quarter. This marks a significant milestone in the company's life cycle as regular profits have become the norm.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, analysts expect CrowdStrike to grow revenue by 30% this year and 27% next year. In summary, CrowdStrike remains an up-and-coming company in a fast-growing sector. Growth-oriented investors should take notice; this stock looks set for a bright future.\n\nBuy this SaaS stock on the heels of its fabulous quarter\n\nJustin Pope (Monday.com): My pick is Monday.com (NASDAQ: MNDY), and it's pretty obvious once you consider all the fundamentals here. The business is firing on all cylinders, as evidenced by Q1 earnings that were so good that Wall Street sent the stock soaring roughly 20% higher on the news. What got investors so excited? It boils down to a company growing both customers and profits rapidly.\n\nMonday.com is a SaaS business that sells cloud-based software on a subscription model. The product is simple -- it's a collaborative platform that helps company employees manage projects and collaborate on work tasks. The company refers to itself as a workplace \"OS,\" short for operating system.\n\nThe idea is that a person or two begin using the software, and it spreads throughout a company as it becomes popular. That's why Monday.com has a stellar 114% net revenue retention rate for customers with at least 10 users. Moreover, customers spending at least $50,000 annually grew 48% year over year in Q1 to over 2,400.\n\nMonday.com is doing this while putting up all-time highs in cash flow and non-GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, blowing away analysts' estimates by $0.21. This company still sports a modest $11 billion market capitalization, which sets up investors for stellar returns if Monday.com eventually becomes a major player in the enterprise software space.\n\nMonday.com is doing everything right, making the stock worthy of closer examination by long-term investors. Those looking five years out could have a gem on their hands today.\n\nThis AI pioneer is not going anywhere\n\nWill Healy(Alphabet): Although it is amazing how fast investors have soured on the AI prospects of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) over the past year, my choice is the Google parent. Long dominant in search, it first integrated AI into its search tool in 2001. It has since applied AI to all of its applications and products, proclaiming itself an \"AI first\" company in 2016.\n\nNonetheless, the rise of OpenAI's ChatGPT appeared to catch Alphabet off guard. Its search tool faced its first meaningful competitive threat in years when Microsoft's Bing partnered with ChatGPT.\n\nMoreover, when Alphabet responded with its generative AI product called Gemini, users gave it mixed reviews. Although it recently rolled out AI-native search to all users for the first time, investors seem more optimistic about the AI of other mega-techs such as Microsoft or Amazon.\n\nHowever, despite missteps, counting Alphabet out is likely premature. Besides its extensive experience in the AI field, Alphabet invests heavily in research. Among the companies Alphabet owns, it combined subsidiaries to form Google DeepMind, which takes a multidisciplinary approach to developing AI applications.\n\nAdditionally, Google Cloud, which uses and supports AI applications, is one of its fastest-growing segments. In the first quarter of 2024, its revenue increased 28%, compared to 15% for the company overall. It has also emerged as the third-largest cloud provider. Image source: Statista.\n\nFurthermore, Alphabet has tremendous resources to back DeepMind and Google Cloud or to buy out other businesses. As of the end of Q1, the company claimed $108 billion in liquidity, an amount unmatched by almost all of its potential competitors.\n\nIncredibly, its cash pile could continue to climb. In Q1 alone, Alphabet generated nearly $17 billion in free cash flow, and for all of 2023, that free cash flow came in at over $69 billion. This, along with its existing AI technologies, gives Alphabet tremendous optionality as it works to remain a leader in AI and related industries.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Better Cybersecurity Stock: Palo Alto Networks vs. CrowdStrike",
        "content": "Cybersecurity is a massive industry that has never been more important. Hackers are more adept at breaching systems and causing havoc for companies. Precautions must be taken to protect internal and customer data.\n\nThis requires implementing one (or several) cybersecurity solutions, and, as a result, investors should consider adding cybersecurity stocks to their portfolio, as demand for their products is massive.\n\nTwo of the most popular are Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) and CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). But which one is the better buy? Let's find out.\n\nPalo Alto and CrowdStrike compete heavily\n\nFirst, let's discuss each company's primary business within the cybersecurity realm.\n\nPalo Alto divides its business into three segments: network security, cloud security, and security operations. Its network security business includes firewalls and a zero-trust platform that prevents outsiders from accessing a network. Its cloud security platform protects cloud workloads, and the security operations platform has products like endpoint security (endpoints are network access devices like laptops) and threat detection response.\n\nCrowdStrike has a similar product lineup, although its initial business wasn't firewalls like Palo Alto. It got its start with a cloud-first security approach that started with endpoint protections and then expanded into other areas like identity protection, cloud security, threat intelligence, and endpoint detection response. So Palo Alto and CrowdStrike are direct competitors in many of their offerings.\n\nBut when you dig into their financials, a leader begins to emerge.\n\nCrowdStrike's growth is projected to remain strong this year\n\nIf you look solely at revenue growth, CrowdStrike seems to have an edge. However, this is a side effect of being a smaller business. This is on full display with CrowdStrike's growth trajectory, as its year-over-year revenue growth is slowing down the larger it gets. PANW Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nWhile CrowdStrike is growing faster than Palo Alto, the roles might be flipped if Palo Alto were the size of CrowdStrike. However, forward-looking indications aren't as bright for Palo Alto.\n\nIn the quarter that ended April 30, Palo Alto is expecting revenue growth of only 3%. (It's scheduled to report earnings results Monday.) This is a massive red flag, especially when compared to CrowdStrike, as well as other cybersecurity companies.\n\nFor the quarter that ended April 30, CrowdStrike expects revenue of around $904 million, indicating 31% growth. (It's scheduled to report earnings results on June 4.) That's quite the difference, and it shows that Palo Alto is struggling.\n\nStory continues\n\nOr is it?\n\nPalo Alto's management said during the February conference call with analysts that its guidance was \"a consequence of us driving a shift in our strategy in wanting to accelerate both our platformization and consolidation and activating our AI leadership.\" Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a huge role in powerful cybersecurity products, so this shift makes sense.\n\nHowever, CrowdStrike has been using AI since its inception to automatically detect and deal with threats without human intervention. This has given CrowdStrike an edge over Palo Alto networks in the endpoint protection game.\n\nWhich stock?\n\nTo me, this is all I need to declare CrowdStrike the winner. It already has significant AI experience, while Palo Alto is late to the game.\n\nCrowdStrike is by far the better buy here, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it starting to take some Palo Alto customers in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Alphabet, Datadog, Garmin, Salesforce and CrowdStrike",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 May 17, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet GOOGL, Datadog DDOG, Garmin GRMN, Salesforce CRM and CrowdStrike CRWD.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nBet on These 5 Top Tech Stocks Amid Cooling Inflation\n\nWall Street witnesses a new big bull as inflation resumes a downward trend. This is evident from the latest Consumer Price Index (\u201cCPI\u201d) report released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows that U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in April 2024.\n\nThe CPI rose 0.3% over the previous month and 3.4% over the prior year in April. This indicates a deceleration from March 2024, in which CPI grew 3.5%. Economists are of the view that price pressure will be down gradually and, thus, inflation will eventually incline toward the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2%. This, in turn, has raised hopes of investors regarding interest rate cuts by the Fed in September 2024.\n\nCooling inflation has pushed the stocks to record highs. The S&P 500 index closed at $5,308.15 on Wednesday, exceeding the mark of $5,300 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 1.4%, closing at $16,742.39, whereas the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached the $40,000 milestone, closing at $39,908 yesterday.\n\nInvestors looking for growth opportunities should consider investing in technology stocks in the current scenario. The likelihood of interest rate cuts bodes well for growth-oriented tech stocks. Lower interest rates are expected to boost cash inflows, especially free cash flows in the future, which remains crucial for growth-seeking tech stocks. Free cash flows help companies in pursuing acquisitions and investments in technical advancements.\n\nLower interest rates will reduce the cost of borrowings of the technology companies, which will likely bolster their growth prospects.\n\nIn addition, lower inflation will enable enterprises to sign multi-year agreements, which, in turn, will help technology companies win several valuable deals.\n\nGrowth Factors Driving Technology Stocks\n\nThe growing proliferation of generative AI technology remains a major positive for the technology sector. The ability to interact with humans, respond to questions asked in various languages, generate content, classify data and perform coding on the back of large language models (LLM) are bolstering the adoption of generative AI-backed chatbots.\n\nStory continues\n\nIncreasing adoption of Machine Learning, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality devices, quantum computing and cloud computing have been contributing well to the performances of the technology companies.\n\nGrowing demand for data centers, driven by the need for increasing cloud capacity to support AI-related workloads, is acting as a tailwind. Apart from his, strong momentum across customer relationship software, employee management tools, natural language processing tools, time tracking tools and cyber security software is highly benefiting the software companies.\n\nTechnical advancements in Internet infrastructure and the accelerated deployment of 5G technology worldwide are tailwinds. IoT-supported industrial automation, rising PC shipment and\r\ngrowing demand for smart electric appliances, wearables, electric vehicles and drones are other positives.\n\nGiven this booming scenario, it is prudent for investors to place bets on tech companies such as Alphabet, Datadog, Garmin, Salesforce and CrowdStrike for superb returns.\n\nThese stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space.\n\nAlphabet is benefiting from growing generative AI capabilities. It is cashing in on the increasing demand for LLMs with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Its Google division is gaining from solid momentum in the cloud business. Expanding data centers and strengthening its generative AI-backed cloud portfolio are positives. Google\u2019s improving search engine, on the back of major search updates, and strength in YouTube remain the key catalysts. Alphabet\u2019s deepening focus on the wearables category and expanding presence in the autonomous driving space are other positives.\n\nGOOGL has gained 42.7% over a year. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 11.8% to $7.57 per share in the past 60 days. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nDatadog is benefiting from strength in customer demand for offerings in modern observability, cloud security, software delivery and cloud service management. The solid adoption of its cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform, owing to the accelerated digital transformation and cloud migration across organizations, remains a plus. Further, a solid cloud partner base, including Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, is contributing well to its financial performance. The company is witnessing strong customer momentum due to its significant investments in sales and marketing to engage customers, increase brand awareness and drive the adoption of its platform and products.\n\nDatadog has gained 29.8% in the past year.

        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite index is at an all-time high after April\u2019s inflation rate came in weaker than expected and U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reassured markets that further interest rate hikes are unlikely. The Nasdaq is now hovering near 16,700, a pretty high level. The index of primarily technology stocks has risen 12% so far this year and is up 48% in the past 12 months.\n\nThe Nasdaq had been marching higher to start the month of May, but really took off after data showed that inflation rose 0.3% in April from March, less than the 0.4% that economists had expected. On an annualized basis, inflation in America increased 3.4%, matching forecasts.\n\nThe latest inflation data has caused relief and sent the Nasdaq higher, as investors bet that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hold off on any further interest rate hikes and may lower rates starting this September.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are Wall Street favorites: three Nasdaq stocks with strong buy ratings for May 2024.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) have been riding high, ever since the maker of USB flash drives announced its most recent financial results. Year-to-date, MU stock is up 55%, making it one of the top-performing stocks in the Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nOver the last 12 months, the company\u2019s share price has nearly doubled, having increased by about 97%. Despite the big rally, analysts see more runway ahead for Micron Technology.\n\nProfessional analysts currently have a consensus strong buy rating on MU stock, with a median price target of $135 per share. That\u2019s 6% higher than where Micron stock currently trades.\n\nAnalysts continue to expect that Micron will benefit from the AI boom, with demand for its memory and computer data storage products on the rise. Micron provides memory and flash storage for computers, data centers and cell phones.\n\nMicron next reports earnings on June 26.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is another top performing Nasdaq component, having risen about 147% in the last 12 months, including about 37% gain so far in 2024.\n\nCRWD stock jumped 23% higher after the cybersecurity firm reported its latest earnings, handily beating Wall Street estimates and raising its forward guidance. Analysts see CrowdStrike as one of the best ways to play the boom in cybersecurity.\n\nA total of 37 analysts rate CRWD stock a strong buy with a median price target of $398, 16% above current levels. Analysts continue to applaud the strong earnings growth at CrowdStrike and also like management\u2019s stated goal of achieving $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by 2030. With demand for cybersecurity services steadily rising among corporations, governments and individuals, CrowdStrike is well-positioned to capitalize.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s next earnings print will be delivered on June 4.\n\nThe Trade Desk (TTD) The logo for The Trade Desk is displayed on a smart phone.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline advertising has strengthened this year, and that has analysts singing the praises of The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD). The 19 analysts covering the company have a consensus strong buy rating on TTD stock, along with a median price of $101.71, which is 17% higher than where the share price is at right now.\n\nAnalysts expect The Trade Desk\u2019s sales and profits to accelerate along with online ad spending in coming months.\n\nThe company, which specializes in technologies that facilitate digital advertising, just reported earnings that crushed Wall Street estimates as growth on internet-connected televisions stormed back. The Trade Desk\u2019s profit rose 13% from a year earlier, while its sales were 28% higher year over year. For the current second quarter, The Trade Desk said that it expects revenue of $575 million, topping estimates of $567 million.\n\nTTD stock is up 24% on the year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Bet on These Top 5 Technology Stocks Amid Cooling Inflation",
        "content": "Wall Street witnesses a new big bull as inflation resumes a downward trend. This is evident from the latest Consumer Price Index (\u201cCPI\u201d) report released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows that U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in April 2024.\r\n\r\nThe CPI rose 0.3% over the previous month and 3.4% over the prior year in April. This indicates a deceleration from March 2024, in which CPI grew 3.5%. Economists are of the view that price pressure will be down gradually and, thus, inflation will eventually incline toward the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2%. This, in turn, has raised hopes of investors regarding interest rate cuts by the Fed in September 2024.\r\n\r\nCooling inflation has pushed the stocks to record highs. The S&P 500 index closed at $5,308.15 on Wednesday, exceeding the mark of $5,300 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 1.4%, closing at $16,742.39, whereas the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached the $40,000 milestone, closing at $39,908 yesterday. \r\n\r\nInvestors looking for growth opportunities should consider investing in technology stocks in the current scenario. The likelihood of interest rate cuts bodes well for growth-oriented tech stocks. Lower interest rates are expected to boost cash inflows, especially free cash flows in the future, which remains crucial for growth-seeking tech stocks. Free cash flows help companies in pursuing acquisitions and investments in technical advancements.\r\n\r\nLower interest rates will reduce the cost of borrowings of the technology companies, which will likely bolster their growth prospects.\r\n\r\nIn addition, lower inflation will enable enterprises to sign multi-year agreements, which, in turn, will help technology companies win several valuable deals.\n\nGrowth Factors Driving Technology Stocks\n\nThe growing proliferation of generative AI technology remains a major positive for the technology sector. The ability to interact with humans, respond to questions asked in various languages, generate content, classify data and perform coding on the back of large language models (LLM) are bolstering the adoption of generative AI-backed chatbots.\r\n\r\nIncreasing adoption of Machine Learning, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality devices, quantum computing and cloud computing have been contributing well to the performances of the technology companies.\r\n\r\nGrowing demand for data centers, driven by the need for increasing cloud capacity to support AI-related workloads, is acting as a tailwind. Apart from his, strong momentum across customer relationship software, employee management tools, natural language processing tools, time tracking tools and cyber security software is highly benefiting the software companies.\r\n\r\nTechnical advancements in Internet infrastructure and the accelerated deployment of 5G technology worldwide are tailwinds. IoT-supported industrial automation, rising PC shipment and\r\ngrowing demand for smart electric appliances, wearables, electric vehicles and drones are other positives.\r\n\r\nGiven this booming scenario, it is prudent for investors to place bets on tech companies such as Alphabet GOOGL, Datadog DDOG, Garmin GRMN, Salesforce CRM and CrowdStrike CRWD for superb returns.\r\n\r\nThese stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne-Year Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlphabet is benefiting from growing generative AI capabilities. It is cashing in on the increasing demand for LLMs with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Its Google division is gaining from solid momentum in the cloud business.

Google\u2019s improving search engine, on the back of major search updates, and strength in YouTube remain the key catalysts. Alphabet\u2019s deepening focus on the wearables category and expanding presence in the autonomous driving space are other positives.\r\n\r\nGOOGL has gained 42.7% over a year. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 11.8% to $7.57 per share in the past 60 days.

The solid adoption of its cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform, owing to the accelerated digital transformation and cloud migration across organizations, remains a plus. Further, a solid cloud partner base, including Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, is contributing well to its financial performance.

(NASDAQ: BNZI) (\u201cBanzai\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a leading SaaS marketing technology company, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Financial Summary and Recent Operational Highlights\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (\u201cARR\u201d) for March 2024 was $4.9 million, a 14.2% increase compared to Q4 2023, and a 5% increase year-over-year. Revenue of $1.1 million exceeded the operating forecast as of the previous quarter by 4%. Net Income increased sequentially by $1.9 million, a 30% increase from Q4 2023. The Company added over 230 customers in April, bringing the total number of customer wins and reactivations during the first four months of 2024 to 810. Banzai unveiled Reach 2.0, a major milestone release of the Company\u2019s flagship marketing product. Companies using Reach 2.0 include Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO), a Fortune 500 communications and security technology company; The Economist Impact, which offers partnership solutions combining think-tank rigor, media brand creativity and global influence to catalyze growth and change in the world; and CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), a fast-growing cloud security software company.\n\nBanzai has agreed with Yorkville that upon repayment of $2 million outstanding under the Yorkville Promissory Notes, Yorkville will not deliver any Investor Notice under the SEPA and will not exercise its right to convert the remainder of the $0.7 million or less outstanding under the Yorkville Promissory Notes for a period of 90 days following such repayment. Repayment of the Yorkville Promissory Notes will be conditioned upon completion of a Banzai registered offering.\n\n\u201cQ1 was a strong rebuilding quarter for Banzai compared to Q4 2023. Our positive quarterly growth was driven by improvements to both our Demio product and our customer acquisition efficiency. We are excited about the transformative potential of our new Reach 2.0 product and the new customers we\u2019ve added so far in 2024,\u201d said Joe Davy, CEO of Banzai. \u201cWe have many new, exciting product releases coming in 2024 as Banzai continues to leverage AI and data to deliver solutions that give marketers superpowers.\u201d\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nBanzai believes its non-GAAP financial measure ARR is more meaningful in evaluating its performance. The Company\u2019s management team evaluates its financial and operating results utilizing this non-GAAP measure.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, Banzai reported total revenue of approximately $1,079 thousand, representing a decrease of approximately $98 thousand, or approximately 8.3%, compared to the three months for the same period ended March 31, 2023. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower Reach revenue which declined by approximately $74 thousand due to a shift in Banzai's focus to its Demio product and decision, which decision was reversed in 2024, to begin phasing out the Reach product. In 2024 Banzai is revitalizing its focus on the Reach product through re-engineering and expanded sales efforts. Demio revenue was lower by approximately $25 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 due to churn and lower new sales period-over-period.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, Banzai\u2019s cost of revenue totaled approximately $381 thousand and approximately $412 thousand, respectively. This represents a decrease of approximately $31 thousand, or approximately 7.5%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, is due primarily to lower customer base and an approximately 4% lower average cost per customer, driven by lower infrastructure costs of approximately $45 thousand, contracted services of approximately $34 thousand, subscription payroll of approximately $14 thousand, and merchant fee costs of approximately $3 thousand. The lower contracted services and data licenses cost described above were offset by the increase of the streaming services costs of approximately $65 thousand.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, Banzai\u2019s gross profit was approximately $698 thousand and approximately $765 thousand, respectively. This represents a decrease of approximately $67 thousand, or approximately 8.8% due to the decreases in revenue of approximately $98 thousand and decreases in cost of revenue of approximately $31 thousand described above.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, Banzai reported net losses of approximately $4.5 million and approximately $3.8 million, respectively. The greater net loss is primarily due to a reduction in total other expenses of approximately $0.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, offset by an increase in operating expenses of approximately $1.1 million and a decrease in gross profit of approximately $0.1 million.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, Banzai\u2019s Adjusted EBITDA Loss was approximately $1,508 thousand, reflecting a decrease in the earnings of approximately $882 thousand compared to a loss of approximately $626 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This period-over-period decrease in earnings is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense\u00a0\u2013 related party and transaction related expenses.\n\nLiquidity\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, Banzai had cash of approximately $1.0 million.\n\nEnd-of-Year 2024 Target\n\nBanzai targets December 2024 ARR to be $8.1\u00a0\u2013 $10 million, based on the Company\u2019s March 2024 ARR, organic growth during the year as demonstrated by year-to-date 2024 customer wins and reactivations, and currently signed non-binding LOIs to acquire Cliently and Boast. The targeted December 2024 ARR does not include any additional intended acquisitions.\n\nThe midpoint target, or $9.1 million, foresees a 97% increase in ARR, which would be equally attributable to organic growth and the acquisitions currently under LOI. Banzai\u2019s management anticipates tracking the Company\u2019s progress to its targeted December 2024 ARR as part of the Company\u2019s 2024 quarterly earnings reports.\n\nAnnual recurring revenue refers to revenue, normalized on an annual basis, that Banzai expects to receive from its customers for providing them with products or services. The December 2024 ARR information provided above is based on Banzai\u2019s current estimates of internal growth, the completion of the Cliently and Boast acquisitions and those companies contributing ARR based on current levels and is not a guarantee of future performance. These statements are forward-looking and actual ARR may differ materially. Refer to the \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d section below for information on the factors that could cause Banzai\u2019s actual ARR to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\n\nAbout Banzai\n\nBanzai is a marketing technology company that provides essential marketing and sales solutions for businesses of all sizes.

Examples of forward-looking statements may include, among others, statements regarding the Company\u2019s: future financial, business and operating performance and goals; annualized recurring revenue and customer retention; ongoing, future or ability to maintain or improve its financial position, cash flows, and liquidity and its expected financial needs; potential financing and ability to obtain financing; acquisition strategy, including the Company\u2019s expectations regarding market conditions and available opportunities, the Company\u2019s ability to execute on such strategy and the expected benefits of such strategy; proposed acquisitions and, if completed, their potential success and financial contributions; strategy and strategic goals, including being able to capitalize on opportunities; the Company\u2019s expectation regarding amendment of the Yorkville Promissory Notes, which is conditioned on repayment of a portion of such notes in connection with a registered offering; expectations relating to the Company\u2019s industry, outlook and market trends; total addressable market and serviceable addressable market and related projections; plans, strategies and expectations for retaining existing or acquiring new customers, increasing revenue and executing growth initiatives; and product areas of focus and additional products that may be sold in the future.\n\nBecause forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company\u2019s control.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Cybersecurity Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for May 2024",
        "content": "The cybersecurity industry offers a long-term opportunity for investors. It\u2019s projected to maintain a\u00a012.3% annualized growth rate from now\u00a0until 2030. Many cybersecurity firms\u00a0are positioned\u00a0to attract more clients and raise their prices over time. However, some cybersecurity stocks will do better than others.\n\nInvestors should look for firms\u00a0that have\u00a0competitive advantages, strong financial growth and long-term growth prospects. Some cybersecurity firms have reported meaningful revenue deceleration, but the ones that continue to grow offer a significant opportunity for patient investors.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is the best pure-play cybersecurity stock. The corporation doesn\u2019t have much to its business model outside of cybersecurity. However, it\u2019s become a juggernaut in the industry while delivering incredible\u00a0returns for shareholders.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nShares are up\u00a0by\u00a030% year-to-date (YTD) and have quintupled over the past five years. The Falcon Platform offers $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue. That steady revenue was a part of the firm\u2019s $845.3 million in Q4 of 2024 revenue, marking a 33% year-over-year (YOY) increase.\n\nUnlike most cybersecurity firms, Crowdstrike has continued to maintain strong revenue growth. However, investors have been getting just as excited about its profits. The cybersecurity giant reported $53.7 million in GAAP net income compared to a net loss of $47.5 million in the same period last year.\n\nThe stock is a bit pricy at an\u00a081 forward\u00a0P/E ratio, but that\u2019s not stopping analysts from appreciating the big picture.\u00a0The stock is rated as\u00a0a strong buy\u00a0among 37 analysts and has a projected\u00a024% upside from current levels.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) ChatGPT logo seen on the smartphone, Microsoft (MSFT) logo seen on the laptop. Microsoft Copilot\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) dominates in numerous industries, including cybersecurity. The tech firm works with policymakers and corporations to keep sensitive information safe. It\u2019s also making cybersecurity more accessible to small businesses through Copilot for Security. Customers can use this platform\u2019s AI features to detect and address threats before they become\u00a0major\u00a0problems.\n\nBusinesses need protection, but they also need a place\u00a0where they can\u00a0safely store digital files. Microsoft Azure, the\u00a0second-largest cloud computing provider in the industry, has been a\u00a0useful\u00a0resource for many businesses. Cloud revenue has become a sizable portion of Microsoft\u2019s business. It represented\u00a0more than\u00a0half of Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0Q3 of 2024\u00a0revenue and grew by 23% YOY. Microsoft\u2019s overall revenue jumped by 17% YOY. Net income was up by 20% YOY.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts have been rushing to assign\u00a0higher price targets for Microsoft, with the highest price target currently\u00a0standing\u00a0at $600 per share. The average price target suggests an 18% upside for the tech conglomerate. Analysts have rated the stock as a strong buy.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) sign reading Google inside building\n\nSource: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is\u00a0mostly\u00a0known for its search engine. But Google Cloud is helping the company gain market share in the cybersecurity industry. The company\u2019s cloud computing platform protects digital assets,\u00a0and it\u2019s\u00a0growing faster than Microsoft.\n\nGoogle Cloud generated $9.57 billion in\u00a0Q1 of 2024,\u00a0which was 28.4% higher than the same period last year. Also, profit margins are expanding. Q1 of 2023 operating income\u00a0landed at\u00a0$191 million while this figure jumped to $900 million in Q1 of 2024.\n\nAnalysts have rated the stock as a strong buy and believe it can gain an additional 13% from current levels. Alphabet\u2019s highest price target of $225 per share suggests a 33% upside. While long-term investors want more gains, many of them have been pleased with the company\u2019s recent growth. The tech giant\u2019s shares are up by 22% YTD and have almost tripled over the past five years.\n\nOn this\u00a0date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT and GOOG.

        "content": "Investors have been making a lot of money by investing in AI stocks. Not every artificial intelligence stock has been profitable, but the winners have\u00a0been crushing\u00a0the stock market. Despite the massive run-up, some of these stocks still have the potential to make new millionaires.\u00a0It\u2019s a reflection of\u00a0how much the AI industry\u00a0is set\u00a0to grow.\n\nExperts have projected that the AI industry will maintain a\u00a036.6% compounded annual growth rate from now until 2030. That gives many corporations a lengthy runway, and these AI All-Stars may benefit the most.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background.

Many investors look at Nvidia\u2019s earnings to gauge how well the artificial intelligence industry is doing\u00a0as a whole.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors had plenty to cheer about when Nvidia reported\u00a0Q4 FY24 earnings. Revenue increased by 265% year-over-year while net income surged by 769% year-over-year. Nvidia\u2019s guidance suggests\u00a0that it\u00a0will report $24.0 billion in Q1 FY25 revenue. That\u2019s a big jump from the $7.19 billion in revenue from Q1 FY24.\n\nStrong demand for AI chips and technology suggests that Nvidia\u2019s growth can continue. Data center revenue is Nvidia\u2019s main segment, but it also benefits from other vibrant segments like gaming and professional visualization. Nvidia\u2019s automotive segment is the only one that has been down year-over-year.\n\nNvidia stock has gained 87% year-to-date and is up\u00a0by\u00a0roughly 2,200% over the past five years. It\u2019s been a generational winner, and analysts believe it has more room to run. It\u00a0is currently rated\u00a0as a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has enjoyed a strong start in the AI industry due to\u00a0a series of\u00a0acquisitions, hiring top experts in the industry, and the release of Copilot. Microsoft Copilot offers AI-powered solutions that increase productivity. You can create PowerPoint presentations and documents much quicker with this technology, and that\u2019s only scratching the surface.\n\nMicrosoft recently released\u00a0Copilot for Security which\u00a0makes\u00a0advanced cybersecurity resources more accessible to small businesses.\u00a0According to\u00a0Microsoft, its\u00a0Copilot tool allowed analysts to breeze through tasks 26% faster.\u00a0Novice analysts were also 44% more accurate on\u00a0tasks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis Copilot spinoff is one of many possibilities. Microsoft can continue to develop its Copilot product line while growing in its other segments. The tech conglomerate operates in many industries, but cloud computing is the company\u2019s\u00a0most important\u00a0opportunity.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud represented\u00a0more than\u00a0half of the company\u2019s total revenue in Q3 FY24.\u00a0It also grew by 23%\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0while Microsoft\u2019s overall revenue increased by 17%\u00a0year-over-year. The tech firm expanded its profit margins once more by reporting 20%\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0net income growth.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet Inc.

Google has a search engine market share that exceeds 90%.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Gemini blunders painted the perception of the tech giant being behind in the AI race. While Microsoft has been creating more AI products, Alphabet\u2019s Gemini era is\u00a0starting to move along\u00a0nicely.\u00a0Alphabet\u2019s revenue increased by 15%\u00a0year-over-year in\u00a0Q1 2024.\u00a0Advertising and cloud computing were the key drivers.\n\nGoogle Cloud continues to gain market share in the cloud computing industry.\u00a0Alphabet\u2019s cloud segment had a higher growth rate than Microsoft\u2019s cloud division\u00a0in the most recent quarter.\u00a0It\u2019s been that way for the past few quarters as more businesses turn to Google Cloud for storage, cybersecurity, and AI capabilities.\n\nThe stock is up\u00a0by\u00a022% year-to-date and has gained 193% over the past five years. Analysts believe\u00a0the stock\u00a0has more room to run and\u00a0rated it as\u00a0a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has established itself as a leading cybersecurity firm. Many businesses use the Falcon Platform,\u00a0resulting in $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue. Investors have been rushing to accumulate shares as the stock is up\u00a0by\u00a030% year-to-date. Furthermore, it\u2019s gained 400% over the past five years.\n\nArtificial intelligence has enhanced productivity and continues to create new possibilities. However, this technology is also available to unethical hackers who can\u00a0now\u00a0initiate more attacks. Crowdstrike has adjusted its platform in response to the rising\u00a0threat of artificial intelligence.\n\nCybersecurity is increasingly becoming a battle of AI versus AI. Crowdstrike is investing heavily in artificial intelligence features that help businesses detect threats and respond to them sooner. Those initiatives have attracted more business. Revenue increased by 33% year-over-year in Q4 FY24\u00a0while\u00a0GAAP net income came in positive at $53.7 million. It\u2019s a welcome development for a firm that reported a $47.5 million net loss in the same period last year.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a big data analytics company that offers innovative AI solutions for businesses and governments. The stock has been on a tear recently. It\u2019s up\u00a0by\u00a024% year-to-date and has more than doubled over the past year. The stock trades at a lofty 172 P/E ratio but also has a 65-forward P/E ratio.\n\nThe forward P/E ratio is more palatable, but it\u2019s still a lofty valuation. Some analysts are encouraging investors to\u00a0buy the stock anyway. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) assigned a $28 price target which suggests a 36% upside. Wedbush has a more aggressive $35 price target\u00a0that\u00a0implies a 70% upside.\n\nPalantir reported 21% year-over-year revenue growth in\u00a0Q1 2024 and achieved GAAP profitability for the 6th consecutive quarter. Rising profits will help the valuation look more attractive for long-term investors. Commercial revenue increased by 27% year-over-year\u00a0while\u00a0government revenue\u00a0was up\u00a0by 16% year-over-year.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) produces the hardware that enables many cloud computing platforms. Many data centers use the company\u2019s technology, and the computing power of AI has increased the demand for Arista\u2019s solutions.\n\nThe company\u00a0has been thriving\u00a0long before the AI boom became mainstream in 2023. The stock is up\u00a0by\u00a036% year-to-date and has soared\u00a0by\u00a0402% over the past five years.\u00a0Investors got a bit jittery after concerns about Nvidia\u00a0gobbling Arista Networks\u2019 market share, but the firm put these concerns to rest with its recent earnings report.\n\nArista Networks reported 16.3% year-over-year revenue growth in\u00a0Q1 2024. GAAP net income came to $637.7 million compared to $436.5 million in GAAP net income during the same period last year. It marks a 46.1% year-over-year increase.\n\nThe tech firm has\u00a0been winning\u00a0higher price targets since its latest earnings report.\u00a0Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) believes the stock can reach $340 per share\u00a0which\u00a0suggests\u00a0an 8%upside. KeyBanc (NYSE:KEY) is more optimistic and has set a $349 price target\u00a0which\u00a0implies\u00a0an 11% upside.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a reasonably valued chipmaker that trades at a 24.5 P/E ratio. It also offers a 1.87% yield and has maintained a compounded annual dividend growth rate of 8.62% over the past decade. The company has hiked its dividend for 19 consecutive years. The stock has more than doubled over the past five years and is up\u00a0by\u00a030% year-to-date.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s\u00a0Snapdragon chip is the go-to choice for many smartphones. AI enhancements to the chip have resulted in pro-level photos and videos. As smartphone makers rush to incorporate artificial intelligence in their technology, they will need more advanced AI chips, and Qualcomm is ready to deliver.\n\nThe company endured a slow start in 2023 as other AI stocks rallied, but\u00a0the company\u00a0has caught its stride. Revenue increased by 1% year-over-year in\u00a0Q2 FY24. That\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s better than the revenue declines from last year. Meanwhile, net income increased by 37% year-over-year to reach $2.3 billion for the quarter.\n\nOn this\u00a0date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NVDA, MSFT, GOOG, and ANET.

        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) closed the most recent trading day at $319.18, moving -0.49% from the previous trading session.

        "content": "Investing in the stock market has never been easier or more accessible. The mechanics of buying and selling stocks has been democratized. Transaction costs were eliminated, financial information is freely available and faster technology even makes day trading possible (don\u2019t do that!).\n\nIn short, it no longer takes money to make money. With as little as $500 you can begin buying and selling stocks to start building a retirement portfolio. The stock market used to be the province of the wealthy, but the playing field has been leveled. And you should be investing today.\n\nNo other asset class has helped grow wealth the way stocks can. A Deutsche Bank study showed that over the past 100 years, stocks surpassed the performance of gold by 5.6% annually, housing prices by 6.6%, Treasurys by 6.8%, and oil by 8.4% per year. It means if you are going to be putting your money to work anywhere, it ought to be in stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf you are looking to accelerate your wealth growth rate, then the companies below are three stocks to buy with $500 today.\n\nEnergy Transfer (ET) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Energy Transfer (ET).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs its name implies, midstream energy play Energy Transfer (NYSE:ET) is positioned in a prime spot of the oil and gas industry. It is the middleman that transports hydrocarbons, such as natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs), crude oil and refined products. It is spread fairly evenly across these hydrocarbons: about 27% of its business is in NGLs and refined products, 22% in crude, 21% in natural gas pipelines and 18% in gathering and processing. Over the past decade, Energy Transfer built itself into one of the largest midstream energy companies, with over 125,000 miles of pipeline. Particularly in exports, it is the industry leader with a 20% share. Yet that is where its biggest risk lies.\n\nIn January, President Joe Biden killed all new liquid natural gas (LNG) project permit approvals. His Energy Department denied ET\u2019s request for an extension on its deadline to complete its Lake Charles LNG project. That will result in further delays, raising costs.\n\nFortunately, Energy Transfer generates substantial cash flows from the rest of its business. Even after paying its distribution, which yields 8% annually, the midstream player will still be able to fund its various projects. It continues to invest in more infrastructure and has committed to spending between $2 billion and $3 billion on capital expenditures each year.\n\nFor the past few years, Energy Transfer has been hiking its distribution every quarter and last month raised it again by 3.3%. As it is one of the cheapest energy stocks in the industry, it would be an excellent wealth builder for your portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website.

Endpoint security is protecting from attack the \u201cendpoints\u201d of data usage: desktops, laptops and mobile devices.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform is the industry leader and should gain the lion\u2019s share of the industry\u2019s growth. According to\u00a0Mordor Intelligence, the $19.6 billion endpoint security market will grow at a compounded rate of almost 8% annually through 2029 when it will hit $28.8 billion.\n\nNot willing to stand still, though, CrowdStrike enhanced Falcon\u2019s security offerings by adding cloud security, identity security and security operations to its portfolio. Through a combination of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and human intervention, the platform sifts through trillions of events weekly. It quickly recognizes and responds to potential threats over time as it learns and grows.\n\nCustomers are flocking to the platform. Subscription customers using five or more, six or more, and seven or more CrowdStrike modules grew to 64%, 43%, and 27% of subscription customers, respectively. And the number of customers with over $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew to more than 580. It ended its fiscal year with 29,000 subscription customers, and ARR was up 34% year-over-year.\n\nWhile the stock is up 27.5% in 2024, shares are actually down 2% in the last three months. This sideways action provides a launchpad for investors to get on board before the next leg of growth takes off.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest, Inc.

While it was a market darling through the pandemic, investors backed away after out-of-home activities started up again. Uncertain economic conditions also caused ad dollars to dry up.\n\nThat\u2019s no longer the case. Pinterest trounced its own revenue guidance, reporting $740 million compared to the $705 million it previously thought it would generate. CEO Bill Ready noted it was the \u201cfastest user and revenue growth since 2021.\u201d The number of global monthly active users surged 12% to 518 million.\n\nNo wonder advertisers are showering Pinterest with money. It has been the case the site was a perfect destination for marketers. People collating their ideas are signaling these are the types of things they want and are looking to buy. It\u2019s an advertiser\u2019s dream, and they are seeing more conversions.

        "title": "Is It Worth Investing in CrowdStrike (CRWD) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nCrowdStrike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.17, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.17 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 41 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.8% and 7.3% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CRWD Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRWD\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for CrowdStrike here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying CrowdStrike, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs CRWD Worth Investing In?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for CrowdStrike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.90.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for CrowdStrike.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Growth-oriented investors usually aren\u2019t shy about taking more risk in exchange for a higher potential upside. However, that doesn\u2019t mean investors should become reckless.\u00a0Investors should focus on corporations that offer a good mix of competitive moat, financial growth and rising profit margins. These three growth stocks for the next Nasdaq bull run that check each box and can deliver solid returns for long-term investors.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is a profitable educational tech company that is only starting to expand its profit margins. Net profit margins for Q4 2023 came in at 8% due to resounding financial and user growth. The company reported $151.0 million in total revenue for the quarter. That\u2019s a 45% year-over-year increase.\n\nNet income was up even more. The company reported a net loss of $13.9 million in Q4 2022. Meanwhile, it turned a $12.1 million profit in Q4 2023. The big turnaround reflects Duolingo\u2019s ability to accelerate profit margin expansion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIts users should continue to show strong interest in the trend. Daily active users came to 26.9 million, up by 65% year-over-year. The company also reported a 46% year-over-year increase in monthly active users to reach 88.4 million MAUs.\n\nShares are up by 90% over the past year. The app gamifies learning new languages and has expanded into additional subjects like math and music.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a top-tier cybersecurity firm that looks poised to take market share from its competitors in the upcoming quarters. The cybersecurity giant reported 33% year-over-year revenue growth and surging profits in Q4 FY24.\n\nMost of the company\u2019s revenue is recurring, and the tally stood at $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue to wrap up fiscal 2024. Crowdstrike also reported $53.7 million in GAAP net income compared to a $47.5 million net loss in the same period last year. The stock is up by 373% over the past five years and is already off to a strong start with a 23% year-to-date gain.\n\nWall Street analysts believe the cybersecurity stock has more room to climb. The average price target suggests a 31% upside. The highest price target of $435 per share indicates shares can rally by an additional 43% from current levels. Wall Street is bullish on this stock and has given it a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a top beneficiary of the AI boom. The company\u2019s GPU chips lead the industry and are up by 78% year-to-date. However, the stock has been quiet since the start of March and has traded flat since then.\n\nThe company\u2019s May 22 earnings will change that. Nvidia stock will either soar or enter a correction. An in-between scenario seems unlikely, but Wall Street analysts are optimistic about an upswing. The average price target suggests a 17% upside. It\u2019s rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d among 41 analysts.\n\nNvidia reported a blowout earnings report in Q4 FY24. Revenue increased by 265% year-over-year while net income surged by 769% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter growth has been decelerating. Q4 FY24 revenue only marked a 22% sequential improvement. The stock trades at 34 forward P/E and 1.11 PEG ratios.\u00a0 The stock looks like it has a good valuation, assuming the firm maintains high financial growth for another year.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "Google Cloud enables CrowdStrike for Mandiant IR and MDR services\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, May 09, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--RSA Conference 2024 \u2013 CrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD) today announced an expanded strategic partnership with Google Cloud to power Mandiant\u2019s Incident Response (IR) and Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services leveraging the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae platform and the Google Cloud Security Operations platform.

        "content": "The semiconductor market has reached a tipping point, which is why savvy investors should be looking for semiconductor stocks to sell at the moment. Semiconductor stocks have been on a stellar run over the past 2 years, thanks to the rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI), 5G and data centers. However, the outlook of the industry does not look as promising going forward.\n\nDespite reaching a record $595.7 billion in revenue in 2022, the semiconductor market experienced declines across all four quarters of 2023. Moreover, due to geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, some U.S. companies are at high risk of disruption due to their geographic concentration in China.\n\nFurthermore, recent macroeconomic concerns, including inflation, high interest rates, and slowing global demand, have cast a shadow over the semiconductor sector. The Federal Reserve\u2019s tightening policy and emerging economic headwinds could make the upcoming months challenging for chip stocks. Here are three semiconductor stocks to consider selling this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a diversified portfolio that spans both semiconductor and infrastructure software segments. However, the shifting market dynamics and geopolitical tensions pose headwinds for the company.\n\nChina accounts for a significant portion of Broadcom\u2019s revenue. The country was responsible for around $11.53 billion of revenue in 2023, making it AVGO\u2019s largest geographic market. With the U.S.-China trade tensions heating up, Broadcom is exposed to regulatory risks. Any restrictions on semiconductor sales could severely impact the company\u2019s bottom line.\n\nMoreover, Broadcom\u2019s legacy software businesses, CA Technologies and Symantec, face headwinds. CA Technologies is entrenched in the declining mainframe market, while Symantec\u2019s traditional antivirus solutions are being eclipsed by cloud-native competitors like CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW).\n\nThe company\u2019s valuation multiples far exceed the semiconductor industry average. Much of Broadcom\u2019s valuation is driven by expectations around its AI business. If AI-driven growth slows down, it can cause a significant downside in the stock price.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at their San Jose campus in Silicon Valley\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is known for its historical dominance in the CPU market. However, in recent years, the company has faced significant challenges, leading to a sharp decline in its stock price. Although the company posted revenues and earnings per share above analyst expectations, the company\u2019s weak guidance for the upcoming quarter sent Intel shares tumbling. The company\u2019s stock has fallen 35% since the start of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel Foundry has reported a deal pipeline exceeding $15 billion. However, profitability remains a distant goal for the company. Intel expects Intel Foundry to remain unprofitable until at least the midpoint of this decade. In addition, Intel faces competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), which claims its N3P process will outperform Intel\u2019s 18A node.\n\nChina represents Intel\u2019s largest market, accounting for 27% of the company\u2019s total revenues. However, recent regulatory changes have highlighted Intel\u2019s heightened exposure to geopolitical risks. The Chinese government has urged state-backed organizations to reduce their reliance on foreign chips. This will have a direct impact on Intel\u2019s market share.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn recent years, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has emerged as a serious contender in the semiconductor industry. However, it faces stiff competition from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which continues to dominate this space. Despite moderately positive earnings surprises, AMD\u2019s stock has faced selling pressure of late. The stock has fallen 23% since the start of March this year.\n\nNvidia recently announced its next-generation Blackwell GPUs, coupled with advanced AI software offerings. This could pose a significant threat to AMD\u2019s market share. Although AMD\u2019s MI300 AI accelerator has made impressive gains, analysts remain cautious about its ability to compete effectively with Nvidia\u2019s upcoming products.\n\nWhile AMD has raised its FY2024 data center GPU revenue guidance from $3.5 billion to $4 billion, this pales in comparison to Nvidia\u2019s $47.5 billion in data center revenues in FY2024.\n\nWith the stock currently trading at a relatively high price-to-earnings (P/E) valuation, investors should carefully assess the risk/reward of having money invested in AMD stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohammed Saqib did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has outperformed the stock market for several years. The cybersecurity firm has almost quintupled over the past five years and has gained 24% year-to-date.\n\nMore businesses are turning to CrowdStrike to protect themselves from cyberattacks. The financial costs and reputation damage from cyberattacks are too great for most companies to risk. CrowdStrike provides a solution that has turned into $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue.\n\nThe company closed out the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 on a high note with 33% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth and $53.7 million in GAAP net income. Profits made a big turnaround as the company reported a $47.5 million GAAP net loss in Q4 FY23.\n\nCrowdStrike continues to grow as other cybersecurity companies report much slower revenue growth than just a year ago. The stock has approval from many analysts with its Strong Buy rating. The average price target implies a 27% upside.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) has been winning more attention. The credit and debit card issuer has been a household name for decades,\u00a0but\u00a0strong financial\u00a0results and a low valuation are raising demand for the stock.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the valuation. While most credit card companies have P/E ratios above 30, American Express only has a 19 P/E ratio. American Express would have to gain more than 50% from current levels just to be valued at the same level as its peers. That offers a good margin of safety.\n\nFinancials are another area of strength. American Express grew its revenue by 11% YoY in Q1 2024. Net income soared by an astonishing 34% YoY. The fintech firm attracted many younger consumers. More than 60% of its new cardholders from the quarter were Millennials and Gen Z consumers. To top it all off, investors receive a 1.19% yield just for holding onto their shares. American Express does a good job hiking its dividend, raising its payouts by 17% this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) makes it easier for people to learn new languages. The educational app trades at a $11 billion market cap and a lofty 700 P/E ratio. The valuation will scare away many value investors, but the stock is delivering impressive financial growth that can reward patient investors. As profit margins continue to improve, the valuation should become more reasonable.\n\nDuolingo is reporting high growth numbers in the areas that matter: revenue, profits and user growth. Revenue increased by 45% YoY in Q4 2023, while net income reached $12.1 million. Meanwhile, the company posted a $13.9 million net loss in Q4 2022. The switch to profitability has significantly strengthened the bullish thesis.\n\nDaily active users grew by 65% YoY to reach 26.9 million people. The educational app also had 88.4 million monthly active users, 46% higher than in the same period last year. Those growth rates should help the company rally. If net income continues to expand, the valuation will look more enticing for people who accumulate shares at current levels.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc.

The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe mega-cap tech giant is an undervalued opportunity hidden in plain sight. You may have used Google to find this article and saw some ads along the way. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the leader in online advertising, and its profit margins are getting more attractive.\n\nRevenue increased by 15% YoY in Q1 2024, while net income soared by 57% YoY. Cost cutting has been working wonders for the company\u2019s profits, just as it did for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Alphabet is getting lean and more efficient while delivering top-line growth.\n\nAlphabet only trades at a 26.3 P/E ratio despite its lead in the advertising industry. Gemini offers enticing opportunities in artificial intelligence that aren\u2019t fully reflected in the company\u2019s stock price. Furthermore, Google Cloud is gaining more market share in the cloud computing industry. Cloud revenue growth outpaced advertising revenue growth, now making up more than 10% of the company\u2019s business model. The stock looks reasonable at current levels.\n\nD.R. Horton (DHI) In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nD.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) is a home construction company with a $50 billion market cap and a 10 P/E ratio. It also trades at a reasonable 0.60 PEG ratio. The stock has outperformed the market with a 252% gain over the past five years.\n\nShares have only inched up by 1% year-to-date, but the company has been posting good financial results. Revenue increased by 14% YoY in Q2 FY24, while net income surged 24% YoY.\n\nD.R. Horton offered fiscal 2024 revenue guidance that ranges from $36.7 billion to $37.7 billion. That represents mid-single-digit YoY growth from fiscal 2023 results. The firm also has an excellent reputation with its dividend. D.R. Horton hiked its quarterly dividend from $0.25 per share to $0.30 per share in 2023, a 20% YoY increase. The company also delivered an annualized dividend growth rate of 22.05% over the past decade.\n\nSterling Infrastructure (STRL) Image of the foundation and frame of a house\n\nSterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) is a smaller construction company receiving a lot of love from investors in the know. The $3.8 billion corporation has a 26.2 P/E ratio and has gained 40% year-to-date. It\u2019s also up by almost 1,000% over the past five years.\n\nThe construction company reported another strong quarter. Revenue increased by 9% YoY in Q1 2024, while net income jumped by 58% YoY. Rapidly expanding profit margins will further reduce the P/E ratio and make it a compelling pick for long-term investors.\n\nThe company\u2019s E-Infrastructure Solutions continue to attract plenty of clients. Sterling expects high single to low double-digit revenue growth in this segment for 2024. The infrastructure firm also anticipates a strong 2024 due to its backlog.\n\nSterling also raised its 2024 guidance. The company came into the year with net income guidance of $155 million to $165 million. The new guidance now suggests Sterling Infrastructure can generate $160 million to $170 million in net income.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a high-growth sports beverage company expanding internationally. While revenue growth took a back seat in the first quarter, profit margins expanded considerably.\n\nCelsius reported 37% YoY revenue growth in Q1 2024. Most of the company\u2019s revenue came from domestic sales, but international sales exhibited 43% YoY growth. The company has plenty of opportunities to reaccelerate revenue growth as it taps into global markets.\n\nThe 89% YoY jump in net income still makes the stock attractive despite the growth deceleration. Celsius Holdings generated $77.8 million in GAAP net income. The stock is still up 42% year-to-date and has gained almost 5,000% over the past five years. Investors shouldn\u2019t expect the 5-year gains to repeat, but Celsius Holdings still has the makings of a stock that can outperform the market in the long run. The pullback after earnings has created a long-term buying opportunity.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in GOOG and CELH. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMarc Guberti is a finance freelance writer at InvestorPlace.com who hosts the Breakthrough Success Podcast.

        "content": "CrowdStrike CRWD announced that it has upgraded its Falcon Next-Gen Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) solution, which now gives it an edge over traditional SIEM products. The company also claims that the newly introduced features will improve the speed, data visualization capability and monitoring performance of the product compared with its alternatives.\n\nThe Falcon Next-Generation SIEM unifies data, security and IT, with AI and workflow automation to enhance the capabilities of security teams to stop advanced breaches. This solution will enable AI-Native SOC to search up to 150 times faster, reducing the total cost of ownership by 80% compared with traditional SIEMs.\n\nThe enhanced product includes offerings like Charlotte AI for data-based queries and investigations. The integration of Charlotte AI will enable the security analysts to make queries in natural language. The solution also comes with GenAI Promptbook, which answers the most common queries of analysts through default and custom prompts.\n\nCrowdStrike Price and Consensus CrowdStrike Price and Consensus\n\nCrowdStrike price-consensus-chart | CrowdStrike Quote\n\nThe solution also comes with a number of automated features for investigations, threat hunting, data normalization on a common standard, SIEM data on-boarding and incident enrichment.\n\nThe solution also features a number of connectors to integrate third-party IT and security data into the unified Falcon platform. Connectors like Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Exchange Online can be used as Azure connectors. Similarly, there are connectors for AWS and GCP.\n\nThe user interface of the solution, combined with direct access to advanced event search, naming customization and easy integration of threat intelligence, is expected to simplify search processes while reducing hassles for the analysts.\n\nThe introduction of new innovation in CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon Next-Generation SIEM is likely to address the growing demand for cyber security solutions, owing to the rise of advanced data breaches through AI and cloud vulnerabilities.\n\nOrganizations across the globe are continuously facing sophisticated cyber threats, making it important for them to safeguard endpoints, on-premises IT infrastructure and cloud ecosystem. This presents an opportunity for CRWD to expand its market presence through persistent improvements in its cybersecurity products.\n\nNevertheless, the company faces short-term challenges triggered by softening IT spending, high interest rates, stretched-out inflation and global geopolitical tension. CRWD is facing direct challenges from the above factors through decreased consumer spending, budgetary cuts among its enterprise customers and delayed finalization of deals.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank and Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, CRWD carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of the company have rallied 136% in the past year.\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the broader technology sector are NVIDIA NVDA, Arista Networks ANET and Salesforce CRM, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Tech Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "Undervalued tech stocks are attracting eyeballs this year because of two elements: the astronomical rise of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the three anticipated rate cuts from the now more dovish Federal Reserve.\n\nThis is why the tech sector is up 13.5% so far this year, better than the S&P 500\u2018s 9% gain. Goldman Sachs says the index will return 6%, which includes dividends, which means to beat the market this year, invest in undervalued tech stocks.\n\nAnalysts have given all three of the undervalued tech stocks we will look at a \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating with double-digit upsides. This is because they are all working on new ways to make AI more widely used and to protect data.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe first pick on this list of undervalued tech stocks is a cybersecurity expert teaming up with AWS and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). The second has a platform with over 200 million customers and wants to expand beyond Taiwan by including sports broadcasts and speedier delivery. The final selection partners with the U.S. Department of Commerce to potentially receive $6.6 billion in funding for a new manufacturing factory in Arizona.\n\nCome on, let\u2019s explore further!\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock has made a big comeback and is now selling at around $188, which is up 25% from the start of the year, but most analysts are still recommending that investors \u201cbuy\u201d the stock, with a target price of $219.5 per share for the next 12 months, a 16% upside.\n\nPart of the reason for optimism is consistent innovation and growth. For example, Amazon is working overtime to expand its Amazon Web Services (AWS) system. AWS opened a new region in Calgary, Canada, the company\u2019s second infrastructure area in the country. Amazon has also created the AWS European Sovereign Cloud to meet the needs of businesses in Europe subject to strict rules.\n\nIn the meantime, CES 2024 saw Amazon and Siemens (OTCMKTS:SIEGY) announce a partnership to link Amazon Bedrock to Siemens\u2019 Mendix platform. This alliance seeks to make creative AI technologies easy to use in many sectors.\n\nOn the streaming end, Amazon Prime Video is adding more sports shows from around the world, like NASCAR and Wimbledon tennis in certain regions.\n\nAMZN investors should monitor Amazon Prime, which includes the streaming business, since its 200 million users generated $40.2 billion in 2023. In 2021, growth was 33%; in 2023, 8%. Market saturation, notably in the U.S., caused this slowdown. Amazon is offering Prime members speedier delivery, exclusive bargains, and more entertainment, to stop the drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) investors are thrilled about its new deal with AWS, which will speed up the growth of AI and cloud security. The deal also includes making more use of Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker and standardizing security on CrowdStrike\u2019s AI-native Falcon platform.\n\nCrowdStrike and Tata Consultancy Services have also made a global strategy deal to use Falcon XDR to change the way business hacking is done. Falcon\u2019s combined protection, which includes cloud security and next-generation security information and event management\u00a0(SIEM), will be available to TCS through this deal. This will allow AI-powered system-on-chip (SOC) change that stops hacks.\n\nThe National Australia Bank and CrowdStrike are also working together to keep small and medium-sized businesses safe online.\n\nThese interactions and partnerships have made CrowdStrike well-known in its sector. KuppingerColeand IDC rank it as a leader in Identity Threat Detection and Response and in the 2024 Worldwide Managed Detection and Response MarketScape.\n\nLastly, new ideas are a big part of CrowdStrike\u2019s success and potential upside of 25%. CrowdStrike said at Google Cloud Next \u201924 that it would also be adding new security tools to the Google Cloud Marketplace.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and the U.S. Department of Commerce recently agreed to collaborate. As a result of the tie-up, TSMC could receive up to $6.6 billion in funds through the CHIPS Act.\n\nIt\u2019s part of their plan to build a third manufacturing plant in Arizona. That plant will make advanced electronics. With this addition, TSMC will have invested over $65 billion in Arizona so far.\u200b\n\nTSMC is also expanding its business worldwide, opening a second chipmaking plant in Japan. The new factory is part of Taiwan-based TSMC\u2019s plan to increase the reliability of its supply chain and expand its production sites.\u200b\n\nIn addition, India and TSMC are working together to see if it is possible to set up a hub for semiconductors there. This move is part of larger talks between Taiwan and India.\n\nThe excitement around chipmaker Nvidia is also helping TSMC\u2019s shares. Thanks to its AI hardware solutions, Nvidia is the third U.S. firm with a $2 trillion market worth and is driving the tech-led market revival in 2024.\n\nTSMC\u2019s shares rose after Morgan Stanley boosted its Nvidia target price, illustrating their correlation. However, TSMC does not need Nvidia to stand on its own feet; the stock holds a \u201cstrong buy\u201d consensus rating, with a 16% projected upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) standing at $312.55, reflecting a -1.66% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.13%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.08%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.1%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the cloud-based security company had gained 1.3% over the past month.

The company plans to announce its earnings on June 4, 2024.

        "content": "CrowdStrike CRWD has unveiled new Cloud Detection and Response (CDR) innovations aimed at streamlining threat hunting and enhancing visibility across cloud, identity and endpoints. With cloud intrusions growing 75% in the past year, the ecosystem has become a prime target for cyber adversaries that exploit identity-based attacks and visibility gaps across fragmented platforms.\n\nTo address these challenges, CrowdStrike's latest release combines its expertise in managed threat hunting with its Cloud Native Application Protection Platform. This unified approach sets a new standard for CDR, offering comprehensive visibility across cloud environments, identities and endpoints. By consolidating tools and closing visibility gaps, CRWD empowers Cloud SecOps teams to swiftly detect and respond to threats, thereby minimizing the risk of cloud breaches.\n\nThe significance of proactive detection and response is underscored by incidents like the Summer 2023 breach of Microsoft Exchange Online, which was called \"preventable\" by the DHS Cyber Safety Review Board. Adversaries often exploit identity-based attacks in cloud environments, highlighting the importance of robust security measures.\n\nCrowdStrike Price and Consensus CrowdStrike Price and Consensus\n\nCrowdStrike price-consensus-chart | CrowdStrike Quote\n\nCrowdStrike's CDR innovations include expanded visibility into cloud control plane activity, protection against cloud identity threats and tracking of adversary lateral movement from cloud to endpoint. These features enable rapid response and actionable insights, facilitating decisive remediation and reducing the impact of cyber threats.\n\nMichael Sentonas, president of the company, emphasized CRWD\u2019s commitment to setting the standard for CDR. By providing Cloud SecOps teams with the tools needed to effectively manage cloud security, CrowdStrike aims to mitigate the risk of breaches and safeguard organizations against evolving cyber threats.\n\nThe enhanced capabilities of CDR come at a time when there\u2019s a growing demand for cloud-based cybersecurity solutions, owing to the rise of data breaches triggered by rising hybrid working trends. Most remote work setups require employees to connect to employers\u2019 IT infrastructures through cloud-based off-premise work setups. The new capabilities that CDR will bring to CRWD\u2019s customers will drive the company's top line.\n\nEnterprises encounter persistent and sophisticated cyber threats to safeguard cloud, endpoints and on-premises IT infrastructure. The rising need for cybersecurity due to the growth of data breaches presents an opportunity for CrowdStrike and gives it the scope to expand its market presence.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank and Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, CRWD carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of the company have rallied 140% in the past year.\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the broader technology sector are NVIDIA NVDA, Arista Networks ANET and Salesforce CRM, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

        "title": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned +1.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has lost 6.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.89 per share, indicating a change of +56.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.90 points to a change of +26.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.80 indicates a change of +22.9% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, CrowdStrike is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRWD _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate of $904.82 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +30.7%. The $3.97 billion and $4.97 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +29.8% and +25.4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $845.34 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +32.6%. EPS of $0.95 for the same period compares with $0.47 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $839.08 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.75%. The EPS surprise was +15.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Falcon Next-Gen SIEM innovations modernize SOC operations with a single, unified platform to deliver full visibility and protection across all workloads; Falcon Insight customers receive 10 gigabytes of third-party data per day at no additional cost\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, May 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--RSA Conference 2024 --CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) today announced new CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Next-Gen SIEM innovations to liberate customers from the constraints of legacy SIEM products and power the AI-Native SOC. To accelerate SOC transformation, all Falcon Insight customers will receive 10 gigabytes of third-party data ingest per day at no additional cost to experience the speed and performance of Falcon Next-Gen SIEM.\n\nWith breakout times now measured in minutes, stopping breaches requires security operations to match the speed of the adversary. Legacy SIEMs are too slow and complex to deliver the security outcomes customers require. SIEMs have become data dumping grounds, forcing security analysts to navigate multiple data sources, tools and consoles to extract meaning from data and conduct investigations. At the same time, point products positioned as SIEM alternatives struggle with slow search speeds, limited data visualization and investigation options, and a data onboarding process that requires lengthy deployments while driving up overall costs. To give security teams the speed they need to stop breaches, the modern SOC requires a platform that converges data, security and IT, with AI and workflow automation built natively within. With this release, CrowdStrike sets the standard for the next generation of SIEM, engineered to power the AI-native SOC.\n\n\"The speed of today\u2019s cyberattacks requires security teams to rapidly analyze massive amounts of data to detect, investigate and respond to threats faster. This is the failed promise of SIEM. Customers are hungry for better technology that delivers instant time-to-value and increased functionality at a lower total cost of ownership,\" said George Kurtz, CEO and co-founder, CrowdStrike. \"The vast majority of the critical security data is already resident in the Falcon platform, saving the time and cost of data transfer to a legacy SIEM. Our single-agent, single platform architecture unifies native and third-party data with AI and workflow automation to deliver on the promise of the AI-native SOC.\"\n\nThe AI-Native SOC: Full Visibility. Faster Detection and Response.\n\nFalcon Next-Gen SIEM is the industry\u2019s answer to power the AI-Native SOC, delivering up to 150x faster search performance and an 80% lower total cost of ownership than legacy SIEMs and solutions positioned as SIEM alternatives.

        "content": "Ecosystem open to connecting data from AWS, Cloudflare, Cribl, ExtraHop, Okta, Rubrik, Zscaler and 500+ ISVs with Falcon platform data, AI and workflow automation to centralize insights and supercharge stopping breaches\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, May 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--RSA Conference 2024 \u2013 May 7, 2024 \u2013 CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) today announced that CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Next-Gen SIEM now supports the largest ecosystem of ISV data sources of any pure-play cybersecurity vendor. Data from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cloudflare, Cribl, ExtraHop, Okta, Rubrik, Zscaler and over 500 security and IT leaders can be seamlessly integrated with Falcon platform data, threat intelligence, AI and workflow automation to power the AI-native SOC and provide security teams with the centralized insights they need to stop breaches faster than ever before.\n\nSecurity operations are a data problem. The growing number of security and IT solutions in enterprise environments makes it increasingly difficult to solve. Multiple agents, disparate consoles and piecemeal workflows create data silos which require excess human integration and operational investment. Legacy SIEMs attempted to stitch data together, serving as point-in-time relief from a chronic problem. In today\u2019s AI-powered enterprise, the legacy SIEM is no longer effective, creating blind spots, prolonging investigations and preventing security teams from matching adversary speeds. Legacy data schemas complicate ingesting ever-expanding data sources. Running modern security and IT operations requires a fundamentally different AI platform approach to ingestion, analytics and response orchestration. Most importantly, it requires the foundational ecosystem of data content from the tools used by enterprises across the globe.\n\nThe CrowdStrike Falcon Next-Gen SIEM ISV ecosystem allows security teams to seamlessly ingest, retain, search and analyze data from over 500 sources. This, combined with Falcon data, threat intelligence, AI and workflow automation, advances the AI-native SOC and provides security teams with unmatched speed and accuracy to stop breaches.\n\n\"CrowdStrike\u2019s customer base, more than 500 supported integrations and diverse partner base creates unparalleled data gravity, putting us in the driver\u2019s seat to create and lead the next-gen SIEM market,\" said Daniel Bernard, chief business officer, CrowdStrike. \"The AI-powered Falcon XDR platform \u2013 which welcomes third-party data \u2013 differentiates our approach. Together with our hundreds of ISV partners, we\u2019re revolutionizing SIEM, combining an AI-native platform approach with the diverse data sources sought by the enterprise. The ability to bring any data in, instantly gain insight and automate orchestrated responses is the next-gen SIEM game changer today\u2019s enterprises need.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n500+ data sources.

        "content": "It has been a few volatile weeks for U.S. equities. After ending the first quarter of 2024 with significant gains, the S&P500 and Nasdaq posted some of their worst months in a while in April. These major indices fell 2.63% and 2.42%, respectively. This dip has led to investors reevaluating their portfolios to consider if there are any stocks they will want to sell now.\n\nMacroeconomic environment and the structural conditions within the market continue to make certain stocks untenable investments in the near and medium-terms. For one, trading multiples of U.S. equities in general are still pretty frothy. The macroeconomic data in coming weeks could still point to higher-than-expected inflation, placing bets on near-term Federal Reserve rate cuts further in doubt. Moreover, the U.S economy appears to be slowing based on recent Q1 data.\n\nWith that said, below are three sinking stocks to sell now as the market remains volatile.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe cybersecurity space has been some of the most afflicted in terms of broader macroeconomic machinations. While many enterprises have moved a lot of data and services to the cloud, these same businesses have, in turn, demanded a holistic approach to cybersecurity. Cybersecurity stocks posted amazing returns in 2020 and 2021 for this very reason. The macroeconomic environment, unfortunately, has made enterprises to think twice about allocating costs to the implementation of new cloud security software.\n\nThis is where SentinelOne (NYSE:S) comes in. The cybersecurity firm\u2019s \u201cSingularity Extended Detection and Response Platform\u201d leverages artificial intelligence to power cybersecurity solutions for an enterprise\u2019s cloud network. Unfortunately, macroeconomic uncertainty has created headwinds for SentinelOne\u2019s top-line growth, which slowed dramatically from triple-digit growth in 2021 and 2022 to mid-double-digit growth in 2023.\n\nSentinelOne\u2019s share price has fallen 16% on a year-to-date basis. Increased competition from dominant cybersecurity player CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) could lead to further losses.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecent news of Elon Musk\u2019s trip to China and subsequent tentative approval of the Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) autonomous system caused the electric vehicle (EV) maker\u2019s shares to rally 15% on April 29. Ultimately, Tesla will be able to improve operating margins a few percentage points, which is the implication that sparked the rally. However, waning demand in the global EV market still spells trouble for Tesla in the medium and long-term.\n\nStory continues\n\nElevated interest rates have created a waning demand environment for new vehicles, combustion engine and electric. First quarter Tesla earnings results missed revenue, gross margin, and profit estimates, underscoring the difficulty of the automotive selling environment.\n\nTesla shares have fallen 25% on a year-to-date basis. Once investors refocus on the downward spiraling EV market environment, TSLA shares could receive even more pressure. And, solidifying Tesla\u2019s position as one of the stocks investors will want to sell now.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\niPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently released its Q2 2024 earnings. And, despite various data points showing Apple\u2019s decline in China, the tech giant remained optimistic on its long-term outlook. This optimism coupled with the largest share buyback program in the company\u2019s history, $110 billion, sent shares soaring.\n\nLet\u2019s first tackle the shareholder buyback point. When a company repurchases shares from shareholders, it\u2019s usually at a premium to the current stock price and investors are satisfied. However, it\u2019s important to note while these buybacks are great for large shareholders, benefits for smaller shareholders are minimal in comparison. In other words, retail investors may get a short-term boost in the value of their investment once a share buyback program is announced, but a lot of the gains are going to go to the big fish.\n\nThe market\u2019s positive reaction to Apple\u2019s earnings announcement is also puzzling for other reasons. Apple\u2019s top-line figures still declined 4% on a year-over-year basis with iPhone sales falling 10%. The optimism that Apple\u2019s management announced doesn\u2019t seem grounded in the reality of the data coming out of China these days. As Bloomberg points out in an article, a number of independent industry research do not point to anything optimistic.\n\nHuawei\u2019s continued rise will create additional headwinds for the iPhone maker. It just seems CEO Tim Cook\u2019s optimism should be taken with a grain of salt and nothing more.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "Unveils new 24/7 cross-domain threat hunting for Microsoft Azure environments with industry-first visibility across clouds, identities and endpoints\u2014powered by elite adversary intelligence\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, May 06, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--RSA Conference 2024 -- CrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD) today announced new Cloud Detection and Response (CDR) innovations to unify industry-leading managed threat hunting with deep visibility across cloud, identity and endpoints to speed detection and response across every stage of a cloud attack. Beginning with Microsoft Azure, new CDR innovations expand visibility into cloud control plane activity, strengthening existing threat hunting for cloud runtime environments.\n\nWith cloud intrusions growing 75% in the past year, cloud is the new battleground as adversaries increasingly leverage identity-based attacks to exploit visibility gaps created by fragmented platforms and cloud security point products. At the same time, Cloud SecOps teams face an emerging skills gap in cloud security expertise that can significantly delay detection and response times to threats. With this release, the powerful combination of CrowdStrike\u2019s proven expertise in 24/7 managed threat hunting and its industry-defining Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) sets a new standard for CDR by delivering the visibility across and within clouds, identities and endpoints needed to stop cloud breaches, even as threats move laterally from cloud to endpoint.\n\n\"CrowdStrike pioneered EDR, we established MDR before it was a category and now we\u2019re setting the standard for what CDR delivers and can do for customers. Stopping cloud breaches requires rapid detection and response, but too often, Cloud SecOps teams are forced to manage multiple platforms and point products to get the visibility they need across their cloud infrastructure,\" said Michael Sentonas, president at CrowdStrike. \"The combination of CrowdStrike\u2019s industry-leading cloud threat hunting services and comprehensive CNAPP provides a powerful force multiplier for Cloud SecOps teams to consolidate tools, close gaps in visibility and deliver the security outcome that matters most \u2013 stopping the breach.\"\n\nStopping Identity-Based Attacks in the Cloud\n\nAs noted in the DHS Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), the Summer 2023 breach of Microsoft Exchange Online was \"preventable and should never have occurred.\" Adversaries commonly use identity-based attacks to breach customer cloud environments, and the security lapse noted in the CSRB report highlights the critical need to proactively detect and respond to cloud attacks, especially for Microsoft Azure environments.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith this release, CrowdStrike delivers the world\u2019s most comprehensive cloud detection and response service by:\n\nProtecting Cloud Control Planes: Beginning with Microsoft Azure, CrowdStrike expands visibility into cloud control plane activity, complimenting existing threat hunting for cloud runtime environments.

        "title": "3 Top Stocks to Buy Now That Could Help You Retire a Millionaire",
        "content": "It's possible to become a millionaire by investing in stocks. But to do so, you'll need to earn strong returns for many years. And to do that, you'll want to invest in businesses with powerful competitive advantages and attractive long-term growth opportunities.\n\nTo aid your search for these fortune-builders, here are three exceptional companies to consider investing in today.\n\n1. Berkshire Hathaway\n\nWarren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) is one of the best-performing stocks of all time. From 1964 to 2023, the venerable investment conglomerate generated astounding returns of 4,384,748% for its shareowners. And its stock price is up another 11% so far in 2024.\n\nBerkshire is a financial fortress with dependable revenue streams and more than $160 billion in cash reserves as of the end of 2023. With more than 60 operating businesses in industries spanning from insurance to transportation to energy to retail, Buffett's $867 billion behemoth is perhaps the most diversified enterprise in the market today.\n\nBerkshire's subsidiaries were chosen by Buffett for their strong competitive positions and attractive expansion prospects. Collectively, they produce annual operating earnings topping $37 billion.\n\nBuffett likes to invest this cash in new value-creating opportunities, whether that be acquiring businesses outright or buying their shares in the stock market. Berkshire's portfolio holds large positions in top-tier companies like Apple, Coca-Cola, and Occidental Petroleum.\n\nNotably, Berkshire has a well-crafted succession plan in place for when the legendary investor eventually retires. Buffett's trusted lieutenants, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, will manage the company's investment portfolio after he steps down, and longtime Berkshire executive Greg Abel will succeed Buffet as CEO. With the next generation of its leadership team already in place, Berkshire is well-situated to reward its shareholders with wealth-building gains for many years.\n\n2. CrowdStrike\n\nAs businesses shift more of their operations to the cloud, effective cybersecurity solutions are only becoming more vital. In this increasingly dangerous realm, CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) stands between its customers and the cyber threats that would do them harm.\n\nCrowdStrike excels at safeguarding devices known as endpoints. Think laptops, tablets, and Internet of Things (IoT) appliances. The trend toward distributed workforces is making effective endpoint security indispensable for more companies -- and fueling demand for the cyber sentinel's industry-leading services.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike's artificial intelligence (AI) expertise gives it an edge over the competition. Its Falcon platform constantly grows smarter as it analyzes more than 2 trillion cyber events each day. When this AI-powered guardian detects a new threat, it immediately updates its network to defend its customers from harm.\n\nCrowdStrike's business, in turn, is booming. Its revenue and free cash flow leaped 36% and 39%, respectively, to $3.1 billion and $938 million in its fiscal year ended Jan. 31.\n\nChief financial officer Burt Podbere sees a path to $10 billion in annual recurring revenue in the coming years. Yet CrowdStrike appears poised for even grander ambitions. The cybersecurity leader expects its total addressable market to grow to a staggering $225 billion by 2028.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nThe rapid adoption of AI across industries promises to be one of the most lucrative opportunities for investors. Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) cutting-edge technology powers the most advanced AI applications -- and demand for its industry-leading chips is soaring.\n\nTech giants Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla depend on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to power their cloud computing platforms and AI operations. Demand for the semiconductor titan's chips is so strong that it's struggling to satisfy it. Nvidia's sales surged 265% year over year to $22.1 billion in the quarter ended Jan. 28. Its operating income, in turn, skyrocketed by a stunning 983% to $13.6 billion.\n\nSales of AI chips are projected to remain robust for the foreseeable future. The cloud giants are expected to spend heavily to upgrade their data centers as they shift to accelerated computing systems that can run AI workloads more efficiently. All told, the market for AI chips could grow to a whopping $400 billion by 2027, up from roughly $45 billion in 2024, according to chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nNvidia is the supplier of choice for these large chip buyers. Its new Blackwell processors should deliver substantial performance gains and cost savings compared to previous-generation chips. Critically, Blackwell's benefits include the potential to reduce the amount of energy consumed by AI applications by as much as 25 times.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia is investing aggressively in software that can make it easier for its customers to train and run AI models. Just days ago, Nvidia struck a deal to acquire Run:ai, which provides tools that help companies optimize their computing infrastructure for AI workloads. Nvidia's efforts to bolster its software offerings should further strengthen its competitive position within the rapidly expanding AI industry.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investors are always looking for lesser-known stocks to buy. The public\u2019s attention is sometimes only driven to the largest and most well-known stocks. However, there are equally promising growth stocks with excellent potential that are lesser known.\n\nThese stocks offer investors an excellent opportunity to get their hands on a promising prospect before massive public attention and heavy investing inflate their valuations. While they are gaining momentum in their respective industries, these three stocks have not yet risen to sky high prices and still come with a tremendous platform to take off this year.\n\nWe\u2019ll detail what makes these low flyers so appealing, including their dedication to up-and-coming technology, enticing growth statistics and estimates for this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWorkday (WDAY) Workday Layoffs. A close-up view of a Workday (WDAY Stock) sign in Pleasanton, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWorkday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is a human resources platform integrated with AI machine learning, cloud services and user data/analytics. It has 10,000 customers, including most of the Fortune 500\u2019s biggest names. It has an extensive reach across markets and industries, and businesses of all shapes and sizes use its platform.\n\nThe broad accessibility and excellent functions offered by Workday have driven excellent financial standing and results over the years. In fiscal 2024, Workday had a revenue and EPS beat, including a 17% Year-Over-Year revenue increase and a 30% operating cash flow increase.\n\nDiluted net income per share increased to $5.21 from diluted net loss per share of $1.44 in fiscal 2023. Subscription revenue makes up almost all of the company\u2019s income, and to give you perspective on the path ahead for Workday, the company also reported a subscription backlog of $20.9 billion.\n\nAside from Workday\u2019s impressive earnings, the company continues to invest in generative AI and AI marketplace software to keep itself in front of the momentum surrounding this modern tech. In addition, Workday is furthering its reach to small and medium-sized businesses through a deal with HR solutions provider Insperity, completed in February.\n\nThe company is solid in all aspects, but the spotlight other major companies have does not overly inflate it. It is an excellent investment for growth this year.\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US sports betting company DraftKings Inc. (DKNG) on screen in front of website.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe online sports gambling and betting world has never been more popular, and DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) is capitalizing on the industry\u2019s growing momentum. As of 2024, 29 states permit sports betting online. However, despite that limited percentage, DraftKings is already showing excellent growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the most recent earnings report, DraftKings reported a fourth-quarter revenue of $1.231 billion, a 44% increase from the previous year. Customers went up, and engagement and DraftKings continued to expand their available selection of sports and improve their product.\n\nDraftKings expects a revenue midpoint of around $4.775 billion this year, along with its expanding business. Considering how this success only comes from a portion of legalized betting in states, DraftKings certainly has a lot of room to grow and continue its success in the years to come.\n\nRecent acquisitions, such as Jackpocket, have further expanded DraftKings\u2019 customer base and increased its growing potential. While the stock is not the cheapest, many investors are unaware of the growth potential in sports betting, so there is no better time to buy DraftKings and watch it take off.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T.

The company reported a record free cash flow of $938.2 million and a 36% jump in revenue for fiscal 2024.\n\nWhile it has garnered attention, CrowdStrike\u2019s full potential still needs to be discovered and recognized. The company is demonstrating incredible growth. It is continuing its upward momentum through innovations and offerings such as its generative AI cybersecurity platform, CharlotteAI.\n\nCrowdStrike is seeing considerable jumps in module adoption rates at 64%, 43%, and 27% for five or more, six or more and seven or more modules, respectively. Its loyal customers are spending more and more to integrate CrowdStrike\u2019s impressive platform into their networks.\n\nExpect more cybersecurity demand and increased usage of AI tools and applications that are easy to use.

        "content": "You can call it a correction, a selloff, or maybe the beginning of a crash. Whatever term you use to describe it, equity prices are falling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is still up 8% in 2024, but it\u2019s down approximately 3% in April. That\u2019s bringing down valuations in sectors like cybersecurity. However, for long-term investors, this creates an opportunity to look for cybersecurity stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nCybersecurity has become a \u201cmust-have\u201d application. The prevalence of ransomware attacks is just one concerning trend as companies of all sizes reconcile the cost of cybersecurity along with the increasing costs of running their businesses.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s still a good time for investors to find cybersecurity stocks to buy. Despite lofty valuations, and in some cases an unclear path to profitability, cybersecurity stocks will grind higher in a higher interest rate environment. And when the economy recovers, these stocks will lead the way as corporate spending increases.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) is a behemoth in the cybersecurity space with a $95 billion market cap. PANW stock is down about half a percent in 2024. That\u2019s because of the sharp sell-off that occurred during the company\u2019s last earnings report.\n\nAt that time, the company announced a new \u201cplatformization\u201d strategy. Specifically, it was going to try to capture more market share by allowing customers to have free access to some of its services. While analysts were caught off guard, it could turn out to be a savvy move as Palo Alto attempts to counteract the spending fatigue its customers are feeling.\n\nThe resulting forecasts are showing much slower growth that caused analysts to reprice PANW stock. \u00a0In fairness, shareholders haven\u2019t suffered too much. PANW stock is still up 60% in the last 12 months even after falling about 15% since the last earnings report.\n\nAnalysts project 16% earnings growth for Palo Alto in the next 12 months. And the consensus price target of $334.35 would give PANW stock a 14.13% upside. Also, with short interest lower in the last month, there\u2019s less friction heading into the next round of earnings.\n\nZScaler (ZS) a business man pressing a button with an open lock on it that's connected to a symbol of a cloud and various security related icons. cheap cybersecurity stocks. multibagger cybersecurity stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nZScaler (NYSE:ZS) is a leader in cloud-native cybersecurity solutions. The company specializes in zero-trust applications in which every attempt to access a network, even by high-level company executives, is considered a potential threat. This combination makes ZScaler\u2019s offerings cost-effective and easy to scale.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat aside, ZS stock is down 21.25% in 2024 with the entirety of that loss coming after the company\u2019s February earnings report. A report, by the way, in which the company beat on both the top and bottom lines. One reason may be that ZScaler is not profitable today, and it won\u2019t be for some time even with ideal market conditions.\n\nStill, there was nothing in the company\u2019s report that suggests a lack of growth. And the zero trust market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% through 2030. With that in mind, investors should regard this as a normal pullback and continue to regard ZScaler as one of the top cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is one of the sector leaders in endpoint security. Contrary to what the name suggests, this is the front line of a company\u2019s cybersecurity defense. It means that every device (e.g. laptop, server, workstation, mobile device) can be an opportunity (and risk for the company) for cyber criminals to exploit and capture corporate data.\n\nThis has been the case with many of the recent ransomware attacks. In 2023, Gartner Research named CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform as one of the best endpoint security platforms of the 16 it evaluated.\n\nAnd based on CrowdStrike\u2019s growing annual recurring revenue (ARR) the company\u2019s customers continue to see the value that its services provide.\n\nCRWD stock is up 17% in 2024. However, the stock has been falling in April and the story is familiar to the other stocks on this list. A good earnings report, but investors perhaps feel the stock got overvalued. Analysts remain bullish on the stock with a consensus price target of $398.03, which gives CRWD stock a 34% upside from its price on April 30, 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

CrowdStrike earned a Leader position in every category: Product, Innovation and Market, positioned furthest to the right and highest in Innovation among all vendors evaluated, achieving the overall highest position in the report. This report reinforces CrowdStrike\u2019s global leadership in ITDR.\n\n\"Adversaries increasingly exploit identities and credentials to \u2018log in\u2019 to an environment, move laterally and execute their attacks. ITDR is a critical component of cybersecurity and mitigating risk,\" said Raj Rajamani, head of products, CrowdStrike. \"By unifying identity and endpoint protection in a single platform, single agent architecture, customers can consolidate point products, drive down costs, and eliminate complexity. Our overall leadership in the report emphasizes our pioneering, platform approach to stop breaches.\"\n\nIn 2023, 75% of attacks used to gain initial access were malware-free, highlighting the prevalence of identity-based attacks and use of compromised credentials. The AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon platform unifies endpoint and identity security to speed response time, lower overall cost of ownership and stop breaches. CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Identity Protection has shown to deliver up to 85% faster detection of identity attacks and $2 million in savings over three years.\n\nWithin the report, KuppingerCole calls CrowdStrike a \"cyber industry force\" that \"demonstrates real attention to detail where threats are related.\" KuppingerCole highlighted that \"in CrowdStrike\u2019s view, ITDR is not really a standalone product\u2014it\u2019s more of an activity that requires a platform,\" and noted the numerous CrowdStrike modules covered in additional Leadership Compass reports. The firm also recognized CrowdStrike for:\n\nComprehensive visibility of Microsoft environments: \"Falcon Identity Protection excels at its deep coverage of Microsoft environments, including on-premises Active Directory (AD) and Azure-based environments\u2026 The heavy focus on Microsoft AD and Azure, according to CrowdStrike, is that a very high percentage of successful attacks begin in those environments.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nUnifying IT and Security: \"Falcon Identity Protection offers unique features to help bridge identity administration\u2014performed by IT\u2014and identity security. It does this by providing guidance to InfoSec personnel who may not have deep knowledge of AD and Entra ID.\"\n\nCloud-native architecture: \"Offered as a cloud-native SaaS service, Falcon Identity Protection component requires a minimal on-premises footprint, requiring only a lightweight Falcon sensor on the AD domain controllers. This architecture also enables packet-level inspection and real-time alerting of suspicious events.\"\n\nDownload the report to learn more about the KuppingerCole Analysts AGLeadership Compass, Identity Threat Detection (ITDR) 2024: IAM Meets the SOC.\n\nAbout CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, has redefined modern security with the world\u2019s most advanced cloud-native platform for protecting critical areas of enterprise risk \u2013 endpoints and cloud workloads, identity and data.\n\nPowered by the CrowdStrike Security Cloud and world-class AI, the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae platform leverages real-time indicators of attack, threat intelligence, evolving adversary tradecraft and enriched telemetry from across the enterprise to deliver hyper-accurate detections, automated protection and remediation, elite threat hunting and prioritized observability of vulnerabilities.\n\nPurpose-built in the cloud with a single lightweight-agent architecture, the Falcon platform delivers rapid and scalable deployment, superior protection and performance, reduced complexity and immediate time-to-value.\n\nCrowdStrike: We stop breaches.\n\nLearn more: https://www.crowdstrike.com/ \r\nFollow us: Blog | Twitter | LinkedIn | Facebook | Instagram \r\nStart a free trial today: https://www.crowdstrike.com/free-trial-guide/\n\n\u00a92024 CrowdStrike, Inc.

        "content": "Investors spend the extra effort to research growth stocks and construct their portfolios with the hopes of outperforming the stock market. It\u2019s possible for some growth stocks to become multibaggers for patient investors. However, these same stocks may go through sharp declines on the way to their full potential.\n\nInvestors should look for corporations that exhibit impressive financial growth, rising profit margins and competitive moats. Stocks with these three factors have a greater chance of outperforming the broader market. These three growth stocks check off those boxes and can generate high returns for long-term investors.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe cybersecurity firm has an impressive recurring revenue model and continues to gain market share while most of its competitors are experiencing challenges. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) achieved 34% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth in Q4 FY24 and $53.7 million in GAAP net income. The company reported a GAAP net loss of $47.5 million in the same period last year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company\u2019s shift to profitability and rising margins bode well for long-term investors. CrowdStrike\u2019s $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue and good guidance suggest that growth can continue. The stock\u2019s only weakness is its lofty valuation. Investors will have to accept a 76-forward P/E ratio if they want to buy shares at current levels.\n\nThe stock looks more promising on any dips, but most analysts aren\u2019t waiting. The stock has a Strong Buy rating and a projected 33% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $435 per share suggests the stock can gain an additional 46%.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is gaining more traction in the beauty industry. It has reported 20 consecutive quarters of growth and looks poised to continue that streak. The cosmetics company gained 305 basis points of market share while delivering 85% YoY net sales growth. Net income jumped by 41% YoY.\n\nInvestors should feel encouraged about the company\u2019s updated fiscal 2024 outlook. The previous outlook suggested revenue would reach $901 million at the midpoint. However, new guidance implies $985 million at the midpoint. Guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share also increased from the $2.47 to $2.50 range to the $2.84 to $2.87 range.\n\nThe company focuses on clean, cruelty-free and vegan products. E.l.f. Beauty got its start as an online disruptor and is now becoming mainstream. The stock has gained 24% year-to-date and has soared by 1,300% over the past five years. Analysts believe the stock has more room to run with an average price target that implies a 17% gain.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) has done quite well for long-term investors while offering a reasonable 19 P/E ratio. The stock has gained 27% year-to-date on its way to a 102% gain over the past five years.\n\nRevenue and profits are both on the upswing. These figures increased by 11% and 33% YoY, respectively, in Q1 2024. Revenue growth was in line with the company\u2019s multi-year plan, while net income growth was a pleasant surprise. The fintech firm plans to generate annualized 9% to 11% revenue growth and EPS growth in the mid-teens over the next five years.\n\nThe company can achieve those long-term objectives as more Millennials and Gen Z consumers open American Express credit cards. More than 60% of the company\u2019s 3.4 million new card acquisitions came from those cohorts. American Express is a premium brand with a lower valuation than other credit and debit card giants. Profit margins are expanding, and that should be the case for multiple years based on management\u2019s long-term goals.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in ELF.

        "content": "2023 was a record year for ransomware attacks, with companies like MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) suffering largely publicized attacks. Despite the efforts of companies and regulators, this trend isn\u2019t slowing in 2024. The only defense will be more investments in cybersecurity, which will benefit top cybersecurity stocks.\n\nAlthough regulators are trying to crack down on ransomware attacks, hackers keep launching more severe attacks. Companies themselves cannot afford any complacency due to the risk of losses. Furthermore, with the SEC disclosure regulations in effect, they must boost their cyber threats.\n\nAs the recent UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) ransomware attack showed, threat levels are still prevalent. Due to compliance requirements and mitigating monetary losses, Chief Information Security Officers are investing heavily in security.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nToday, companies are prioritizing all cyber areas, from firewalls to endpoint security to access management. This means that more dollars will go to these top cybersecurity stocks that have the best security products.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) has grown from a firewall company to one of the top cybersecurity stocks. Today, it\u2019s a comprehensive cybersecurity platform that is a leader in over 21 cybersecurity categories.\n\nIt offers three main protection platforms: network security, cloud security and security operations. Each platform has several products with recognized industry leadership. For instance, under network security, it offers next-generation firewalls, Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), Security Services Edge (SSE) and six other products with category leadership.\n\nPalo Alto offers a compelling case to enterprise customers who want to consolidate vendors. Moreover, its products are recognized for their leadership. For instance, Gartner has recognized Palo Alto as a leader in its Magic Quadrants in single-vendor SASE, endpoint protection platforms, security service edge, network firewalls and SD-WAN.\n\nIn February, PANW stock sold off after its earnings report due to its platformization efforts. That being said, it was another solid report, with revenues up 19% year-over-year to $1.98 billion. And despite a shift of strategy to accelerated platformization, management expects 15% to 16% revenue growth in FY2024.\n\nPalo Alto Networks will continue to profit from cyber spending and benefit from vendor consolidation. Buy the stock on this bout of weakness.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nEndpoint security has been one of the areas enterprises have focused on to prevent ransomware attacks. As one of the best endpoint platforms, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is poised to profit from security investment dollars.\n\nOver the years, industry research has rated CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform as one of the best security platforms. In 2023, Gartner named it a leader in endpoint security platforms among the sixteen vendors it evaluated. Its extended detection and response (XDR) platform was rated best for its ability to execute and completeness of vision.\n\nLeveraging its leadership and cloud-native platform, CrowdStrike has maintained industry-leading growth rates while delivering impressive free cash flow. Full-year FY2024 revenues increased by 36% to $3.06 billion. Meanwhile, free cash flow increased from $676.8 million in fiscal 2023 to $938.2 million.\n\nMoreover, the company expects a solid FY2025 as customers adopt more of its Falcon modules. It expects total revenue between $3.924 and $3.989 billion, translating to at least 28% growth. That\u2019s why analysts are extremely bullish on CRWD stock.\n\nCurrently, CrowdStrike is a consensus buy among analysts with 38 buy and 7 overweight ratings. No analyst rates the stock a sell or underweight, making it one of the top cybersecurity stocks. Moreover, the average price target of $398 represents over 30% upside.\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSentinelOne (NYSE:S) offers one of the highest revenue growth rates among top cybersecurity stocks. Its AI-powered security solutions have enjoyed strong demand from large enterprises and mid-market companies. As a result, FY2023 and FY2024 revenues grew by 106% and 47%, respectively.\n\nDespite these impressive growth rates, investors have been slow to embrace the stock due to its poor profitability. However, management has stated it will focus on profitability and margin improvement in FY2025. I believe S stock has substantial upside, especially after it sold off on Q4 FY2024 results due to conservative guidance.\n\nSentinelOne\u2019s competitive position in endpoint security has allowed it to continue to win business. In Q4 FY2024, customers with annual recurring revenue of $100,000 or more grew 30% YOY to 1,133. Indeed, growth has never been an issue for SentinelOne; profitability has been the challenge.\n\nManagement has set a goal of achieving profitability by the end of FY2025. Q4 non-GAAP gross margins of 78% were in the long-term target range and management expects FY2025 margins between 77.5% and 78.5%. It will also deliver positive operating income and free cash flow by year-end.\n\nSentinelOne\u2019s revenue guidance of $812-818 million in FY2025 represents 30% growth. Reaching profitability will be an inflection point for this growth stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is CrowdStrike (CRWD) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD).\n\nCrowdStrike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.17, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.17 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 41 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.8% and 7.3% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for CrowdStrike here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying CrowdStrike, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs CRWD a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for CrowdStrike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.90.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for CrowdStrike.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "If you want to beat the market these days, you need to be investing in A-rated tech stocks. The technology sector, by far, has been the best stock market sector for the last several quarters, thanks to the advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nDespite a recent pullback, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite is up more than 30% in the last 12 months, topping both the S&P 500 (22% gain) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (13% gain).\n\nA-rated tech stocks make ideal picks for growth investors because the sector is full of companies known for rapid growth and innovation. Tech companies are often on the ground floor of the most market-moving advances \u2014 like generative AI \u2014 that can revolutionize the world.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs technology becomes a greater factor in today\u2019s world \u2014 playing a key role in banking, industry, energy, commerce, aerospace and manufacturing \u2014 tech companies can capitalize since they play an increasingly crucial role in everyday life.\n\nThe best way to find A-rated tech stocks is to use the Portfolio Grader. The Portfolio Grader is a free tool that ranks every stock on an \u201cA\u201d through \u201cF\u201d scale based on earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment, momentum and other factors.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to buy into some of the hottest stocks in recent months, these names are poised to deliver.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been my top choice in any list of A-rated tech stocks for a while now. And why not?\n\nThe chipmaker has as much as a 90% share in the high-powered graphics processing units that are most responsible for generative AI applications. And Nvidia has more up its sleeve \u2014 its GB200 Blackwell processor that\u2019s coming out later this year is estimated to be four times faster than the H100 GPU.\n\nNvidia had massive growth in 2023 with its stock price of 239%. While there are fears that Nvidia\u2019s growth may stall out in the beginning of this year as companies wait for the Blackwell processors, I think that the demand for generative AI is still going to power NVDA stock through the first half of the year.\n\nNVDA stock is up 61% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors in Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) have just as much reason to be bullish as their peers who hold NVDA stock. Palantir is up 164% over the last 12 months as the company\u2019s commercial division showed rapid growth.\n\nFor years, Palantir made its bread and butter by serving the intelligence and defense industries, using machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide real-time analysis to the Pentagon.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut in the last quarter of 2023, Palantir saw 32% growth in its commercial segment, totaling $284 million in revenue. That compares to $324 million in government contract revenue in the quarter \u2014 but only 5% growth in that segment.\n\nI\u2019m expecting the commercial revenue to top the government revenue soon. Palantir\u2019s new Artificial Intelligence Platform works with both government and commercial clients. And Palantir also has a new agreement with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) that will allow Palantir to use Oracle\u2019s cloud network to deploy products such as its Gotham and AIP platforms.\n\nIn all, I think that the recent pullback in PLTR stock makes for a great buying opportunity for a company that\u2019s only going to grow for the rest of 2024 \u2014 and possibly beyond.\n\nPLTR stock gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the first \u2014 and best \u2014 streaming companies. And it has proven to be able to adapt even in the face of massive competition to retain its position as king of the heap.\n\nNetflix showed a lot of vulnerability in 2022, with its share price dropping to below $200. Growth slowed and it appeared that other streaming services were finally starting to catch up and possibility surpass NFLX.\n\nBut then Netflix made what I think was a bold, and inspired business decision. It decided to toss away its longtime wink and nod to account sharing and instead charge a fee to any account holder who had someone outside of their household log in.\n\nRather than facing a backlash from the public, Netflix saw a massive windfall from the move for one reason \u2014 because people saw value in the product, and they didn\u2019t want to give it up. In the first quarter after the change, Netflix saw an increase of 8.8 million paid subscribers.\n\nFor the first quarter, NFLX saw revenue up 15% from a year ago to $9.37 billion. And it forecast Q2 revenue of $9.49 billion, which would be a nearly 16% increase from last year.\n\nNFLX is hitting on all cylinders. Again. The stock is up 14% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPDD Holdings (PPD) A smartphone displays the Pinduoduo (PDD) website.\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nPPD Holdings (NASDAQ:PPD) is the parent company of the Chinese e-commerce company Pinduoduo, which specializes in serving China\u2019s mom-and-pop agricultural industry.\n\nPinduoduo makes it possible for small-scale farmers to sell their fruits and vegetables directly to consumers.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there. PPD Holdings is expanding into Western markets via its Temu app, which provides Chinese goods that are sharply discounted. Temu is among the most downloaded apps in the U.S., German, the U.K., France, Canada and Italy.\n\nIn the U.S., Temu is the No. two shopping app, with monthly users increasing by 950% on a year-over-year basis in the last quarter of 2023.\n\nEarnings in the fourth quarter included revenue of $12.5 billion, up 123% from a year ago. PDD brought in a profit of $3.1 billion and an increase of 146% from the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s some risk involved with PDD. Increased tensions between the U.S. and Beijing increase the likelihood that companies like PDD could face additional restrictions from Washington. That\u2019s one reason why PDD stock is down 12% so far in 2024, despite its earnings growth and potential.\n\nPDD stock has an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader. But investing in this stock means paying attention to global politics.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe inclusion of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) proves that you can find exciting A-rated tech stocks even among the oldest and most established tech companies on the planet.\n\nIBM traces its history back for generations and punch-card based data processing machines in the 1880s. IBM was responsible for the first electronic computer, launched in 1943, and the first personal computer in 1981.\n\nToday, it\u2019s simply one of the biggest cloud infrastructure providers in the world. Its Watson AI engine and Watsonx generative AI platform have the potential to power IBM through the decade by partnering with enterprise customers.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter of 2024 included revenue of $14.5 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Net income of $1.6 billion was a massive 69% increase from last year, and earnings per share of $1.69 was up 66% from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIBM issued guidance for full-year revenue growth in the mid- single digits, and expects to generate roughly $12 billion in free cash flow for the year.\n\nIBM stock is up 12% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSpotify Technology (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) logo is on the screen of a smartphone with headphones plugged in.\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you love music, you probably know all about Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT). Spotify is a digital music, podcast and video service that provides countless tunes and audio files from hundreds of artists.\n\nThere are a few ways to make money. It sells advertisements that are targeted to its massive base of 388 million monthly active users. And it also has a premium ad-free subscription service that has 239 million monthly active users.\n\nBoth levels of users are growing rapidly. Spotify says the number monthly active users using Spotify for free increased 22% in the first quarter from a year ago, while paid premium memberships increased by 14% from a year ago.\n\nAnd that means much greater profits for SPOT stock. Spotify reported revenue of $3.6 billion in the quarter, up 20% from a year ago. Profits of $1 billion were up 31% from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThat\u2019s music to any investor\u2019s ears. SPOT stock is up 50% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs technology becomes more critical, more of our personal information and finances are online. Cloud computing makes it possible to tap into business networks at home, in the office or through a mobile device, but there are always bad actors who are looking to do damage by breaking into a network to steal or cause mayhem.\n\nSo my top pick for cybersecurity stock is CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD). Its endpoint security solutions include its Falcon platform, which secures entry points on servers, smartphones and laptops.\n\nThe company offers 27 cloud modules on its Falcon platform on a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, including corporate endpoint security, IT operations, cloud security, data protection, identity protection and cybersecurity generative AI.\n\nRoughly 64% of CrowdStrike customers subscribe to at least five modules, giving CrowdStrike an impressive revenue stream. The company brought in $845.3 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, up 33% from a year ago.\n\nCRWD stock should continue to perform as its customers base grows and its SaaS model flourishes. CrowdStrike is up 16% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA, PLTR, SPOT and CRWD.

        "content": "The U.S. economy is poised for remarkable growth driven by advancements in machine learning. This transformative technology is set to revolutionize various industries like manufacturing, retail and healthcare. Machine learning will enhance quality control and automation in manufacturing, leading to more efficient production processes and personalized products. Retail will see improved data analysis, personalized shopping experiences and increased use of robotics for tasks like inventory management. Machine learning will advance diagnostics, treatment and prevention in healthcare, allowing for earlier disease detection and tailored patient care. Machine learning will revolutionize our society in the next couple of years.\n\nThe machine learning industry expects immense growth over the next few years. From 2023 to 2032, the industry is expected to grow from $51.48 billion to $771.38 billion, exhibiting a CAGR of 35.09%. The number one reason for this development is the freshness of machine learning. These top machine learning stocks are all releasing new technological and product innovations, making all of them strong buys.\n\nTop Machine Learning Stocks: Oracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) is a computer technology company specializing in integrated cloud applications and a cloud infrastructure platform. It is valued at $115.34, an increase of 21% year-over-year (YoY).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nORCL\u2019s market cap grew from $289.81 billion in 2023 to $314.88 billion in 2024, representing an 8.65% growth rate. Other financials, like EBIT Margin, also showed promise, reaching 29.15%, or 514.8% more than the sector median. EV/Sales were valued at 7.53, 151.02% more than the sector median of 3.00. These metrics reaffirm ORCL\u2019s profitability and define it as a stock for growth and profit.\n\nORCL made headlines recently by adding generative AI capabilities to its Fusion Cloud Applications suite, its flagship product. The addition enhances the product, making it ideal for finance, marketing and service.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity company that provides cyberattack and cloud workload services. With a 132% YoY growth rate, CrowdStrike currently stands at $297.62. Additionally, it shows high potential, with Yahoo Finance analysts forecasting a 12-month price median of $393.65.\n\nThe company has consistently had revenue growth ranging from 32% to 42% over the last four quarters. In each of these periods, the revenue has been over four times more than the cost of revenue. Additionally, the FCF showed a slight dip in Q3 2023 but has been making its way up and is valued at $283.58 million in Q1 24. Like FCF, the EPS (Basic) started making new growth in Q3 2023, when it was $.04 and has grown to $.22 in Q1 2024.\n\nThe enhancement of CrowdStrike has been largely due to AI and further technological advancements. Recently, it was announced that CrowdStrike and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are collaborating to combine the powers of cybersecurity and generative AI. More specifically, this collaboration is said to lead Nvidia AI to the CrowdStrike Falcon XDR platform. That can lead to advancing AI and machine learning and, further, developing cybersecurity and cloud services that CrowdStrike offers.\n\nCrowdStrike is built upon developing technology and has excellent potential for the future. Its collaboration with Nvidia marks the first step in its machine learning and AI development.\n\nTop Machine Learning Stocks: Palantir (PLTR) An image of the Palantir company logo\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon/Shutterstock\n\nPalantir is a SaaS company specializing internationally in the public and private sectors. It provides a robust end-to-end infrastructure, which makes its products competitive. Its services incorporate AI and ML to make raw data usable.\n\nPLTR saw its first profitable year in FY2023, making $209.82 million. The company\u2019s revenue is expected to grow rapidly, with ever-increasing EPS estimates. YoY quarterly growth is sitting at 202.5%, primarily due to 2023 being a break-out year. An exemplary debt/equity of 6.44% corroborates all other indicators of a strong financial status.\n\nAll seven Wall St. analysts covering PLTR have raised EPS estimates in the past 90 days, which is crucial given that Q1 earnings will be released on May 6th. The expansion of Palantir has come with many accolades, leading to it gaining market recognition. Towards the end of FY2023, PLTR was the No. 1 Vendor in AI, data science, and machine learning. An increase in good press will surely increase the number of clients, leading to higher earnings.\n\nWhile many are bearish on this stock, I am pretty bullish, given that earnings are rising and frequent positive EPS revisions exist. A solid technical base and exceptional finances make this stock a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "content": "It's undeniable that artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the technology landscape as we know it. This is evident by the number of AI-related tech companies that are perched among the most valuable companies in the world, as measured by market cap.\n\nMicrosoft sits high atop the list and is the only one to boast a market cap that exceeds $3 trillion. It wrested the crown from Apple, which continues to cling to second place with $2.6 trillion. Nvidia, fueled by its gold-standard AI processors, has gained 200% over the past year to take the third spot, worth just over $2 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- each with strong ties to AI -- sport market caps of between $1.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion.\n\nWith a market cap of less than $73 billion as of this writing, it might seem like heresy to suggest that CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) might have a shot at the $1 trillion club. However, the need to defend against AI-fueled cybersecurity attacks will only increase from here. CrowdStrike's ever-improving algorithms and cloud-native platform provide the foundation for the company's success, which suggests it's only a matter of time before it joins this exclusive fraternity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAI in its DNA\n\nThe global average cost of a data breach in 2023 was $4.45 million, according to a report by IBM, and that amount grows with each passing year. With the increasing stakes and the vast potential for business disruption, cybersecurity has become one of the most important considerations for any business. That's where CrowdStrike comes in.\n\nThe company's Falcon platform provides the industry's most sophisticated threat protection, leveraging advanced AI and machine learning to stop threats within seconds while also preventing future attacks. The system is trained on more than 2 trillion threat events per day, and its AI-powered system improves with each encounter. CrowdStrike has expanded beyond its endpoint security roots, providing a growing suite of products, including cloud security, identity security, security information and event management, threat intel, data protection, and exposure management services.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding, or so the saying goes. For its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 31), CrowdStrike's revenue jumped 33% year over year to $637 million, and its diluted earnings per share grew 102%, thanks to its expanding operating margin. At the same time, the company's annual recurring revenue increased 34% to $3.44 billion. Furthermore, customers are adopting a greater number of modules, as those with five, six, or seven modules increased 64%, 43% and 27%, respectively. Deals signed with eight or more modules more than doubled.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement expects the company's robust growth to continue, guiding for fiscal 2025 revenue of $3.96 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, representing growth of about 29%. It's worth noting that CrowdStrike has historically provided conservative guidance, so its actual results could conceivably be higher.\n\nThe combination of the growing cybersecurity market and CrowdStrike's increasing suite of security services is pushing the company's market opportunity higher. Management estimates the company's total addressable market (TAM) at $100 billion, growing to $225 billion by 2028.\n\nThe path to $1 trillion\n\nCrowdStrike is one of the most talked-about names in cybersecurity for its expanding suite of security solutions dating back more than a decade.\n\nIn 2023, CrowdStrike was named a leader in Gartner's 2023 Magic Quadrant for endpoint protection -- for the fourth consecutive time -- cited highest for its completeness of vision and ability to execute. CrowdStrike was also named a leader in cloud workload security according to the Forrester Wave Report for Q1 2024, which ranked CrowdStrike highest among all vendors in strategy and received the highest possible scores for vision and innovation. Despite its long and growing list of industry accolades, the company will need to continue to execute, and joining the ranks of trillionaires will take time.\n\nIn fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31) CrowdStrike generated revenue of $3.06 billion, giving it a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 24. Assuming its P/S remains constant, CrowdStrike would have to increase its revenue to about $42 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. For context, Wall Street is forecasting revenue of $3.97 billion for fiscal 2025 and $5.03 billion in fiscal 2026, so revenue of that magnitude is still a way off.\n\nIf the company were able to maintain its 33% year-over-year growth rate, CrowdStrike could reach the $1 trillion market cap threshold by 2033. However, maintaining that level of growth for a decade would be a tall order. If we decrease its average revenue growth rate to a more modest 27%, CrowdStrike could potentially reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2035.\n\nThere's reason to believe that the need for strong cybersecurity solutions will continue. The damage from cyberattacks is expected to hit $10.5 trillion by 2025, a 300% increase over the past decade, according to data compiled by McKinsey & Company. The total addressable market for security solutions is expected to surge to between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion, or roughly 10 times the current market size, over the next 20 years or so.\n\nIf CrowdStrike can capture just a small part of that growing market opportunity, it could soon join the $1 trillion club.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best growth stocks to invest in for the next 5 years. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market landscape, head over to 5 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In For the Next 5 Years.\n\nDespite facing fluctuations and pressures, the U.S. stock market has shown remarkable resilience in 2024. Following a robust performance in 2023, the broad-based S&P 500 index has delivered a 6.91% return thus far in 2024. Although concerns about a potential pullback due to high-interest rates and geopolitical risks have emerged among investors, there are still opportunities for profit in the market.\n\nToward the end of 2023, the Federal Reserve expressed optimism about the US economy, with chairman Jerome Powell highlighting progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target. A report by Confluence Technologies in January of this year indicated that this rally favored growth and volatility in the equity markets. As reported by CBS News, economists anticipate 2024 to be a year of accelerated growth, reduced inflation, and robust job creation in stark contrast to the recession concerns prevalent in 2023. The National Association for Business Economics (NABE) predicts a 2.2% increase in gross domestic product (GDP) for 2024, a notably more optimistic outlook than their projections from just two months ago. Inflation, which impacts expenses like groceries, rent, and insurance, is also anticipated to further decelerate this year, with NABE forecasting a decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to an annual rate of 2.4%, down from 4.1% in 2023 and 8% in 2022.\n\nAs Q2 commences, investor sentiment towards the stock market has shifted, with expectations leaning towards a resilient economic backdrop. This adjustment comes as recent economic indicators reveal that while inflation has moderated from its 2022 peaks, it remains above the Federal Reserve's desired levels. The market's attention turned to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) following the company's first-quarter earnings, marking the beginning of the earnings season among the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that drove much of last year's S&P 500 gains. surged by as much as 8% in after-hours trading following its announcement regarding plans to introduce more affordable models in its future vehicle lineup. Despite falling short of earnings expectations on both revenue and profit, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) exceeded estimates for gross margins, achieving 17.4% compared to the anticipated 16.5%. Given the automaker's significant weighting in the S&P 500 index, its earnings performance is expected to serve as a significant catalyst for the broader market. While hopes for lower interest rates emerged after last year's inflationary pressures eased, recent data indicating persistent inflation concerns has tempered such expectations. Therefore, the welcomed news of a slowdown in overall business activity across the nation on April 23 could provide room for the Federal Reserve to implement the one or two interest rate cuts that many traders are currently anticipating.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee Also: 11 Hot Growth Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nIn times ripe for substantial returns, many investors turn to growth stocks as a favored approach. These stocks typically boast higher share prices relative to their earnings per share, reflecting expectations of robust future growth. A key metric often utilized to identify such stocks is the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), comparing the current share price to earnings per share and indicating the premium investors are willing to pay for a stock's future earnings potential. In the previous year, growth stocks notably outpaced the S&P 500. Bloomberg in January highlighted that the S&P 500 Growth Index surged by 30% in 2023, surpassing the broader benchmark index's gain of 22% for the same period. This performance surprised many investors, especially given the Federal Reserve's consistent rate-hiking stance throughout the year. Over the past few years, certain growth stocks have not only reshaped industries but also left a significant mark on history. A prime illustration of this phenomenon is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), a semiconductor designer, whose shares have surged by an impressive 443.84% over the last five years on the back of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and semiconductor chip craze.\n\nFurthermore, Brandywine Global highlighted in its Quantitative Review of US Equities for the fourth quarter of 2023 that growth stocks within the Russell 1000 Growth Index substantially outpaced their value counterparts in the Russell 1000 Value Index. By the close of 2023, the growth index boasted returns of 42.7%, whereas the value index significantly trailed with a gain of only 11.5%.\n\nIn addition, Matt Orton, the chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management, advises investors to look beyond concerns about high valuations of U.S. stocks and instead focus on growth opportunities. Here is what he said:\n\n\u201cI fully think that the market could push 20, 21 times, and that\u2019s a perfectly fair multiple for us to pay. It\u2019s all about earnings growth and it\u2019s all about leaning into where those fundamentals are, and trying to avoid the parts of the market where you don\u2019t have a positive inflection in earnings. And if you do that, no matter what the valuation is, you can grow into it, and I think that\u2019s the main message for investors, is \u2018find growth.\u2019\u201d\n\nAmong the standout companies on our roster of promising growth stocks to consider are Salesforce, Inc.

We got a chance to initiate a position in Shopify during the 2022 growth stock selloff, with the view that this is a leading e-commerce franchise that will continue to benefit from key secular tailwinds. Like many market participants, we were concerned about the company\u2019s capital-intensive fulfillment investments in the face of a slowing e-commerce market and welcomed the news that it decided to exit the logistics business in favor of a capital-light partnership model. This change in strategy significantly narrows the downside range of outcomes, and allows us to focus on what it does so well: develop great e-commerce software solutions for brands of all sizes. We have been encouraged by Shopify\u2019s subsequent pace of innovative new product enhancements, which include the use of AI assistants to help brands run their businesses.\u201d\n\n9. Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT)\n\nP/E Ratio: 67.30\n\nQuarterly Revenue Growth: 12.74%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75\n\nHeadquartered in Columbus, Ohio, Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT), formerly known as Emerson Network Power Inc., specializes in critical digital infrastructure technology. The company's product lineup includes embedded computing systems, power and UPS systems, thermal management systems, and data center solutions such as racks and enclosures.\n\nOn February 21, Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) unveiled its fourth-quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share for the period stood at $0.56, surpassing estimates by $0.03. However, revenue for the quarter experienced a 12.7% year-over-year increase, reaching $1.87 billion, slightly missing estimates by $0.03.\n\nIn Q4 of 2023, 75 hedge funds held positions in Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT), with their total stakes reaching $3.101 billion. As of the fourth quarter of 2023, Philippe Laffont\u2019s Coatue Management emerged as the most dominant shareholder in the company, holding a position valued at $663.383 million.\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we initiated new GardenSM positions in DoorDash, GoDaddy and Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT). Vertiv is an industrial power equipment company primarily serving the data center market with a global supply chain in cooling, power, controls and services. Rising AI-driven GPU use in data centers has spiked the need for efficient thermal management solutions, an area where Vertiv is particularly strong. Cooling, which consumes ~25% of data center energy, is a significant, recurring operational cost. We believe Vertiv is well positioned to benefit from a multiyear profit cycle in data center construction activity and a mix shift toward GPU-based data centers (which consume 2X\u20133X more power).\u201d\n\n8. Block Inc (NYSE:SQ)\n\nP/E Ratio: 12344.83\n\nQuarterly Revenue Growth: 24.13%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75\n\nBlock Inc.

(NYSE:SQ) shares from $90 to $100 while reiterating a \u2018Buy\u2019 rating. This revised target implies a potential upside of 17.69% based on the most recent share price.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Block Inc. (NYSE:SQ) attracted interest from 75 out of the 933 hedge funds monitored by Insider Monkey, indicating a noteworthy uptick from the 60 hedge funds in the preceding quarter.\n\n7. Mercadolibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI)\n\nP/E Ratio: 70.35\n\nQuarterly Revenue Growth: 41.94%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\n\nMercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI) stands out as a prominent e-commerce technology firm headquartered in Buenos Aires, Argentina, catering to the Latin American market. Since its establishment in 1999, the company has operated through its core platforms, MercadoLibre.com and MercadoPago.com, offering a wide array of solutions for online transactions, including buying, selling, advertising, and payments.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI) reported a revenue of $4.3 billion, marking a notable 41.9% increase year-over-year and an impressive 83.2% surge on an FX neutral basis.

(NASDAQ:MELI), Latin America\u2019s leading e-commerce company, contributed to performance in the fourth quarter with shares rising 23.9% and closing the year up 85.7% after reporting third quarter earnings that beat Street expectations across the board. It had 59% constant-currency year-over-year growth in GMV, 69% growth in commerce revenues, 121% growth in total payments volume, and a 720bps increase in operating margins year-over-year. The company is generating above-market GMV growth across its major Latin American markets and is increasingly outperforming its peers in e-commerce, particularly in Brazil thanks to its broad selection and differentiated logistics capabilities, which enable the company to deliver items faster than its competitors. Over the last several quarters, MercadoLibre has also benefited from product innovation in fintech and solid underwriting in the growing credit business, which we believe will drive continued margin expansion and earnings growth as e-commerce in the region continues maturing over the next decade.\u201d\n\n6. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\n\nP/E Ratio: 85.78\n\nQuarterly Revenue Growth: 25.62%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 91\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, ServiceNow, Inc.

(NYSE:NOW), collectively accounting for a total stake value of $5.7 billion.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor\u00a0letter:\n\n\u201cServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) offers cloud-based solutions that improve workflow efficiency through automation and digitalization. The stock rose 26.4% in the fourth quarter, finishing the year up 82.0%. Stock appreciation was supported by strong quarterly results above expectations with 24.5% year-over-year subscription revenue growth in constant currency and 30% non-GAAP operating margins despite ongoing macro complexities. In addition, the stock benefited from growing investor expectations that the company would benefit from the integration of GenAI technology into its products, and a rise in software stocks more broadly. Management noted that key business drivers included strong traction with government customers, improving momentum with new customers, and budget consolidation into platforms like ServiceNow. In addition, the company launched its GenAI-supported product line, sold under a new higher-priced Pro Plus sku, at the end of the quarter and has already signed on multiple customers with hundreds more in the pipeline. The new product line should generate material efficiencies for customers as it improves their ability to automate and digitize, and hence we expect broader adoption of the Pro Plus sku, creating an additional growth engine for ServiceNow, supporting the company\u2019s long duration of growth.\u201d\n\nMuch like Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is one of the best growth stocks to invest in.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In For the Next 5 Years.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Best Performing Growth Stocks in January & February 2024 11 Best Revenue Growth Stocks to Invest In 14 High Growth Consumer Stocks to Buy\n\nDisclosure: None. 13 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In For the Next 5 Years is originally published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Rubrik CEO says he's hungry as ever, while the Microsoft-backed firm sizzles on IPO day",
        "content": "The roadshow pitch from Rubrik (RBRK) ahead of its Thursday IPO: In the fast-paced world of AI, we can protect data \u2014 and eventually make a load of money doing it.\n\nSaid pitch worked.\n\nRubrik stock surged 17% to $37 by the close of a rocky day on Wall Street, a sizzling response to another AI ecosystem play, similar to the appetite for Reddit's (RDDT) newly issued shares just a few weeks earlier.\n\n\"We were preparing for this moment for several years, and the market was receptive,\" Rubrik co-founder, chairman, and CEO Bipul Sinha told Yahoo Finance (video above).\n\nShares of the cybersecurity firm were priced late Wednesday at $32, above the high-end of their expected range. The stock opened for trading at $38.60.\n\nThe upsized IPO hauled in $752 million for Rubrik's expansion plans, initially valuing the company at $5.6 billion.\n\nIt was just this January when Rubrik \u2014 which Microsoft (MSFT) has invested in since 2021 \u2014 raised a Series E round that valued the company at $3.3 billion. That round was led by Bain, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Greylock, and Khosla Ventures. The firm was valued at around $1.8 billion in a prior 2017 raise.\n\n\"The company is one to watch,\" an early Rubrik investor told Yahoo Finance. Bipul Sinha, CEO, Chairman & Co-Founder of Rubrik Inc., the Microsoft-backed cybersecurity software startup, rings the opening bell during his company\u2019s IPO at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, on April 25, 2024. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nA key part of Rubrik's selling point is its well-regarded tech exec, Sinha.\n\nThe former engineer has spent extensive time in the venture capital industry. As a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sinha put dollars behind names such as Nutanix (NTNX) and Pulse News. (Lightspeed is now a major shareholder in Rubrik, with about 24.9% of shares outstanding).\n\nHe has also held engineering positions at Oracle (ORCL) and IBM (IBM).\n\nSinha founded Rubrik in 2014, working in coffee shops by the offices of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and YouTube in an effort to hire top developer talent.\n\nHe doesn't hide his modest upbringing, which has fueled his business building. \"Maximal thinking is how I lifted myself out of poverty,\" Sinha wrote in a letter in the company's IPO prospectus.\n\n\"He is the American Dream come true.\" Lightspeed Venture Partner's co-founder and partner Ravi Mhatre told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSinha said he remains as hungry as ever, despite the newfound attention around Rubrik and its future.\n\nWhile the cybersecurity market remains in growth mode, Rubrik does have to prove its worth to Wall Street. The company disclosed a loss of $354 million for the twelve months ending Jan. 31, 2024, despite subscription revenue rising 40% to $537.9 million. It posted a loss of $278 million for the twelve months ending Jan. 31, 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company noted in its prospectus that it has had losses in each period since its inception.\n\n\"Profits are paramount,\" Sinha acknowledged, though he declined to share a precise timeline on when those profits would appear on the balance sheet.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks to Buy on the Dip: April 2024",
        "content": "Dips present long-term buying opportunities for investors who can wait for conditions to improve. Some corporations exhibit stock price declines due to temporary industry-specific headwinds or macroeconomic headlines.\n\nGrowth stocks have the potential to outperform the market, but those great expectations also come with heightened volatility. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are both still up year-to-date, but both of these indices have been sliding to start the second quarter. Things can get worse before they get better, but these growth stocks offer enticing opportunities for investors who can look to 2030 and beyond.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to expand its lead in the artificial intelligence race. The company also has dominant positions in the cloud computing, gaming, advertising, and business software industries.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalysts can\u2019t get enough of the stock and believe that it has a\u00a019% upside from the current price. Microsoft is currently rated as a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d Financials came in good in Q2 FY24 as the company reported 18% year-over-year revenue growth and 33% year-over-year net income growth.\n\nMicrosoft has plenty of opportunities to generate higher growth rates and reward investors with steady cash flow. The stock has been shedding some of its gains since April and is approaching correction territory. The development has brought Microsoft below the $3 trillion valuation. Shares now trade at a 36 P/E ratio and offer a 0.75% dividend yield. Long-term returns have been good as the stock has more than tripled over the past five years.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSynopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a promising semiconductor stock that is in the middle of a correction. Shares are down by roughly 15% from their all-time highs and currently trade at a 57 P/E ratio.\n\nThe chipmaker has exhibited impressive growth rates to warrant the valuation. The firm reported 21% year-over-year revenue growth and 65% year-over-year net income growth in the\u00a0first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nSynopsys looks ready to gain market share through its\u00a0pending acquisition of Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS). Once Synopsys clears regulatory hurdles, the two companies will join forces in a move that can reward long-term investors.\n\nSynopsys is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d among 10 analysts with an\u00a0average price target of $630 per share. This price target suggests a 23% upside from the current price. The stock has received recent price targets above the average, with one target as high as $675. This price target implies a 32% gain from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world\u2019s leading online marketplace that generated $574.8 billion in net sales in full-year 2023. That\u2019s a 12% year-over-year increase. Amazon accelerated sales growth in Q4 2023 by posting 14% year-over-year growth during that timeframe. Success with domestic and international markets contributed to $170.0 billion in total Q4 2023 revenue.\n\nThe company continues to grow in multiple verticals. E-commerce is the company\u2019s biggest growth engine, but Amazon Web Services, advertising, and streaming are also key contributors with immense potential.\n\nAmazon is approaching correction territory like many large-cap tech stocks. The company\u2019s improving profit margins and declining P/E ratio can make it a pick to consider for long-term investors. The tech giant has the largest market share in cloud computing and looks poised to strengthen its profit margins in the coming quarters. Analysts are bullish on the stock and believe that it can deliver a 21% upside from current levels. The stock is currently rated as a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has an immense 40% upside based on the average price targets from 40 analysts. The stock is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d with the highest price target of $435 per share suggesting a 54% upside.\n\nThe company\u2019s Falcon Platform has become an essential resource for many business owners who want to keep their companies and stakeholders safe from cyberattacks. Hackers can do a lot of damage if they infiltrate systems and access sensitive data and documents. Most companies don\u2019t want to take that risk and prefer to invest in cybersecurity solutions.\n\nThe dynamic has worked well for Crowdstrike which recently delivered record profitability and sales. Total revenue reached $845.3 million in\u00a0Q4 FY24. It\u2019s a 33% year-over-year increase. Annual recurring revenue jumped by 34% year-over-year to reach $3.44 billion. Rising profit margins can make the 75 forward P/E ratio more manageable.\n\nThe stock is in the middle of a correction and has dropped by more than 10% since the start of April. This development can increase the stock\u2019s appeal for investors who are window shopping.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) delivers impressive growth rates across the board. Revenue increased by 45% year-over-year in Q4 2023 while daily and monthly active users increased by 65% and 46% year-over-year respectively. The language learning app now has 88.4 million monthly active users and closed the quarter with $12.1 million in net income. That\u2019s a big change from the $13.9 million net loss posted in the same period last year.\n\nThe educational tech company has a lot going for it in the long run, but investors have to contend with a\u00a0122 forward P/E ratio. The stock\u2019s current correction can help, especially if it gets deeper. Equities have had a rough start to the second quarter, but investors who have 10-year time horizons may be able to capitalize on this opportunity.\n\nDuolingo\u2019s 51% year-over-year increase in total bookings suggests that the strong financial results can continue. Analysts also feel optimistic and believe the stock has a\u00a024% upside from current levels. Duolingo is currently rated as a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has a projected 14% upside and a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating amid a correction. The company continues to attract new users and reported an 8% year-over-year increase in daily active users.\n\nUser growth contributed to the company\u2019s record earnings. Revenue grew by 25% year-over-year to reach $40.1 billion in Q4 2023. Net income more than tripled during the same period to reach $14.0 billion. The significant profit margin expansion prompted the company to establish its first quarterly dividend. The dividend is low at just $0.50 per share each quarter, but investors should expect the company to hike the dividend by 10% or more for several years.\n\nMeta Platforms is the leading social media giant and generates most of its revenue from advertisements. Adventures into artificial intelligence and virtual reality can create additional revenue streams for the company.\n\nGuidance also came in pretty good. The company anticipates Q1 2024 revenue to range from $34.5 billion to $37.0 billion. Meta Platforms generated $28.6 billion in\u00a0Q1 2023. The company\u2019s guidance for Q1 2024 implies a year-over-year growth rate ranging from 20.6% to 29.4%.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is one of the few fairly valued growth stocks remaining. The valuation isn\u2019t just based on what the company can become, but it\u2019s already reasonable given the firm\u2019s current financials.\n\nThe stock trades at a 20 P/E ratio and offers a 1.22% dividend yield. The P/E ratio is lower than most credit and debit card peers. American Express also has a higher yield than most of its competitors and has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years.\n\nAmerican Express got investors excited with impressive financial results in\u00a0Q1 2024. Revenue increased by 11% year-over-year. That\u2019s within the company\u2019s range of 9% to 11% year-over-year revenue growth beyond 2026.\n\nThe fintech firm shined with net income surging by 34% year-over-year. Diluted EPS jumped by 39% year-over-year while American Express suggested a growth rate in the mid-teens beyond 2026. American Express is also experiencing heightened demand from younger generations. 60% of the company\u2019s new cardholders are Gen Z or Millennial customers.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT, SNPS, and AMZN.

        "title": "3 Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy for Multibagger Returns: April Edition",
        "content": "An ever-growing cyber threat is one of the biggest challenges for businesses and individuals. In a dynamic world of technology, progress is not always in a positive direction. For example, \u201canother surge in cyber threats may be coming because GenAI can help create advanced business email compromise at scale.\u201d\n\nTherefore, every new technological development has its pros and cons. The global surge in cyber threats for corporate and government organizations implies a big opportunity for cybersecurity companies. As the addressable market swells, there are potential multibagger cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nTo put things into perspective, the global cybersecurity market is expected to be worth $501.6 billion by 2030. This will likely translate into sustained growth for some of the best cybersecurity companies. This column discusses three multibagger cybersecurity stocks to buy for massive value creation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the reasons for being bullish on these likely value creators.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven after a rally of 120% in the last 12 months, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is among the best cybersecurity stocks to buy. Of course, I would go slow and look at accumulating on dips. However, there is no doubt that CRWD stock will likely deliver multibagger returns in the next five years.\n\nAs an overview, CrowdStrike provides cloud-delivered protection of endpoints, cloud workloads, identity and data. Regarding the market potential, CrowdStrike believes the total addressable market will be worth $100 billion in 2024. Further, the company\u2019s \u201cAI-Native Security Platform\u201d market size is expected to surge to $225 billion by 2028. This provides ample headroom for growth.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, CrowdStrike ended FY24 with a total revenue of $3 billion. For the same period, the free cash flow was $938 million. Robust FCF provides flexibility in investing in the AI-enabled Falcon platform to make it the best comprehensive security solution.\n\nCloudflare (NET) A close-up of the Cloudflare (NET) logo at the company headquarters in California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) provides integrated cloud-based security solutions. These solutions are for platforms that include public cloud, private cloud, on-premise, software-as-a-service applications and IoT devices. NET stock has witnessed a healthy rally of almost 45% in the last six months. I remain bullish on further upside considering the business momentum.\n\nEarlier this month, Cloudflare announced the acquisition of Baseline, a cloud-native observability platform. This will be integrated into Cloudflare\u2019s developer platform, expanding the range of services provided to developers.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegarding the scale of operations, the company claims to be blocking 182 billion cyber threats daily. Further, the addressable market is significant, with 46% of revenue being spent outside the United States. To put things into perspective, the addressable market will likely expand to $204 billion by 2026. This provides ample headroom for growth.\n\nAn important point to note is that the company\u2019s operating margin was negative in 2021. Margin expanded to 4% in 2022 and 9% last year. With stellar growth, Cloudflare is positioned for healthy operating and free cash flows.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) stock has been sideways in the last 12 months. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 37, FTNT stock looks attractive from a valuation perspective compared to the other stocks discussed. I expect a strong breakout on the upside in the coming quarters.\n\nFortinet is a cybersecurity provider and convergence of networking and security solutions globally. As of 2024, Fortinet estimated a total addressable market of $150 billion for secure networking and security operations. The addressable market is likely to expand to $208 billion by 2027.\n\nAn important point to note is that Fortinet has a solid customer base with over 730,000 enterprises, service providers and government organizations. Further, the company is well diversified with a presence in more than 100 countries.\n\nFortinet has guided revenue of $5.8 billion for the current year. Last year, the company\u2019s adjusted free cash flow was $1.9 billion. Therefore, there is ample flexibility to invest in innovation-driven growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most exciting markets right now due to the seemingly unlimited potential of its applications in businesses everywhere. Many large companies are making massive investments to integrate AI into their platforms and services to stay ahead of the charge and offer customers the latest and greatest edition tech has to offer.\n\nThe three stocks we will examine today are currently on a dip and trading at a lower price than their actual value. When stocks dip due to volatility or other short-term events, investors have an excellent opportunity to buy when the stock is cheaper and see significant profits when it bounces back to its former price.\n\nWe\u2019ll detail why these three AI stocks are so prominent in today\u2019s AI market and why the dips they are facing now give investors a chance to profit from their inevitable future growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) is unique to the other stocks on this list as the company is dedicated entirely to AI software for businesses. It offers AI software-as-a-service to assist other companies looking to integrate AI platforms into their operations.\n\nThe potential applications of C3.ai\u2019s software are near the point where it is limited only by the imagination and vision of the company utilizing it. Because of the extensive range of uses possible within C3.ai\u2019s AI development platform, the company has no peers that offer a similar service that makes up direct competition.\n\nDespite its state-of-the-art AI software and lack of competition, C3.ai has been on the dip since late February. The stock has fallen over 40% this year and sits at just over $21, almost half its peak earlier this year.\n\nC3.ai has taken a hit this year due to inflation affecting businesses\u2019 spending power. However, despite these headwinds, the company is not showing a weak performance. The company\u2019s most recent earnings report showed a year-over-year revenue increase of 18% and a 58% profit margin.\n\nWhile the company could improve its earnings and is priced low, there is no reason not to believe that C3.ai will be one of the first companies to benefit from businesses\u2019 increasing demand for AI platforms.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is one of the most prominent cybersecurity companies to date and is also leading the charge in incorporating AI into its platform. Its generative AI analyst, Charlotte AI, offers advanced features as part of the company\u2019s leading Falcon platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has seen a stellar performance since the summer of 2023 when the stock shot up 300% to reach its all-time high in February of this year. In fiscal 2024, the company generated over $3 billion in revenue and generated free cash flow of $938.2 million.\n\nSubscription revenue accounts for almost all of the company\u2019s income and has some of the highest retention and adoption rates in the cybersecurity sector. While the company\u2019s outlook expects another $1 billion increase in revenue over the next year, to much surprise, the stock has fallen over $40 in the past month.\n\nConsidering Crowdstrike has been one of the most expensive cybersecurity stocks, a dip like this presents an exceedingly rare opportunity for interested investors. While the stock may dip further with such a high valuation, there is a likelihood Crowdstrike will see another leap in the years to come. That makes the current dip a one-of-a-kind chance.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with. It is a stock that has been on many investors\u2019 lists over the past few years. The AI chip manufacturer is second only to tech giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) but is in a fantastic position to capitalize on the growing demand for AI chips.\n\nThis past month, investors had a golden opportunity to buy AMD on the dip. The stock fell almost 20% due to volatility and macroeconomic headwinds. While AMD does not have as much market share as Nvidia, its products are up to par \u2014 some might say even better.\n\nAI chips allow users to extract the processing power necessary to run through the enormous amounts of data required for AI applications. While Nvidia\u2019s H100 chips are exceedingly popular, AMD\u2019s MI300 chips are even more powerful. AMD also offers open-source software that pairs with the chips, which claims to provide better accessibility to users than Nvidia\u2019s software. AMD has profitable deals with monster companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) for its chips, ensuring a steady income stream. With the coming boom in AI, AMD will certainly be at the forefront. Its current low price is something any investor should keep an eye on this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 best multibagger stocks to buy now. To skip the details about our prior multibagger stocks, go to 5 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nMultibagger is a term commonly used to describe a stock that has generated returns of over 100%. It was coined by Peter Lynch, former manager of the Magellan Fund at Fidelity Investments. Lynch used the term in his 1988 book, \"One Up on Wall Street,\" in which he discussed his strategies to identify stocks with the potential to be multibaggers or even ten or twenty-baggers.\n\nPrior Multibaggers Still Making Strides\n\nLast year in July, we made a list of the best multibagger stocks which included NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT), and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL). These three stocks have been moving on an upward trajectory and even after nine months, they continue to make their investors a lot of money.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been topping charts since the rise of generative AI. After a 239% share price return in 2023, the stock has gained 58.20% year-to-date as of April 19. Additionally, the company has experienced a trailing twelve-month EPS growth of 586.45% and sales growth of 125.85%.\n\nWith the rise of the AI trend, several companies made efforts to either compete with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) or even tried to end their dependence on the company. However, the firm is not slowing down its progress. On March 18, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) unveiled the Blackwell GPU architecture that is expected to be 2.5 to 5 times more powerful and efficient than its prior H100 and H200 chips. The company\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang said:\n\n\u201cFor three decades we\u2019ve pursued accelerated computing, with the goal of enabling transformative breakthroughs like deep learning and AI\u2026 Generative AI is the defining technology of our time. Blackwell is the engine to power this new industrial revolution. Working with the most dynamic companies in the world, we will realize the promise of AI for every industry.\u201d\n\nVertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) offers critical digital infrastructure technologies and life cycle services. Data centers like Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) are an important component of the AI revolution and the company stands to benefit significantly from it. At the time of our July 2023 article, the company had gained 184% over the last 12 months and has now recorded TTM gains of over 533%, as of April 19. Moreover, Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) has recorded EPS growth of 82.85% over the last 5 years and nearly 495% over the last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn March 19, Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) announced that it joined the NVIDIA Partner Network as a Solution Advisor to provide its liquid cooling technologies for managing AI workloads. The company\u2019s CEO, Giordano Albertazzi said:\n\n\u201cVertiv has collaborated with NVIDIA in research, development and engineering for multiple years, designing innovative products and solutions that support the deployment of NVIDIA technologies globally.\u201d\n\nHe further added:\n\n\u201cWe have combined our leadership in power and cooling solutions with NVIDIA\u2019s cutting-edge platforms to help meet the demands of the most compute-intensive applications and support the deployment of AI infrastructure across the globe. Now, we are collaborating to build state-of-the-art liquid cooling solutions for next-gen NVIDIA accelerated data centres powered by GB200 NVL72 systems.\u201d\n\nThe Non-AI Stock Cruising Through\n\nOver the last 5 years, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

DoorDash is a technology-driven marketplace that enables couriers (Dashers) to deliver restaurant and other local orders on-demand to consumers. The company is a market leader in restaurant delivery, a business that continues to gain US market share (with healthy margins) and grow internationally. At the same time, heavy investment in newer businesses has limited company profitability. Most notably, grocery delivery is a largely untapped market due to inventory management challenges (in-person grocery shopping involves a high degree of product substitution). This business unit has been losing money. However, the company believes it has a competitive cost advantage given its existing Dasher network, and continued growth will lead to profitability\u2014something it is not getting credit for by the market. The future near-term profit trajectory from new businesses is unclear, but we view management as very rational with its spending. Either these initiatives will yield additional profitable revenue streams, or they will be deprioritized in the coming years\u2014in both scenarios, we expect solid profit growth over time.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 Countries with the Largest Rural Population in the World 11 Hot Growth Stocks To Buy Right Now 10 Best Dividend Leaders to Buy According to Analysts\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 11 hot growth stocks to buy now. If you want to read about some more growth stocks that are active in the market, go directly to the 5Hot Growth Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nAs 2024 moves forward, the outlook for both the stock and bond markets undergoes regular fluctuations, influenced by various factors such as economic data releases, Federal Reserve communications, and changes in interest rate forecasts. As an example, the Federal Reserve hiked its benchmark interest rate 11 times from March 2022 to July 2023 amid resurgent inflation, reaching its highest level in more than two decades. This uptick in borrowing costs has contributed to alleviating inflationary pressures, with recent data showing consumer prices increasing by only 3.1% from January 2023, marking a decline from the peak of 9.1% in June 2022 and edging closer to the Fed's 2% target.\n\nSurprisingly, progress against inflation has been notable without inflicting significant economic hardship, with unemployment remaining below 4% for 24 consecutive months. Moreover, employers have consistently added an average of 244,000 jobs per month over the past year, with December and January seeing over 300,000 new jobs each. This combination of subdued inflation and GDP growth has fostered optimism that perhaps the Fed can achieve a rare \"soft landing.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the current year has an array of growth opportunities spanning different sectors within the capital markets. Leading the forefront is the technology sector, with artificial intelligence (AI) spearheading innovation. Its swift advancements and widespread integration across various industries render it an appealing option for investors pursuing growth and transformative prospects. As an illustration to this point, venture capital investments in generative AI and AI-related startups surged to nearly $50 billion the past year alone, with notable startups such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Inflection commanding substantial portions of these investments.\n\nFollowing suit is the healthcare sector, securing the second spot, as it progresses alongside developments in medical technologies and a growing emphasis on personalized medicine. The increasing demand for GLP-1, a medication class utilized in managing type 2 diabetes (T2D), is a key factor driving this trend. According to research by J.P. Morgan, the GLP-1 category is projected to surpass $100 billion by 2030, with growth attributed equally to its use in treating both diabetes and obesity.\n\nWhen it comes to stock selection for substantial returns in such times, focusing on growth stocks is a popular strategy. Growth stocks are characterized by higher share prices relative to their earnings per share, reflecting expectations of significant future growth. One metric commonly used to identify growth stocks is the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio). This ratio compares the current share price to the earnings per share, indicating the premium that the market is willing to pay for a stock's earnings potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of the notable companies included in our list of hot growth stocks to buy are Salesforce, Inc.

And while the progress of the metaverse gaming platform has certainly been impressive, it could still be in the earlier stages of growth.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Roblox had 71.5 million daily active users (DAUs) on its platform, 22% more than a year earlier. Management believes it could scale this to 1 billion DAUs over time, especially as wearable technology evolves and Roblox builds its presence in high-population international markets. The global metaverse market is expected to grow from $90 billion in 2023 to nearly $1 billion by 2030, and Roblox could be one of the biggest winners.\n\nRoblox is doing a great job of improving the efficiency of its business and expects to achieve positive free cash flow in 2024, and to expand margins by 100-300 basis points per year through at least 2027. Plus, management is doing a great job of finding new ways to monetize the platform, such as immersive advertising.\n\nOne of the biggest growth areas in the tech sector\n\nRenaissance Technology \u2013 the hedge find led by Jim Simons \u2013 has a $450 million stake in cybersecurity platform CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). And while AI has been the center of attention so far in 2024, cybersecurity remains a massive and long-tailed opportunity.\n\nCrowdStrike is a leader in cloud-based cybersecurity and was an early AI leader, using the technology to develop the best threat-detection capabilities on the market. And as the company grows, its capabilities get even stronger. After all, the company uses crowdsourced data (hence the name) to learn about and find security issues.\n\nCrowdStrike generates over $3.4 billion in annual recurring revenue today, but this could be just a starting point. Management sees a $100 billion addressable market opportunity for the business, but with the rapid growth and evolution of the cybersecurity industry, it believes that within the next few years, the market will grow to $225 billion in size and that CrowdStrike can achieve $10 billion in ARR by the end of this decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nA high-potential social media platform\n\nSocial media platform Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) is the largest technology stock owned by Paul Singer's Elliott Management, and by a wide margin.\n\nPinterest's business has been performing quite well recently, rebounding nicely from a growth slowdown after the pandemic-era surge subsided. The user base reached 498 million at the end of 2023, 11% more than a year prior, and the company was far more profitable with 86% year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter.\n\nThere are several promising growth avenues. CEO Bill Ready is relatively new in the role and has made some exciting moves to boost Pinterest's e-commerce potential. And it's also worth noting that while Pinterest makes the bulk of its money from North American users, international users actually make up about 80% of the total and have tons of monetization potential in the years ahead.\n\nThree high-potential businesses\n\nTo be sure, I'd never suggest investing in a particular stock just because a certain billionaire or hedge fund does. But these are three excellent businesses that have large addressable market opportunities, excellent leadership, and strong momentum, and they could be worth a closer look for your portfolio right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Roblox right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Roblox, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Roblox wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Growth stocks have the potential to outperform the stock market and help investors reach their long-term financial goals sooner. While higher yields and a desire to keep rates the same can dampen the mood in the short run, some growth stocks can deliver enticing long-term returns.\n\nInvestments with the potential to generate explosive returns are volatile in nature. You will have to endure sharp price movements from time to time. However, if these corporations continue to thrive with their growth initiatives, they can become some of the top picks in the stock market. Investors may want to monitor these promising investment opportunities.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is an educational tech stock that delivers impressive financial growth. The stock\u2019s only weakness is its lofty 126-forward P/E ratio. I do not have a position in this stock, but I welcome any short-term pullbacks that would make this stock more enticing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe stock is in the middle of a correction and has lost roughly 10% of its value since the start of April. It\u2019s a stock worth monitoring, and if it drops low enough, the stock can become a captivating buying opportunity. The business model is solid.\n\nRevenue increased by 45% year-over-year in\u00a0Q4 2023,\u00a0while net income came in at $12.1 million. That\u2019s a big switch from the company\u2019s $13.9 million net loss. Duolingo\u2019s net profit margin was above 8% compared to a 2% net profit margin in Q3 2023.\n\nThe difference is even more apparent with full-year results. Full-year 2023 net income came in at $16.1 million compared to a net loss of $59.6 million in the same period last year.\n\nUser growth rates also came in hot. Daily and monthly active users surged by 65% and 46% year-over-year respectively.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has comfortably outperformed the stock market with a 21% year-to-date gain. The cybersecurity firm continues to report impressive financial growth while many cybersecurity companies struggle to maintain last year\u2019s growth rates.\n\nThe firm generated $845.3 million in\u00a0Q4 FY24 revenue, a 33% year-over-year increase. Annual recurring revenue reached $3.44 billion, up 34% year-over-year. The company also had its fourth consecutive quarter of record GAAP profitability. GAAP net income came to $53.7 million compared to a $47.5 million GAAP net loss in the same period last year.\n\nThe stock has a\u00a078-forward P/E ratio but a more reasonable 1.34 PEG ratio. Value investors won\u2019t like this one, but the growth stock has the potential to outperform the market for a while. The company\u2019s guidance suggests that growth rates remain high, while other cybersecurity firms have reported the opposite. Crowdstrike looks poised to take market share from its competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has become a top choice for consumers who want healthier fast-food restaurants. The company reported 15.4% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 2023 and expanded its profit margins.\n\nThe company also expanded by opening 271 new restaurants with 28 locations, including Chipotle. While those numbers are good, Chipotle\u2019s guidance is even better. If everything goes according to plan, the company will have opened 285-315 restaurants in 2024.\n\nChipotle is still expanding, so it\u2019s not in the position to offer dividends quite yet. However, the company did initiate $589.8 million in stock buybacks with an average price per share of $1,827.46. The recent\u00a050-for-1 stock split announcement is also geared toward strengthening shareholder value.\n\nThe stock has outperformed the market with a 31% year-to-date gain and a 334% increase over the past five years. CMG stock is rated as a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d among 27 analysts and has a bunch of high price targets coming in.

        "title": "Got $5,000? 3 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term.",
        "content": "The tech industry has dominated stock-market gains for quite some time now, and it's been even more noticeable with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI). Because of the high-growth opportunities many tech companies provide, it makes sense why many growth-seeking investors go the tech route.\n\nRegardless of the opportunities that tech stocks offer, it's still important that investors keep a long-term mindset and not approach them expecting to get rich quickly.\n\nFor investors with $5,000 available to invest, the following three options are good long-term choices, and you can divide your money evenly among them. They each operate in different tech industries but are market leaders in their own right.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nFrom an online bookstore to a tech conglomerate, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is arguably the prime example of growth stocks in the tech industry. A $1,000 investment in Amazon at its May 1997 initial public offering (IPO) would be worth over $1.8 million today.\n\nAmazon rose to dominance because of its e-commerce business but has since become the leading cloud service provider with its platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's also made a mark in the entertainment industry with its Prime Video.\n\nE-commerce accounts for most of Amazon's revenue, but AWS is responsible for much of the company's profits. Both factors explain why the company is poised to be a force for the long haul. Regarding e-commerce, it's beginning to leverage its logistics network, which cost the company billions to develop, to generate new income streams with its Supply Chain by Amazon.\n\nSupply Chain by Amazon is a fully automated set of supply chain services that allow sellers to use the company's intricate logistics, warehousing, distribution, fulfillment capabilities, and transportation (including international). Being able to grow from its own e-commerce business to serve the broader e-commerce market will only strengthen Amazon's stronghold on the industry.\n\n2. CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) is one of the premier cybersecurity companies in the world and seems to be in the right place at the right time. The need for cybersecurity is increasing as the world becomes more digital.\n\nAccording to IBM's \"Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023,\" the average cost of a data breach globally is $4.45 million, and 51% of organizations plan to increase their cybersecurity spending as a result. That's just data breaches, too, but plenty of other cyberattacks can threaten a company's business.\n\nIBM's report also mentions that organizations which use AI and automation to fight this problem save $1.76 million, compared to organizations that don't. This works in CrowdStrike's favor, as the company is one of the pioneers of solely using AI to fight cyberattacks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's no doubt CrowdStrike's platforms are effective -- the business results speak for themselves. Around 27% of its clients use seven or more of the products in its ecosystem (called \"modules\"), 43% use six or more, and 64% use five or more. This has helped the company's free cash flow skyrocket during the past few years. CRWD Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nCrowdStrike can still cover a lot more ground in the cybersecurity industry. According to the company and market intelligence firm IDC, the AI-native cybersecurity market is estimated to grow from $100 billion this year to $225 billion by 2028. Of course, CrowdStrike won't capture all of it, but it's poised to be a company that benefits largely from this expected growth.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nDespite some well-documented public relations mishaps, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has been a gift to its investors over the past one-and-a-half years. The stock price is up over 450% since its November 2022 slump.\n\nThe owner of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger has positioned itself as a go-to platform for advertisers looking to get their products and services in front of the eyes of Meta's 3.98 billion month active users (MAUs). It's been working wonders for the company recently, too, with its financial health as good as it has ever been by many standards.\n\nMeta has always been a revenue cash cow, but recently, its net income has surged. In 2023, Meta's net income was over $39 billion, up 69% from 2022. META Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nMeta's net income growth relative to its revenue growth shows the company is beginning to operate more efficiently and use its capital more effectively. Meta declared a dividend in February for the first time in its history.\n\nThe company's quarterly dividend is $0.50 per share, and I think it wouldn't have started paying it at this point if it didn't intend to increase it annually. Meta is far from a dividend investor's dream, but it can be a true two-for-one for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The end of the first quarter means another volatile earnings season. United States equities ended Q1 on a high note after an overall positive Q4 earning season. The two major U.S. stock market indices \u2014 the S&P500 and the Nasdaq \u2014 ended the first quarter up 10.2% and 9.1%, respectively. The small-to-mid cap index, the Russell 2000, trailed behind, only having risen 4.8% for the first quarter. While positive earnings and market trends, such as the generative AI craze, may have been enough to lift stocks for earnings volatility to new heights, macroeconomic volatility has come back into view. Moreover, the high trading multiples U.S. equities have risen to has also led to a lot of selling pressure in Q2.\n\nYesterday, Jerome Powell mentioned because of persistent inflation, interest rates would be higher for a longer period of time. This level of macroeconomic uncertainty could bring heavy amounts of volatility to the coming earning season. In this article, I\u2019ll go through three stocks for earnings volatility.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity firm that specializes in cloud-based endpoint protection and threat intelligence services.\u00a0The company\u2019s Q4 earnings underscored how a cybersecurity firm could grow even during economic uncertainty. In particular, CrowdStrike beat earnings Wall Street estimates and saw top-line growth in 2023, reaching 54% on a year-over-year basis, while revenue for the quarter increased 45% year-over-year. Despite the cybersecurity industry as a whole struggling with growth, CrowdStrike has continued to significantly improve top-line figures year-over-year. The company has also avoided job cuts unlike companies like Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) and SentinelOne (NYSE:S).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCybersecurity is a space that is pretty sensitive to macroeconomic machinations. Once businesses feel the overall environment is cloud, they could delay or forgo any technological upgrades, which could slowdown business for companies like CrowdStrike. The cybersecurity firm has been able to blow past earnings estimates. For the company\u2019s Q4 2023 earnings report, CrowdStrike\u2019s revenue beat estimates modestly while its EPS was 15% higher than what analysts had been predicting, according to Koyfin. The firm\u2019s share skyrocketed more than 10% after its earnings release.\n\nGiven if the company beats estimates again and reiterates strong guidance, especially during times of uncertainty, CRWD shares could skyrocket again.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) logo on data network background, imaginary location in the future. Must-Buy Stocks on Major Deals\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is another option among stocks for earnings volatility. The data analytics firm released its AI Platform in the latter half of 2023, and subsequently, during the company\u2019s Q3 results, overall revenue increased 17% to $558 million from $478 million a year earlier. However, most notably, Palantir\u2019s \u201cU.S. Commercial business segment\u201d increased revenue figures by 37% on a year-over-basis driven by demand for Palantir\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Platform. The data analytics firm\u2019s AIP can deploy commercial and open-source large language models onto internally held data sets and, from there, recommend business processes and actions.\n\nThis next earnings season for Palantir will, no doubt, focus on AIP again. Analysts will be looking for any traction that product has gained from potential customers. The company beat estimates in its last earnings release, which sent the stock soaring to a record stock price.\n\nThe question is not only whether or not Palantir could blow away estimates but also if the market continues to accept Palantir\u2019s high stock-based compensation. In the company\u2019s Q4 report, for example, SBC came in at $132.6 million and was the largest add-back line-item to get the \u201cadjusted operating profit\u201d figure. Palantir\u2019s adjusted operating profit margin sat around 34% in Q4. If we count SBC as a\u00a0real expense, margins would have been around 11%. This is similar for its adjusted EBITDA figure.\n\nDue to these concerns, there could definitely be some earnings volatility on PLTR shares based on how analysts view the company\u2019s earnings figures.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo on a microchip. stocks for earnings volatility\n\nSource: Antonio Baccardi / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the preeminent designer of AI-powering graphics cards, will also likely receive a lot of earnings volatility. The chipmaker is by far the leader in the AI chip space, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Nvidia\u2019s chip design prowess and ample R&D expense, which was $7.3 billion in 2023 (27.2% of 2023 revenue) and has floated between 1/5 and 1/4 of revenue over the past few years, has allowed Nvidia to effectively snap up 81% of the market for AI chips. Nvidia\u2019s\u00a0new flagship processors dubbed \u201cBlackwell\u201d\u00a0will likely help Nvidia to maintain its lead against competitors.\n\nFor this earnings season, analysts will likely be focused on how Nvidia\u2019s revenue and EPS figures will stack up against current estimates. Guidance will also be a major factor. Given interest rates are to be higher for longer, I\u2019m sure analysts will be wondering if Nvidia\u2019s growth rate will be sustainable. NVDA\u2019s shares soared in double-digit territory and could do so again.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

Many cybersecurity firms that have dominated the stock market since the pandemic (and even before that point) have been losing momentum.\n\nEarnings misses, reduced guidance and frothy valuations fill the industry. This combination of factors makes it more difficult to find quality cybersecurity stock, especially pure plays. While many firms are experiencing slowdowns, the cybersecurity industry is here to stay.

A good compounded annual growth rate for the cybersecurity industry combined with weaknesses from its competitors suggests Crowdstrike can capitalize on the opportunity.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) was once a heralded cybersecurity stock until a recent earnings report dragged down the stock price. The stock is down by 3% year-to-date but has gained 240% over the past five years.\n\nRevenue grew by 19% year-over-year in\u00a0Q2 FY24,\u00a0a lower growth rate than previous quarters. The company had been generating 25% year-over-year revenue growth in previous quarters. Palo Alto Networks generated $135.5 million in income before income taxes during the quarter. Using this distinction is important since the company received a $1.6 billion benefit from income taxes. That\u2019s why the company has an inflated net income of $1.7 billion in GAAP, which isn\u2019t an accurate metric for gauging the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nIncome before income taxes increased from $118.8 million in Q2 FY23 to $135.5 million in the most recent quarter. That\u2019s a 14% year-over-year growth rate. The company anticipates revenue growth to range from 13% to 15% in Q3 FY24.\n\nThe big drop may present a long-term buying opportunity. The stock has an average rating of \u201cModerate Buy\u201d and an implied 20% upside. Recent post-earnings price targets have been mostly positive and indicate the stock can gain more than 20%.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up.

Most of the company\u2019s revenue comes from cloud computing. The platform helps businesses run more efficiently, but it\u2019s also a digital resource companies have to protect.\n\nThe tech giant has a suite of cybersecurity software and recently announced\u00a0Copilot for Security to gain more market share. This feature makes cybersecurity more accessible for individuals and small businesses. Copilot is the company\u2019s artificial intelligence tool that has many users. It\u2019s not just for cybersecurity; the company\u2019s recent innovation will increase Copilot\u2019s adoption.\n\nThe stock has outperformed the stock market for many years and is up 225% over the past five years. Analysts are bullish on the stock and believe it can\u00a0increase by 12% from current levels. The stock is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d by 35 analysts. Recent price target hikes suggest the stock can gain more than 12%. The highest price target of $550 per share implies a 30% gain.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in MSFT.

        "title": "CPI Ruins the Party: 3 High-Flying Stocks to Cash Out Of",
        "content": "United States equities have calmed down since their rally in the first quarter of 2024. The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 have all dipped slightly from their previous highpoints. While market trends, such as the generative AI craze, may have been enough to lift stocks to new heights, nowadays analysts and investors are increasingly worried about how stretched trading multiples have become. Today, we\u2019re analyzing the top stocks to sell on the CPI report.\n\nInflation also remains in the equation. Economists and market analysts expected there to be a downtick in the core consumer price index (CPI) figures for March. Instead, there was a month-to-month increase of 0.4% while the Y/Y rate for the core CPI remained at 3.8%. In other words, inflation seems here to stay for some time, which casts doubt on the Q2 rate cuts some analysts were hoping for. Persistent inflation and interest rates could prolong many companies cloudy business environments, potentially impacting high trading multiples.\n\nWithout further ado, below are stocks to sell on the CPI report before inflation and rate fears bring in more market turbulence.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSentinelOne (NYSE:S) is a global provider of cloud-based cybersecurity solutions, best-known for its \u2018Singularity Extended Detection and Response Platform\u2019. The concept leverages artificial intelligence to power cybersecurity solutions on an organization\u2019s cloud network.\n\nSingularity\u2019s value proposition was simple. AI technology would create a human-like experience for the platform\u2019s users, thus significantly decreasing upfront costs for customers. Addressing this pain-point in cybersecurity, SentinelOne roared into prominence with a record IPO and years of consecutive triple-digit revenue growth. In 2023, SentinelOne\u2019s share price rose more than 88%; of course, the AI craze had a lot to do with it. While SentinelOne\u2019s shares have had a decent run in Q1\u20192024, shares are down nearly 21% for the year.\n\nThe company\u2019s Q4 earnings report is partially to blame. While\u00a0financial figures did come in above Wall Street estimates, guidance for the company\u2019s following fiscal year was not sorely underwhelming. Intense competition from CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) which just seems to be snapping up market share is also a concern on investors\u2019 minds. Now with this hotter-than-expected CPI report, which could result in elevated interest rates for a long period of time, SentinelOne\u2019s growth prospects look even dimmer. Time to cash out now before more damage is done.\n\nStory continues\n\nRigetti Computing (RGTI) IBM Q System One Quantum Computer at the Consumer Electronic Show CES 2020.

To deliver its quantum computing capabilities to clients, Rigetti leverages cloud service networks while also providing quantum software development tools as well as quantum hardware design and manufacturing.\n\nWhile Rigetti\u00a0announced a successful Q4 2024 earnings period, which saw both revenue and earnings per share beat Wall Street estimates, the stock is also coming upon uncharted territory with interest rates likely being higher for longer. A startup like Rigetti needs ample access to equity and venture capital to sustain its losses. A company like this will find it difficult to obtain sizable loans. Still, access to equity capital could dry up even more if investors become more risk averse\n\nRGTI\u2019s shares have risen approximately 20% to around $1.18 per share from a year-to-date perspective but has plummeted over 46% from its high of $2.19 per share. Because quantum computing is still a pretty nascent field, investors are probably better of cashing out of this one, especially as the macroeconomic environment continues to be murky.\n\nCloudflare (NET) In this photo illustration a Cloudflare Inc (NET) logo is seen displayed on a smartphone. stocks to sell on the CPI report\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloudflare (NASDAQ:NET) hosts a massive Content Delivery Network or CDN that helps delivery continent to millions across the globe. For those unaware, Cloudflare\u2019s CDN is just a series of collocated servers wherein Cloudflare\u2019s customers can affordably store data. Accessing a favorite streaming service or\u00a0YouTube\u00a0channels becomes simpler with a CDN, or a \u201cdistributed network,\u201d that allows users to quickly pull up a video or any other piece of content from the closest server.\n\nCloudflare has provides a security apparatus to websites. If you have ever accessed a website and had a virtual private network (VPN) on, perhaps you had a Cloudflare pop-up window verifying if you were a \u201creal human.\u201d In other words, the Cloudflare CDN also protects customers\u2019 content from malware and other intrusive attempts so that websites do not have to build out that security infrastructure on their own.\n\nThe CDN company\u2019s shares have done well in 2024, rising 13% on a year-to-date basis. At one point in the year, NET\u2019s share price had risen almost 30% after its Q4 report blew past Wall Street estimates. However, Cloudflare clearly isn\u2019t immune to the machinations in the macro environment and broader equities market. Its insanely high valuation as well as the uncertainty around how higher rates for longer will affect its business growth have sent shares plummeting 13% from its all-time high. Similar to the others in the list, probably now is a good time to accept your gains and accept NET as one of the stocks to sell on the CPI report.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "Australia\u2019s largest business bank partners with the global cybersecurity leader to deliver security with the speed, expertise and flexibility customers need to stop breaches\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, April 16, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD) today announced a strategic partnership with National Australia Bank (NAB), Australia\u2019s largest business bank. NAB is providing one year of complimentary access to CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Go - the industry\u2019s leading AI-powered cybersecurity protection for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).\n\nAccording to the CrowdStrike 2024 Global Threat Report, the financial services industry continues to be heavily targeted by eCrime threat actors. In addition, SMBs are uniquely at risk when it comes to cyberattacks, as 60% of SMBs that suffer a data breach go out of business within six months of the attack. SMBs often lack the resources, technical expertise and mature security infrastructure that large organizations use to defend against modern threats.\n\nNAB is building in customer protection by providing access to CrowdStrike Falcon Go for its SMB customers. Falcon Go includes next-generation antivirus (NGAV) and device control for USB device protection, which is AI-powered by a single, lightweight agent that\u2019s easy to deploy and manage for smaller organizations.\n\n\"The number of cyber attacks impacting small businesses continues to grow year on year, and our research tells us small and medium businesses are one of the least cyber prepared sectors. As Australia\u2019s leading business bank, we have an important role to play to help educate and assist the small and medium-sized businesses that bank with us to ensure they remain secure,\" said NAB Chief Security Officer, Sandro Bucchianeri. \"By working with CrowdStrike, we\u2019re looking to connect customers with some of the best and most trusted cyber defenses. We\u2019re urging all businesses to evaluate their security before it\u2019s too late.\"\n\n\"CrowdStrike Falcon Go is AI-powered and purpose-built to bring modern cybersecurity to smaller businesses. It\u2019s easy to use and stops breaches,\" said Daniel Bernard, chief business officer for CrowdStrike. \"For NAB to recognise the need to help educate and protect its customers is both innovative and responsible. At CrowdStrike, we talk about cybersecurity being a team sport, and this initiative from NAB is a quintessential example of that in practice, raising the cybersecurity bar for small and medium-sized businesses across Australia and the region.\"\n\nFurther information about CrowdStrike Falcon Go and how CrowdStrike works with SMBs is available on the CrowdStrike website.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout CrowdStrike CrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, has redefined modern security with the world\u2019s most advanced cloud-native platform for protecting critical areas of enterprise risk \u2013 endpoints and cloud workloads, identity and data.\n\nPowered by the CrowdStrike\u00ae Security Cloud and world-class AI, the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae platform leverages real-time indicators of attack, threat intelligence, evolving adversary tradecraft and enriched telemetry from across the enterprise to deliver hyper-accurate detections, automated protection and remediation, elite threat hunting and prioritized observability of vulnerabilities.\n\nPurpose-built in the cloud with a single lightweight-agent architecture, the Falcon platform delivers rapid and scalable deployment, superior protection and performance, reduced complexity and immediate time-to-value.\n\nCrowdStrike: We stop breaches.\r\nLearn more: https://www.crowdstrike.com/ \r\nFollow us: Blog | Twitter | LinkedIn | Facebook | Instagram \r\nStart a free trial today: https://www.crowdstrike.com/free-trial-guide/\n\n\u00a9 2024 CrowdStrike, Inc.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks With More Upside to Buy Now, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the technology landscape. Its potential to improve productivity recently led JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon to write, \"We are completely convinced the consequences will be extraordinary and possibly as transformative as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years.\" He specifically mentioned the discovery of electricity and the invention of the internet.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, investors have been ploughing money into chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), a sensible move given that its graphics processing units \"underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%,\" according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nHowever, Nvidia shares have soared 480% since the beginning of 2023, and Wall Street analysts now see more upside in other AI stocks like CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) and Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW). The median price estimates (and the implied upside) for those companies are as follows:\n\nNvidia: $976.95 per share (15% upside). CrowdStrike: $400 per share (29% upside). Snowflake: $210 per share (36% upside).\n\nHere's what investors should know about CrowdStrike and Snowflake.\n\n1. CrowdStrike\n\nCybersecurity specialist CrowdStrike delivered solid financial results in the fourth quarter. Sales increased 33% to $845 million and non-GAAP net income more than doubled to hit $0.95 per diluted share. The company also reported a gross retention rate of 98%, indicating that it kept the vast majority of its customers. Investors can expect similar momentum in the future.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley recently noted that CrowdStrike was one of only three enterprise software companies to guide for sales growth exceeding 30% this year. That speaks to the pressing demand for cybersecurity software that is both effective and operationally efficient. CrowdStrike checks both boxes. It is the market leader in endpoint security, one of the largest and fastest-growing market segments, and it's gaining share in other categories.\n\nSpecifically, in the fourth quarter, the company reported record revenue from its identity protection, cloud security, and security information and event management (SIEM) products. Management also highlighted early momentum with its data protection and IT operations modules.\n\nI mention those products not only to explain the clout CrowdStrike has achieved, but also to highlight the breadth of its platform. Many enterprises rely on more than 60 security point products, according to CEO George Kurtz, so vendor consolidation has become a top priority. Using products from vendors typically translates into greater efficiency, simply because there are fewer systems to maintain, and CrowdStrike is ideally positioned to capitalize on that trend.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, CrowdStrike has earned a reputation for industry-leading threat protection, in part because of excellence in artificial intelligence (AI). Kurtz recently told analysts that CrowdStrike has the \"most effective and accurate AI models.\" That comment echoes what Frost & Sullivan analysts wrote in 2022: \"CrowdStrike leads the industry with regard to the application of artificial intelligence/machine learning to endpoint security, as well as providing unparalleled prevention of malware and malware-free attacks.\"\n\nNotably, CrowdStrike ranked No. 3 on the Fortune Future 50 list in 2023, an annual assessment of the world's largest companies based on long-term growth prospects. Wall Street expects the company to grow sales at 29% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 24.7 times sales seem reasonable. Investors should consider buying a small position in this growth stock today.\n\n2. Snowflake\n\nData analytics specialist Snowflake reported solid financial results in the fourth quarter. Its customer count rose 22% and the average existing customer spent 31% more. In turn, revenue increased 32% to $775 million and non-GAAP net income more than doubled to reach $0.35 per diluted share. But guidance narrowly missed expectations and CEO Frank Slootman announced his retirement. That alarmed investors and caused shares to tumble 20% following the report.\n\nHowever, the investment thesis remains unchanged. The Snowflake Data Cloud consolidates workloads, such that clients can store and analyze information, develop and manage machine learning models, and build data-driven applications from a single platform. The platform also runs across all three major public clouds, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. None of those vendors afford customers the same flexibility.\n\nCollectively, Snowflake has earned a strong market presence due to its ability to consolidate workloads and support multiple clouds. Indeed, Forrester Research recently recognized its leadership among cloud data warehousing platforms, noting that Snowflake has outpaced its peers in terms of innovation. Snowflake also ranked No. 1 on the Fortune Future 50 List for 2023.\n\nOne particularly exciting growth opportunity is artificial intelligence. To quote new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy, \"Data is the fuel for AI, making it essential to establishing an effective AI strategy.\" Snowflake recently announced Cortex, a service that lets clients develop generative and predictive AI applications on its platform. Cortex includes large language models for translation, sentiment detection, and text summarization, as well as machine learning models for forecasting, anomaly detection, and data classification, all of which streamline the creation of AI applications.\n\nGoing forward, the data analytics market is forecasted to grow at 27% annually through 2030. Wall Street analysts believe that tailwind will drive sales growth of 25% annually for Snowflake. Against that consensus estimate, the current valuation of 18.1 times sales seems reasonable. To add context, Snowflake is essentially trading at its cheapest price-to-sales multiple in history, which arguably means there has never been a better time to buy this growth stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 13 best machine learning stocks to invest in. To skip the detailed analysis of the machine learning industry, go directly to the 5 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In.\n\nThe concepts of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are often used interchangeably. However, that is not the case as machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on teaching computers to learn from data, make predictions, and automate tasks without explicit programming. On the other hand, artificial intelligence includes a broader range of techniques that aim to create systems capable of human-like intelligence, such as autonomous vehicles and robots. According to a report by Precedence Research, the global AI market was valued at $454 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% between 2023 and 2032, reaching $2.575 trillion by the end of the forecasted period. Precedence Research estimated machine learning's market value at $38.11 billion in 2022 and expects it to reach $771.38 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 35.09% over the projected period, between 2023 and 2032.\n\nCompanies Leveraging Machine Learning\n\nWhile there are a handful of companies that are actively working on developing products toward the advancement of machine learning, there are many companies that depend on machine learning technology to run their operations. For example, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) leverages machine learning to influence content creation decisions and personalize the user interface. Moreover, the company\u2019s recommendation system uses ML to analyze user behavior and provide personalized content suggestions. Netflix, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:NFLX) ability to deliver tailored content experiences to its subscribers drives user retention and platform growth. The company made the following comments in one of its articles:\n\n\u201cAt Netflix, the Machine Learning Platform (MLP) team has been investing in research to push the boundaries of ML Performance over the years. Our state-of-the-art ML performance infrastructure serves as a strong foundation to leverage the latest research in Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Data Infrastructure, GPU Memory Management, Graph Neural Networks, and more recently Large Language Models. We are building an increasingly active engagement with Academia and have a quickly growing graduate ML Internship program that brings us both new talent & the latest research, providing a bridge between university labs and fast-growing industry applications.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe financial services institution, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has been using AI/ML for over a decade. In the company\u2019s 2023 annual letter to shareholders, its chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon said that the company now has over 2,000 AI/ML experts and data scientists. Dimon considers AI an \u201cextraordinary\u201d technology and believes that it is \u201cas transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years\u201d such as electricity and the internet. He said:\n\n\u201cWe have been actively using predictive AI and ML for years \u2014 and now have over 400 use cases in production in areas such as marketing, fraud and risk \u2014 and they are increasingly driving real business value across our businesses and functions. We're also exploring the potential that generative AI (GenAI) can unlock across a range of domains, most notably in software engineering, customer service and operations, as well as in general employee productivity. In the future, we envision GenAI helping us reimagine entire business workflows. We will continue to experiment with these AI and ML capabilities and implement solutions in a safe, responsible way.\n\nWhile we are investing more money in our AI capabilities, many of these projects pay for themselves. Over time, we anticipate that our use of AI has the potential to augment virtually every job, as well as impact our workforce composition. It may reduce certain job categories or roles, but it may create others as well. As we have in the past, we will aggressively retrain and redeploy our talent to make sure we are taking care of our employees if they are affected by this trend.\u201d\n\nHe further added that the organization understands the importance of AI and for that reason, it has created a new position, chief data and analytics officer.\n\nCompeting With Nvidia in the AI Space\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) took the markets by storm and was the top-performing Magnificent 7 stock in 2023, gaining nearly 240%. The surge was attributed to limited competition in the AI accelerator market. However, other companies have been making strides to take over NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominance such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). On April 9, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) unveiled its new AI chip, Gaudi 3. According to the company, the chip is \u201cpurpose-built for high-performance, high-efficiency GenAI compute\u201d. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) claims that compared to NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100, Gaudi 3 is much more power-efficient and faster.\n\nOn April 10, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) introduced its new Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), an upgrade to MTIA v1 that was introduced last year. The chip has been designed for Meta Platforms, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) in-house AI workloads, and to decrease its dependency on NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. The new MTIA version more than doubled the compute and memory bandwidth while maintaining a focus on efficiently serving recommendation models. According to the company, MTIA is part of its long-term plan to build a strong and efficient infrastructure for handling its AI tasks.\n\nWith the above information in mind, some of the best machine learning stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). 13 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In\n\nA researcher studying a machine learning model of a metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through internet rankings of AI stocks and ML stocks, including our own, in addition to the holdings of Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ), iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (IRBO), and Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) to come up with 25 potential ML stocks. We then looked into each company's products and services to further refine our list to include AI companies that are actively working toward the development and advancement of machine learning. We narrowed down our selection to 13 stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 of 2023.\n\nThe hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In\n\n13. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 48\n\nBaidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is engaged in machine learning through its research division, Baidu Research, and products, including Baidu Machine Learning (BML) and a deep-learning framework, PaddlePaddle.

(NASDAQ:BIDU), with total positions worth $1.715 billion. With nearly 2.2 million shares worth $260.436 million, Alkeon Capital Management is the biggest shareholder in the company, as of Q4 2023.\n\nBaidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is one of the best machine-learning stocks to invest in. Other such stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nAriel Investments stated the following regarding Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cBy comparison, China\u2019s internet search and online community leader, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) traded lower alongside Chinese equities as intensifying problems in China weighed on investor sentiment during the period. The company continues to invest heavily in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and recently launched its generative AI, Ernie Bot, aimed at rivaling Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT. While monetization of the new technology is largely dependent on regulatory review, we think Baidu should continue to experience margin improvement with the ongoing implementation of efficiency and profitability initiatives. While some investors remain on the sidelines due to uncertainty surrounding China\u2019s economic growth, government regulations, and the political rhetoric towards Taiwan, we remain enthusiastic about Baidu\u2019s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.\u201d\n\n12.

Intel is benefitting from the near-term rebound in semiconductor demand driven by the cyclical recovery of personal computers (PCs) and central processing units (CPUs).

We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel\u2019s. We invested on the the belief that AMD\u2019s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD\u2019s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 Major Cities with the Highest Home Price Increases Since the Pandemic Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks 10 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at\u00a0Latest Insider Selling in April 2024: 1 Stocks to Watch. For a quick overview of the 5 such stocks, read our article Latest Insider Selling in April 2024: 5 Stocks to Watch.\n\nWall Street analysts and wise investors often keep a close eye on insider buying and selling, since academic research has time and again proved that insiders often act as opportunists and make use of insider information while conducting insider transactions. This is especially true for insider purchases, as we have discussed the relevant academic research recently. But what about insider selling? While many believe insider selling is not predictive of anything substantial, there are a few angles in insider selling activity which should not be ignored as they might provide something of value for long-term investors.\n\nWhen Should You Pay Attention to Insider Selling?\n\nBen Silverman, director of research at Verity, in his podcast entitled Things All Investors Should Know About Insider Selling, said that there are certain kinds of insider selling activities which are worthy of investors\u2019 attention. Silverman specifically advised investors not to overlook insider selling transactions conducted under the Rule 10b5-1, which allows insiders to sell their company shares by delineating a specific plan, which mentions stock price, amount and transaction date in advance. The analyst said that there has been a misconception in the industry that insider selling under the Rule 10b5-1 is of \u201cvanilla nature\u201d and does not show \u201copportunistic\u201d tendencies of insiders. Silverman believes some insiders have been using this rule to \u201csell opportunistically\u201d and some of them have been \u201cvery smart about it.\u201d\n\nImportant Insider Selling of 2024: Mark Zuckerberg Selling Meta Platforms\n\nOne of the examples of such transactions, according to Silverman, is Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s selling Meta Platforms shares under the rule. Zuckerberg started selling Meta Platforms shares last year. He kept selling the stock almost daily, following a pattern. But Silverman said the size of Zuckerberg\u2019s selling increased significantly in February 2024 when the social media company\u2019s shares jumped. Silverman said Meta Platforms co-founder had adopted the Rule 10b5-1 back in July 2023, and at that time he didn\u2019t know at what price Meta shares would be trading in February at 2024.\n\n\"But he did have the foresight to prepare for it by setting up Rule 10b5-1 to accelerate selling at certain prices,\" Silverman added.\n\nHowever, Silverman did say that since companies offer special stock options annually to their executives, insiders usually do not need to worry about their company stock price while selling it. Silverman said insiders can often build up \u201cenormous equity exposure\u201d easily.\n\nStory continues\n\nSilverman\u2019s point regarding insider selling is also backed by academic research. In a paper titled Insider Trading: Frequency Matters, researchers talked about how many insiders use informational advantage while selling shares under the Rule10b5-1. Here is an important excerpt from the study:\n\n\"One US example involves selling shares through preprogrammed 10b5-1 plans, a process that on its face might suggest an orderly series of sales over time, but in reality, is often designed to facilitate large sales at the first opportunity. There is evidence that 10b5-1 preprogrammed selling occurs disproportionately before negative earnings surprises (Jagolinzer, 2008) and can predict share price decline more than insider sales in general (Milian, 2016). Other studies find that selling insiders sometimes appear to work subtly with analysts around the timing of earnings revisions (Richardson, Teoh, & Wysocki, 2004), or otherwise massage earnings accrual information (Kraft, Lee, & Lopatta, 2014), or the timing of share repurchases (Bonaime & Ryngaert, 2013) and earnings restatements (Agrawal & Cooper, 2015) to support a stock price before a sale. There is also evidence that insiders sell well in advance of a default (Beneish, Press, & Vargas, 2012) or bankruptcy (Iqbal & Shetty, 2002), or alternatively, reduce selling ahead of receiving a takeover bid (Agrawal & Nasser, 2012). Not every subtle exit strategy involves selling; informationally motivated share disposal occurs through prepaid forward contracts (Jagolinzer, Matsunaga, & Young, 2007) and large charitable gifts (Yermack, 2009).\"\n\nWhich Sectors and Industries are Seeing Insider Selling in 2024?\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s analysis shows that since April 10 through April 15, insiders were dumping technology stocks since the sector had the heaviest concentration of insider selling activity in the period. In 2024, February saw the highest insider selling activity, with insiders dumping about $6.4 billion worth of shares in the month, according to data from CNBC.\u00a0 Software and Services saw the heaviest insider selling recently, followed by Biotechnology and Gas, according to CNBC. Latest Insider Selling in April 2024: 10 Stocks to Watch\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s monthly newsletter and\u00a0portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs\u2019 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.\n\nFor this article we used Insider Monkey's insider trading screener to find stocks that saw heavy insider selling in April through April 8. From these companies we chose 10 stocks with the highest insider selling activity in terms of dollar value. Some top names in the list include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),\u00a0 Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and\u00a0 Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD).\n\n10. Starwood Property Trust Inc (NYSE:STWD) [Parent company: Starwood Capital Group]\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nStarwood Property Trust Inc (NYSE:STWD) ranks 10th in our list of the stocks insiders are selling these days. Barry S. Sternlicht, a director at Starwood Property Trust Inc (NYSE:STWD), on April 1 sold 973,000 shares of the REIT at $23.08 per share. In addition to Starwood, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),\u00a0 Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and\u00a0 Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) also saw insider selling in April.\n\n9. nCino Inc (NASDAQ:NCNO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nFinancial technology solutions company nCino Inc (NASDAQ:NCNO) shares have gained about 43% over the past one year. The stock recently saw insider selling activity as Insight Holdings Group, LLC., which has a director and 10% stake owner status at nCino Inc (NASDAQ:NCNO), sold 1,031,659 company shares at $35.20 per share on April 1. Since then the stock is down 3.22%. Another director at nCino\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:NCNO), Jeff Horing also sold 5.1 million shares of nCino\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:NCNO)\u00a0at $35.20 per share on April 1.\n\nBaron Small Cap Fund stated the following regarding NCino, Inc. (NASDAQ:NCNO) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThis quarter we initiated a position in\u00a0NCino, Inc. (NASDAQ:NCNO), a leading provider of cloud-based banking software that was founded in 2012. The company\u2019s platform helps more than 1,850 global financial institutions modernize their processes around client onboarding and account opening, making loans, and managing loans after they have been originated. NCino\u2019s solutions support a large majority of customers at a financial institution, including commercial, small business, consumer, and mortgage customers.\n\nNCino operates in a large market \u2013 the addressable market is approximately $10 billion in the Americas and $18.5 billion on a global basis \u2013 and has achieved high levels of customer satisfaction as evidenced by a strong net promoter score of 74 and very little voluntary churn. The company\u2019s solutions are deeply embedded in customer workflows and generate a strong return on investment in the form higher revenue from more loans, lower costs from a reduction in paper-based processes, faster decision making, and improved efficiency with the ability to consolidate several legacy systems. Relative to the competition, nCino\u2019s solution has several advantages, including operating a cloud-native single platform (built on top of Salesforce) that is free from legacy tech debt, having a well-known brand that is highly regarded in the marketplace (especially strong in commercial banking), and a long history of successful deployments with an impressive roster of customers (institutions like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Barclays, Fifth Third, and many others) who can then serve as reference accounts.\n\nNCino is well positioned to drive mid-teens or greater organic revenue growth for many years driven by a combination of growth with existing clients (even within its large U.S. customers, we estimate that nCino is only around mid-20% penetrated today), increasing penetration of nIQ (data analytics and machine learning products), continuing to win new commercial clients, gaining traction in newer end-markets like consumer loans and mortgages, and ramping its international expansion. The company is already seeing good success in the U.K., Canada, New Zealand, Japan, and several countries in continental Europe. The company has also started to ramp its margin profile, but we see a path for additional margin expansion from the low double-digit range today up to 30% to 35% operating margins over time. We believe there is a long runway for profitable growth for nCino, as banks and other financial institutions choose it as a partner to help digitize and transition to the cloud.\u201d\n\n8. Ares Management Corp (NYSE:ARES)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\n\nAres Management Corp (NYSE:ARES) ranks eighth in our list of the stocks insiders are selling.

        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this cloud-based security company have returned -2.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which CrowdStrike falls in, has lost 0.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.89 per share, indicating a change of +56.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.90 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +26.2%. This estimate has changed +1.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.80 indicates a change of +22.9% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CrowdStrike.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate of $904.93 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +30.7%. The $3.97 billion and $4.97 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +29.8% and +25.4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $845.34 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +32.6%. EPS of $0.95 for the same period compares with $0.47 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $839.08 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.75%. The EPS surprise was +15.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 7 Nasdaq Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for April 2024",
        "content": "When it comes to Nasdaq stocks with strong buy ratings, mega-cap tech stocks may be what may first come to mind. To some extent, this is a correct assumption. Wall Street\u2019s analyst community has issued \u201cstrong buy\u201d or \u201coverweight\u201d ratings on quite a few of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks.\n\nThat said, these aren\u2019t the only Nasdaq-listed names sell-siders are bullish on right now. Many large-cap tech names have also received similarly high marks from sell-side analysts over the past few months.\n\nMoreover, remember that while heavily associated with tech stocks, scores of non-tech stocks across all sectors also trade on the Nasdaq exchange. Plenty of these names have also garnered a \u201cstrong buy\u201d or \u201coverweight\u201d ratings since the start of the year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe accuracy of sell-side ratings has long been subject to debate. It may be worth taking a look at these lauded Nasdaq stocks, such as the following seven.\n\nAcademy Sports and Outdoors (ASO) Woman at the supermarket checkout, she is paying using a credit card, shopping and retail concept\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAcademy Sports and Outdoors (NASDAQ:ASO) is a sporting goods retailer, with stores located primarily in Texas, as well as across the southern and midwestern United States. Last year, I pointed out ASO as being one of the undervalued Nasdaq stocks.\n\nASO stock has traded sideways since then. Recent fiscal results and guidance from the company have fallen short of expectations. Yet while I\u2019m more skeptical about the stock than before, one sell-side analyst remains very bullish. Last August, Telsey Advisory Group initiated coverage of Academy Sports and Outdoors stock.\n\nGiving ASO an \u201coutperform\u201d rating,\u201d and a $72 per share price target, Telsey cited the potential for Academy to \u201creturn to growth\u201d during 2024. The analyst firm has twice reiterated its \u201coutperform\u201d rating. Telsey raised its price target in the first reiteration to $83 per share, but lowered in the second reiteration to $75 per share.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\n\u201cAI mania\u201d has been a boon for tech stocks across the board, and Crowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock is no exception. Shares in the cybersecurity solutions firm have rallied by a staggering 144.73% over the past year.\n\nWhile many other large and mega-cap Nasdaq stocks have outperformed it during this time frame, these massive gains for CRWD stock are nothing to sneeze at. That said, following this massive run-up, Crowdstrike shares have become pricey. Right now, CRWD trades for 81.1 times forward earnings.\n\nBut while this may have the valuation-conscious leery about entering a position, keep in mind that analysts at Raymond James have yet to reiterate or change an \u201coutperform\u201d rating on CRWD, issued in January.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe same goes for analysts at Bernstein, who also issued an \u201coutperform\u201d rating on the stock at that time. This could change, however, after Crowdstike next reports earnings, sometime next month.\n\nEast West Bancorp (EWBC) Image of a grey cityscape with a large corporate building that features the word bank on it\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEast West Bancorp (NASDAQ:EWBC) is a California-based regional bank, focused on providing personal and business banking services to the Chinese-American community.\n\nRegional banks have contended with many challenges lately, but based on a recent sell-side rating, EWBC has been one of the more resilient names in the space.\n\nLast month, Barclays analyst Jared Shaw issued an \u201coverweight\u201d rating on EWBC stock, giving it a $106 per share price target. In his bullish assessment, Shaw cited management\u2019s strong execution. Per the analyst, East West Bancorp has continued to increase its deposits and loan, all while maintaining \u201cexcellent credit underwriting\u201d and staying well-capitalized.\n\nWith EWBC trading for around $74 per share today, reaching Shaw\u2019s price target may seem like a tall order.\n\nHowever, if the bank\u2019s strengths persist, macro conditions improve, and sentiment for regional bank stocks shift back to bullish, shares could hit this price target sooner than you think.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou probably don\u2019t find it surprising that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the Nasdaq stocks getting a lot of love from the analyst community right now.\n\nThe software giant has so far been one of the early-movers in generative artificial intelligence technology. Because of this, the strong buy ratings keep coming in.\n\nFor instance, on March 20, Keybanc issued an \u201coverweight\u201d rating, and a $490 per share price target, on MSFT stock. In their view, \u201cMicrosoft sits in the catbird seat in two of the three main ways software vendors can monetize the AI wave.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not all. On April 11, Morgan Stanley reiterated its \u201coutperform\u201d rating on MSFT, raising its price target to $520 per share. In the sell-side firm\u2019s view, Microsoft\u2019s lead position in cloud computing and gen AI points to annual earnings doubling to $29 per share by 2029.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is another \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d component that\u2019s still earning top grades from Wall Street analysts.\n\nWith the cool down in \u201cAI mania,\u201d investors have also cooled down in their excitement for this leading AI chip designer.\n\nThe next big move for NVDA stock may be just around the corner.. The company is expected to report earnings sometime next month. That said, if you\u2019ve been thinking about exiting a NVDA position, a look at the latest sell-side commentary on Nvidia could change your view.\n\nLast week, Raymond James\u2019 Srini Pajjuri maintained his \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating on Nvidia, and raised his price target from $850 to $1000 per share. Pajjuri believes concerns about a slowdown in AI chip sales are \u201cunwarranted,\u201d given demand still exceeds supply.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley have also recently raised their NVDA price target to $1000 per share, as InvestorPlace\u2019s Larry Ramer discussed on April 11.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectronic design automation company Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is another of the Nasdaq stocks that have recently received a \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating or the equivalent to a \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating from analysts.\n\nOn April 4, Piper Sandler\u2019s Clarke Jeffries issued an \u201coverweight\u201d rating, and a $665 per share price target, on SNPS stock. In the research note, the analyst cited several factors driving this bullish view on shares.\n\nFirst, Jeffries pointed out that the company has sustained strong levels of annualized revenue growth. Alongside this, Synopsys\u2019 margins have improved considerably over the past five years.\n\nBesides the strong performance of its underlying business, the analyst also believes acquisitions and divestitures are also a catalyst for SNPS.\n\nThe company\u2019s pending purchase of Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) is poised to be accretive to shareholders. Synopsys\u2019 sale of its Software Integrity Group segment stands to be a major positive for further margin expansion.\n\nWeatherford International (WFRD) Oil. 3D Illustration. Oil stocks are up.\n\nSource: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn February 28, Barclays\u2019 J. David Anderson issued an \u201coverweight\u201d rating, and a $135 per share price target, on Weatherford International (NASDAQ:WFRD). At the time, this oil equipment and services company was trading for just over $100 per share.\n\nWFRD stock has since climbed to $120 per share, but if you decide to take heed of this analyst recommendation, upside may be more substantial than you think.\n\nIn the Barclays research note, Anderson argued that the key factor pointing to higher prices for Weatherford was the company\u2019s continued implementation of cost cutting and other efficiency measures.\n\nHowever, couple this with a recent positive development for the energy sector. That would be the latest surge in oil prices. With oil demand outpacing expectations, exploration efforts could rise as well.\n\nThis could further boost demand for Weatherford\u2019s products and services. Hence, giving shares an organic growth catalyst, alongside a turnaround catalyst.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget the \"Fab Four\": These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Magnificent Buys Today",
        "content": "In the current bull market, a handful of technology companies are dominating the action on Wall Street. This group became known as the \"Magnificent Seven.\" In 2024, some of those seven names are falling behind. Today, the remaining resilient high-flyers -- Nvidia, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft -- are referred to by some as the \"Fab Four.\"\n\nNow might not be the time to continue piling into those same few winners. After all, they are sitting on huge gains already. Instead, three Motley Fool contributors think you might want to consider shaking things up with a fallen angel like Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA), an up-and-comer like CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), or even a lottery ticket-like stock such as Lemonade(NYSE: LMND).\n\nAI could take beleaguered Tesla stock into overdrive\n\nWill Healy(Tesla): One way to find affordable artificial intelligence (AI) stocks is to look for companies that have fallen out of favor for other reasons than their AI connections. Tesla fits that description. The company sold about 11% fewer electric vehicles (EVs) than it built in the first quarter, and rumors that it had canceled its plans for a lower-cost Model 2 have also weighed on the stock.\n\nIndeed, EV sales could continue to suffer in the near term. However, Tesla has recently made improvements to its AI-powered full self-driving platform, and CEO Elon Musk has announced that it will unveil its robotaxi on Aug. 8. It was primarily on the prospects inherent in this robotaxi that Cathie Wood's Ark Invest based its forecast that Tesla shares will hit $2,000 by 2027.\n\nArk Invest sees Tesla as a robotics stock, and believes the robotaxi will drive both sales for Tesla vehicles and the software-as-a-service platform powering the robotaxi. The investment management firm believes robotaxis will account for 67% of the company's expected enterprise value by 2027. That would dramatically transform the company as automotive sales provided 85% of its revenue in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, considering that the target is for a more than tenfold increase in the stock price by 2027, many investors are skeptical. However, it's worth noting that in 2018, Ark Invest predicted that Tesla stock would reach $267 per share by 2021. That prediction, too, was for almost a 10-fold increase at the time -- and it came true in the 2021 bull market.\n\nEven if Ark Invest's optimistic prediction falls short, investors have some cushion. After its recent sell-off, Tesla's P/E ratio is around 40 -- near a record low for the stock.\n\nUltimately, that valuation should rise, assuming a robust robotaxi platform significantly boosts revenue and earnings. Hence, Tesla could experience a massive rebound as it self-drives its way back into investor portfolios.\n\nCrowdStrike is on the cusp of great things\n\nJake Lerch (CrowdStrike): CrowdStrike is a leader in cybersecurity solutions -- a field of growing importance given the seemingly endless number of cyberattacks the world continues to witness. Consider just one -- the Change Healthcare hack, which crippled claims payments for tens of thousands of healthcare providers in recent weeks. Recognizing the steep costs of falling victim to such cyberattacks, many organizations are eager to stiffen their digital defenses.\n\nCrowdStrike, whose software relies on machine learning to monitor client networks and identify suspicious before damage is done, is gaining new clients rapidly.\n\nIn its most recent fiscal quarter (which ended on Jan. 31), CrowdStrike's revenue rose 33% year over year to $845 million. Moreover, $796 million of that, or 94%, was subscription revenue. That's important as subscription revenue is recurring, meaning it is more predictable than traditional sales, which tend to experience greater ups and downs.\n\nIn addition, CrowdStrike is making a key transition in its life cycle: It's becoming profitable. Its net income recently turned positive for the first time. The company has generated $89 million in net income over the last 12 months. What's more, free cash flow has soared to $3.81 a share. That's critical, as rising free cash flow per share is cited by many as the ultimate financial measure of success for a public company -- and is often correlated with long-term stock price gains.  CRWD Net Income (TTM) Chart\n\nIn short, CrowdStrike is the best of both worlds. It's a young company with growing free cash flow that is making the transition to consistent profitability. It's also riding a secular growth trend as more organizations upgrade and strengthen their cyber defenses in the face of increasing danger. For those reasons, it's a stock worth considering.\n\nLemonade's AI offers a new spin on insurance\n\nJustin Pope (Lemonade): Insurance is an age-old industry ripe for disruption. The incumbents -- the humongous insurance companies whose names you know, the ones that do all the commercials with pro athletes, funny mascots, and recognizable spokespeople -- do use AI to analyze data. However, they still sell policies through an agent model, which has given Lemonade enough opportunity to break into the market. Lemonade uses AI chatbots to communicate with customers and process claims. These bots can complete tasks in as little as 90 seconds and get a claim paid in under three minutes. You might sit on hold longer than that, waiting to speak with an agent at a traditional insurance company.\n\nLemonade's app-first experience has won over many customers. Its customer count grew 12% year over year in Q4 to more than 2 million, a growth rate that suggests that some people are leaving other insurance providers for Lemonade. Its product line isn't yet as fully fleshed out as those of its longer-established competitors, but customers can get renters, homeowners, car, pet, and life insurance policies from it.\n\nInsurance companies make their profits when they pay out less in total claims than customers pay in total premiums. Lemonade isn't profitable yet. However, its non-GAAP EBITDA losses in Q4 were $29 million, a 44% smaller loss than it had in the prior-year period. Importantly, Lemonade has $945 million in cash on the books, and it generated positive cash flow in the back half of last year. That's a good sign that it is financially stable.\n\nLemonade is a risky investment at this point -- for the company to prosper, it still must continue to pick up customers and find a way to turn profitable. However, more risk offers more opportunity for higher rewards, and Lemonade, with its $1.2 billion market cap,\u00a0 could be a portfolio-changer if it can evolve into a major player in insurance.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 unstoppable stocks that will make you richer. To skip the detailed analysis of the economy and market, go directly to the 5 Unstoppable Stocks That Will Make You Richer.\n\nOn April 12, the week closed out with stocks tumbling as the\u00a0 S&P 500 recorded its worst day since January 31, declining 1.46% on the day. On top of that, oil prices are rising significantly as tensions in the Middle East grow. The WTI Crude has risen around $10 since January and is at $85.5 per barrel. The stubbornness of inflation has kept investors and other experts wondering what would happen next.\n\nInterest Rates Amid Current Inflationary Environment\n\nThe latest inflation report showed a higher-than-expected increase of 3.5% which has shaken markets and raised concerns about the possibility of a recession. In an interview with Bloomberg, on April 11, BMO Capital\u2019s strategist, Ian Lyngen, suggests that if inflation continues at these levels, the Federal Reserve may feel compelled to induce a recession in order to meet its 2% inflation target. Manulife Investment Management\u2019s chief economist, Frances Donald also agrees with Ian Lyngen and thinks that inflation is going to \u201csurprise upside\u201d in the near term, causing the Fed to lose the data support to cut interest rates. She said:\n\n\u201cThat increases the probability of a recession and I remember members of my team, back in December said, the Fed is pivoted early, this is gonna provide indirect easing, we should lower our probability of recession calls for 2024. But now that we're back to an environment where we're losing those embedded rate cuts, we actually have to increase the chance of something bad happening here.\"\n\nBlackRock, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:BLK) CEO, Larry Fink told CNBC on April 12, that he still expects two rate cuts this year but the Fed isn\u2019t likely to meet the 2% inflation target. We previously mentioned the comments from BlackRock, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:BLK) Managing Director, Tony DeSpirito, that he keeps a bullish view of the current year and the years ahead.

The stock isn\u2019t on our current list as analyst price targets do not show enough upside for the stock. However, the company still has massive future growth potential despite new competitors rising to take away a bit of AI accelerator market share from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nNevertheless, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya still believes in the stock\u2019s upside potential and says that the company\u2019s commanding presence in business sales not only shields its market share but also positions it strategically to potentially increase its market share. On April 10, the analyst reiterated a Buy rating on NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock with a $1,100 price target, up from $925.\n\nDuring the tech industry surge of 2023, there were a few multi-baggers that remained in the dark with all the news surrounding the AI revolution. XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO) was one such company that returned massively when everyone was busy looking at the Magnificent 7. It is a Connecticut-based company that handles less-than-truckload (LTL) shipping across North America. While the broader industrial sector significantly underperformed the market in 2023, XPO, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:XPO) share price gained over 163%. Additionally, the company's stock is up 48.2% year-to-date on April 12 compared to the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLI) 23% gain over the same period. On top of that, the company isn\u2019t looking to slow down in the next few years. Its CEO, Mario Harik made the following comments at the company\u2019s latest earnings call:\n\n\u201cFor 2024, we expect our LTL capex level to be in the low-teens as a percent of revenue, and again, primarily allocated to our fleet. In terms of the 28 service centers, we acquired from Yellow, the largest impact on our capital strategy is timing. We've put forward dozens of real estate investments that we plan to make over the next several years. I'll add some strategic color to my earlier comments on the acquisition.\n\nThese service centers will deliver important benefits to the business for years to come. First, they'll get us closer to customers, and give us larger facilities in major metro areas. This should drive substantial cost efficiencies across our line haul, pickup-and-delivery and dock operations. Second, they'll enhance our yield growth by further improving, our service with fewer freight three handles, reduce damages, and better on-time performance.\n\nAnd third, that'll give us more capacity in key metros like Indianapolis, Columbus and Las Vegas. These are markets where we are currently turning away profitable customers, because we don't have enough door capacity. We plan to start bringing these locations online in April and have all of them operational within the next 12 months to 18 months. We expect the transaction to be accretive to EPS and our LTL operating ratio in 2025.\u201d\n\nNow let us move on to unstoppable stocks of the current year that can potentially make you richer. The list includes Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

We narrowed down our list to 10 stocks with the highest average analyst price target upsides and listed them in ascending order of upside potential, primarily, and year-to-date gains, secondarily. Analyst ratings and price targets were taken from TipRanks.\n\nWe also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 elite hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 Unstoppable Stocks That Will Make You Richer\n\n10. Broadcom Inc.

(NASDAQ:AVGO).\n\nClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWhile the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.\n\nSemiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.\u201d\n\n9. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)\n\nPrice Target Upside: 14.48%\n\nYear-to-date Gain as of April 11: 30.49%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 129\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) offers ride-hailing services and operates through three segments, Mobility, Delivery, and Freight. For the quarter ended on December 31, 2023, the company recorded 28 million trips per day and 150 million monthly active platform consumers.

(NYSE:UBER), with 34 analysts rating the stock a Buy. As of April 11, the stock\u2019s average price target of $87.19 represents an upside of 14.48% to its current price.\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) was part of 129 funds\u2019 portfolios and the total stake amounted to $8.74 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. D E Shaw has increased its stake in the company by 30% to 14.39 million shares worth $886.123 million and is the most significant shareholder, as of the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nRiverPark Advisors stated the following regarding Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was a top contributor in the quarter following better than expected 3Q23 earnings and 4Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $35.3 billion were up 21% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $17.9 billion grew 30% over last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings of $16 billion were up 16% from last year and continued to be strong throughout the quarter. 1Q Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion, up $576 million year over year, was better than management\u2019s guidance of $1 billion, and the company generated $900 million of free cash flow, up from $358 million last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 4Q Gross Bookings (23.5% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $1.2 billion).\n\nUBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates.1 Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than a ride sharing and food delivery service; we also see it as a global mobility platform with 142 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and the ability to penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and hourly worker staffing. Given its $5.2 billion of unrestricted cash and $5.1 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $128 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 21x our estimates of next year\u2019s free cash flow.\u201d\n\n8. Corebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE:CRBG)\n\nPrice Target Upside: 14.78%\n\nYear-to-date Gain as of April 11: 23.82%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 39\n\nCorebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE:CRBG), previously known as SAFG Retirement Services, Inc., offers retirement solutions, and insurance products in the U.S. The company operates through Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance, and Institutional Markets businesses.\n\nCorebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE:CRBG) has gained 23.82% year-to-date, as of April 11. Hedge fund sentiment was positive toward the stock in Q4 of 2023 as hedge funds with investments in the stock were 39, with positions worth $841.095 million.

The average price target of $31.22 implies an upside of 14.78% from the present levels, as of April 11.\n\nArtisan Partners made the following comment about Corebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE:CRBG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cCorebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE:CRBG), a provider of life insurance and retirement solutions, was a standout in the financials sector. Corebridge was previously a unit of AIG and a September 2022 IPO. Earnings and cash flow have been solid, aided by increased spread income in the general account due to higher reinvestment rates. We added Corebridge to the portfolio in Q1 2023. Our thesis is now that Corebridge is not a part of a large inefficient and capital-constrained parent, the company should have plenty of room to improve its competitive position. Establishing new processes that both improve capabilities and wring out efficiencies as a standalone entity should help improve ROE in coming years. It has a 4%+ dividend yield and a double-digit free cash flow yield, even in 2022 when negative fixed income and equity markets reduced fee revenue. In addition to the dividend, free cash flow will be used to ensure holding company liquidity, repurchase stock and support modest growth expectations.\u201d\n\n7. Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH)\n\nPrice Target Upside: 15.12%\n\nYear-to-date Gain as of April 11: 37%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\n\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.

With 2.6 million shares worth $142.671 million, Marshall Wace LLP is the most prominent shareholder in the company as of December 31, 2023.\n\nBased on 9 Wall Street analysts\u2019 ratings over the past three months, Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) has a consensus rating of Strong Buy. The average price target of $93.10 implies an upside of 15.123% from the last price of $80.87, as of April 11.\n\nArtisan Partners stated the following regarding Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe initiated new GardenSM positions in Equifax, Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) and Xylem during the quarter. Celsius is an energy drink company viewed as providing a healthier option than its large competitors. We believe Celsius\u2019 product portfolio appeals to a broad demographic, attracting new consumers and more frequent usage occasions in the energy drink category, enabling Celsius to grow sales through market share gains and market expansion. Furthermore, the company signed a US distribution partnership with PepsiCo in October 2022, which is bringing the product into new points of distribution while also improving its penetration across existing points of presence. The end result should be better product availability, increasing brand awareness, higher sales volumes and scale-driven margin improvements.\u201d\n\n6. Sea Limited (NYSE:SE)\n\nPrice Target Upside: 15.34%\n\nYear-to-date Gain as of April 11: 44.84%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 51\n\nSea Limited (NYSE:SE) is involved in digital entertainment, e-commerce, and digital financial service businesses, through Garena, Shopee, and SeaMoney, respectively.

The average price target of $64.38 represents an upside of 15.34% from the last price of $55.82, as of April 11.\n\nSea Limited (NYSE:SE) was part of 51 funds\u2019 portfolios and the total stake value was $2.173 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. As of Q4 of 2023, Tiger Global Management LLC is the top shareholder in the company and has a position worth $579.966 million.\n\nSea Limited (NYSE:SE) is one of the unstoppable stocks that will make you richer, in addition to Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), and CRH plc (NYSE:CRH).\n\nLakehouse Capital stated the following regarding Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the largest detractor was Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) (-17.1%), which sold off following the release of its quarterly results where earnings came in below expectations. For our part, while a headline drop in profitability can appear worrying, we aren\u2019t overly concerned as it was merely a function of management\u2019s intentional decision to increase investment towards e-commerce to drive growth. As the broader Southeast Asian e-commerce market recovers from some post pandemic headwinds and their primary competitor TikTok is entangled in a regulatory setback in Indonesia, we agree with management that now is the time to be aggressive and pivot back to growth mode and consolidate market share.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Unstoppable Stocks That Will Make You Richer.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy Now 11 Best Nanotechnology Stocks To Invest In 20 Biggest Iron Ore Mining Companies in Australia, 2024\n\nDisclosure.

While many investors seek to find a winning stock, it\u2019s best to diversify your holdings across numerous assets. This has led to this list of top stocks to buy.\n\nSpreading your money across multiple stocks minimizes your risk. You also have the opportunity to generate higher long-term returns. It\u2019s good to shop around for stocks even when you feel content with your portfolio.

The recent pullback has resulted in a 46-forward P/E ratio for the cosmetics company.\n\nWhile some investors may feel nervous about the valuation, the reaction to Ulta news is overdone. The two beauty companies are in different leagues when it comes to growth rates. Ulta\u2019s revenue growth hovers at around 10% year-over-year. Meanwhile, Elf Beauty reported an 85% year-over-year increase in net sales and gained 305 basis points of market share in\u00a0Q3 FY24.\n\nElf Beauty has been maintaining 80% year-over-year revenue growth for several quarters while delivering impressive net income growth as well. The company also raised its fiscal 2024 outlook and achieved its 20th consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nAnalysts have rated the stock as a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d with a projected 30% upside. The stock has already been up by 92% over the past year. The correction presents a long-term buying opportunity, and it\u2019s possible for Elf Beauty to gain market share while others in the industry report slower sales. The second stock on this list follows that trend.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) An image of a hacker on a laptop with icons of messages and data behind him\n\nSource: jossnat / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity firm that continues to grow at a solid rate while competitors are slamming the brakes and announcing lukewarm guidance. Crowdstrike previously declined in solidarity with other cybersecurity stocks as they reported unfavorable guidance. Investors had a change of heart after Crowdstrike reported a strong earnings report for Q4 FY24.\n\nRevenue grew by 33% year-over-year to reach $845.3 million. The company also has $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue which serves as a good baseline. It\u2019s getting easier for hackers to threaten companies. They can use artificial intelligence to brute force their way into unprotected databases. These tools are getting more advanced, and the Crowdstrike Falcon Platform offers good protection from cyberattacks. This makes it one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdstrike has always delivered impressive revenue growth, but the company\u2019s rising profit margins are also stirring up excitement. The company reported $53.7 million in GAAP net income compared to a $47.5 million GAAP net loss in the same period last year. The stock has gained 392% over the past five years.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Writing note showing Content Marketing.

Cloud computing, online marketplace sales, advertising, and video streaming are some of the catalysts that are prompting higher price targets.\n\nThe stock currently has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating and an average price target that suggests a 13% upside. Amazon only has Buy ratings from its 41 analysts. The highest price target of $230 per share suggests that the stock can rally by an additional 24%.\n\nAmazon is growing in multiple industries and recently reported its highest-ever revenue.

The social media firm has $65.40 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. On the other hand, it only has $18.39 billion in long-term debt. Meta Platforms reduced its headcount by 22% year-over-year to facilitate its profit margin expansion.\n\nMETA stock has now become a dividend growth play as the company recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. The company will probably maintain an annualized growth rate above 10% for many years.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers healthy sports beverages that does not have ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, sugar, or gluten.

Stock analysts dig deep into investment theses for a living and present their research to consumers and clients.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) industry has captivated investors. Corporations have been rushing to incorporate the technology into their operations to increase efficiency and revenue. AI was the big buzzword of 2023, and that momentum has carried over into 2024.\n\nMany of the top AI stocks have continued to rack up gains. The sector is attracting a lot of speculation, which can risk the loss of capital. However, some AI stocks are the real deal and look ready to deliver long-term returns for their shareholders.\n\nIt\u2019s not too late to invest in the best AI stocks to buy. These are some of the stocks that you may want to monitor.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity firm that continues to grow while most competitors are losing ground. The company has an excellent recurring revenue model that grew by 34% year-over-year (YoY) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Annual recurring revenue currently stands at $3.44 billion.\n\nCybersecurity is a lucrative industry since businesses need safeguards to protect their data and sensitive documents from hackers. Cybercriminals are getting smarter and\u00a0some are turning to AI to initiate more cyber attacks. Cybersecurity firms are fortifying their defenses with AI tool offerings.\n\nCrowdStrike recently launched\u00a0Charlotte AI, which allows cybersecurity teams to streamline their work and detect threats more quickly. A customer survey revealed the average person saves two hours per day with the company\u2019s generative AI solution. Charlotte AI was built by defenders for defenders, and it\u2019s one of the driving forces for CrowdStrike\u2019s gains. The stock is up by 397% over the past 5 years.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been incorporating AI into many of its products and services. The company uses AI to offer relevant product recommendations for people who browse its online marketplace. Amazon Web Services also utilizes AI to offer customers more choices. AWS allows customers to build better AI applications that can generate more leads and save time.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI requires more computing power. While advanced chips power the hardware, cloud computing is the software component. The\u00a0cloud computing industry has been growing as more companies adopt AI. Cloud platforms have the flexibility to handle and store additional data.\n\nAmazon is still a juggernaut that reports strong financials. Profit margins recently expanded as the company reached a record $170.0 billion in sales in\u00a0Q4 2023. Revenue increased by 14%, and most of Amazon\u2019s important segments exhibited double-digit revenue growth rates. North American sales increased 13% YoY, while international sales jumped by 17% YoY. Amazon Web Services revenue was 13% higher than the same period last year.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSynopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a chipmaker riding the AI tailwinds. The stock isn\u2019t reliant on AI and reported solid financials long before the technology became mainstream. Synopsys stock is up by 395% over the past 5 years and has posted a 13% year-to-date gain.\n\nThe stock has a 63 P/E ratio and impressive profit margin expansion that suggests more upside. The company achieved a 27% net profit margin as revenue and earnings both soared in the\u00a0first quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue increased by 21% YoY while net income jumped by 65% YoY. Synopsys also exceeded the high end of guidance for its quarterly GAAP EPS.\n\nSynopsys is in the process of acquiring\u00a0Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS), which would lead to additional market share. The semiconductor firm is delivering healthy financial growth while having a meaningful runway. AI tailwinds can elevate the stock price and reward long-term investors.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AMZN and SNPS.

        "title": "Investing in Digital Defense: 3 Cybersecurity Stocks Leading the Charge",
        "content": "Cybersecurity stocks are in the spotlight as the sector booms, driven by increased digital reliance and heightened cyber threats. This growth is amplified as companies integrate technologies like cloud computing, AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), and big data analytics into their operations, leading to new cybersecurity challenges.\n\nCybercrime has been identified as a leading threat to the global economy over the next decade. With potential cybercrime costs surpassing $8 trillion in 2023, the need for effective cybersecurity strategies is more pressing than ever. Research suggests the cybersecurity market is likely to grow from $182.8 billion in 2024 to $314.3 billion by 2029, with an 11.4% \u00a0compound annual growth rate (CAGR). As a result, Wall Street offers significant investment opportunities in cybersecurity companies leading the development of crucial security measures.\u00a0With that information, let\u2019s explore three cybersecurity stocks for your watchlist.\n\nAkamai Technologies (AKAM) building facade with akamai (AKAM) logo on it. representing tech stocks\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first name among our cybersecurity stocks is Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM), an established player in cloud-based security solutions. The company\u2019s Intelligent Edge Platform sits between businesses and the internet, acting as a powerful shield against cyber threats. As internet usage, data consumption, and reliance on cloud services soar, AKAM stock is poised to benefit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAkamai\u2019s management announced solid fourth quarter and full year results for 2023 in mid-February, delivering revenues of $995 million, up 7% year over year (YOY). Also, net income per diluted share saw significant growth, coming in at $1.69, up 23% YOY.\n\nRecently, Akamai teamed up with Neural Magic, a developer of software that accelerates AI workloads. The partnership will boost its AI security, enhancing deep learning on its network. This highlights Akamai\u2019s commitment to cybersecurity innovation, offering an efficient platform for deep learning on CPU servers.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, Akamai stock has lost over 10% year to date (YTD). Meanwhile, the shares are changing hands at about 15 times forward earnings and 4.5 times sales. Wall Street\u2019s 12-month price forecast stands at $127.18, suggesting an upside potential of 19% from the current price levels. True, AKAM stock may remain volatile in the short run. But long-term potential for growth and value creation makes it Akamai an attractive cybersecurity stock.\n\niShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (IHAK) the word \"etf\" spelled out in many yellow cubes against a background of many black cubes\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Imagentle\n\nNext on our list of cybersecurity stocks is the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:IHAK). Targeting long-term growth, this ETF invests in global companies at the forefront of cybersecurity innovation.\n\nCurrently, IHAK has 35 holdings, where the top ten constitute about 45% of its portfolio. With net assets around $841 million, its investments are mainly allocated to the information technology (86.2%) and industrials (13.3%) sectors. Geographically, 72.6% of its investments are in U.S. companies, followed by Israel (9.63%), Japan (4.18%), and Taiwan (3.1%).\n\nLeading holdings include Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), Cyberark Software (NASDAQ:CYBR), Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) and Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT).\n\nSo far this year, IHAK is up around 1.5%. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios are 37.10x and 5.52x, respectively. Finally, investors should note that the ETF has an expense ratio of 0.47%.\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nToday\u2019s last pick, Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS), is another prominent cloud security company. The company primarily sells subscriptions to its Falcon platform and cloud modules. It offers cloud-delivered protection of endpoints, cloud workloads, identity and data.\n\nRecent earnings indicate revenues grew 35% YOY to $525 million. Additionally, free cash flow was $100.8 million, indicating financial stability and the potential for future investments in R&D and acquisitions.\n\nIn March, Zscaler acquired Avalor, a security startup focused on protecting against attacks that target data. The acquisition extends the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange data with Avalor\u2019s Data Fabric for Security, which uses AI to identify and protect sensitive data. This strategic move by Zscaler underscores management\u2019s commitment to innovation.\n\nHowever, ZS has lost over 17% YTD. Shares are trading at 63 times forward earnings and 14 times sales. Despite the relatively rich valuation, the 12-month median price forecast for Zscaler stock stands at $263.72 with an potential of over 40%.\u00a0In other words, analysts remain optimistic about Zscaler\u2019s potential for growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "Spotting Winners: Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) And Cybersecurity Stocks In Q4\n\nAs the Q4 earnings season comes to a close, it\u2019s time to take stock of this quarter's best and worst performers in the cybersecurity industry, including Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) and its peers.\n\nCybersecurity continues to be one of the fastest-growing segments within software for good reason. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing rising cybersecurity risks. Businesses are accelerating adoption of cloud-based software, moving data and applications into the cloud to save costs while improving performance. This migration has opened them to a multitude of new threats, like employees accessing data via their smartphone while on an open network, or logging into a web-based interface from a laptop in a new location.\n\nThe 9 cybersecurity stocks we track reported a mixed Q4; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.9%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was in line with consensus. Stocks have faced challenges as investors prioritize near-term cash flows, and while some of the cybersecurity stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have not been spared, with share prices declining 7.2% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nRapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD)\n\nFounded in 2000 with the idea that network security comes before endpoint security, Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) provides software as a service that helps companies understand where they are exposed to cyber security risks, quickly detect breaches and respond to them.\n\nRapid7 reported revenues of $205.3 million, up 11.3% year on year, topping analyst expectations by 1.9%.

        "title": "3 Hypergrowth Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "Many hypergrowth stocks were crushed in 2022 as rising rates compressed their valuations and drove investors toward more conservative investments. But over the past year, many of those stocks bounced back as interest rates stabilized.\n\nInvestors might be wary of chasing that rally as the major indexes hover near their all-time highs. However, I think it's still a good idea to pick up some shares of high-growth companies that lead their respective markets. I believe these three popular stocks fit the bill: Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU), Duolingo(NASDAQ: DUOL), and CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD). Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nu Holdings\n\nNu Holdings is a digital bank that serves customers in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. It served 93.9 million customers at the end of 2023, compared to 54 million customers just two years ago. It's an online-only bank that doesn't operate any physical branches -- which makes it a great play on Latin America's rising income levels and internet penetration rates.\n\nIn addition to digital checking and savings accounts, Nu provides credit cards, payment services, business loans, investment tools, and insurance services. That ecosystem is sticky: Its average customer uses four of those products.\n\nIn 2023, Nu's adjusted net income surged 488% to $1.2 billion. Analysts expect its adjusted earnings to grow another 64% in 2024 and 61% in 2025 as it cross-sells more services, expands its user base, enters more Latin American markets, and profits from historically high interest rates across the region.\n\nThose are high growth rates for a stock that trades at just 27 times forward earnings -- and Nu could still have plenty of room to run as more unbanked individuals across Latin America sign up for its services.\n\n2. Duolingo\n\nDuolingo owns the world's most downloaded online learning app. It's best known for its online courses for more than 40 languages, but it also provides a stand-alone English proficiency test and other apps for phonics, math, and music lessons.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt disrupted traditional education software applications over the past few years by gamifying the experience with gems and rewards. For its paid users, It eliminated ads and rolled out more perks. It also expects to profit from the expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market as it uses generative AI tools to accelerate its development of new courses.\n\nDuolingo served 88.4 million monthly active users (MAUs) at the end of 2023, representing a 46% increase from a year earlier. Its revenue rose 44% to $531 million for the full year, and its net profit of $16 million marked a significant improvement from its net loss of $60 million in 2022.\n\nFor 2024, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to rise 37% and 257%, respectively, as it continues to gain new users. For 2025, they expect its revenue and earnings to grow 27% and 86%, respectively.\n\nDuolingo's stock isn't cheap at 132 times forward earnings, but its rapid growth, rising profits, and dominance of the online education market could all justify that higher valuation.\n\n3. CrowdStrike\n\nMany cybersecurity companies install on-site appliances to run their services, but that approach is expensive, takes up a lot of space, requires constant on-site maintenance, and can be difficult to scale as an organization expands. CrowdStrike addresses those issues with Falcon, its cloud-native platform that doesn't require any on-site appliances.\n\nThat disruptive approach has enabled it to grow like a weed. Its revenue rose 36% to $3.06 billion in fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), and it expects 28% to 31% growth in fiscal 2025. Analysts expect 27% revenue growth in fiscal 2026.\n\nIt attributes its healthy growth in a tough macro environment to its market share gains, its expansion in the government sector, and generative AI upgrades for its extended detection and response (XDR) platform. It's also been cross-selling more services: 43% of its customers had adopted at least six of its cloud-based modules (up from its starting set of four modules) -- compared to 39% of its customers at the end of fiscal 2023.\n\nCrowdStrike has also stayed profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in each quarter of fiscal 2024. Analysts expect its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to rise 27% in fiscal 2025 and 25% in fiscal 2026. Its stock might look a bit pricey at 81 times forward earnings, but it's still a best-in-breed play on the booming cybersecurity market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nu Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nu Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nu Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The one great thing about stock investing is that different types of stocks suit different types of investors. One type is particularly popular nowadays: growth stocks. These are companies that are expected to grow earnings faster than the market average. It's easy to see why growth stocks are popular, too. They give investors the chance to produce market-beating returns and capitalize on a company's future success.\n\nIf you have $1,000 available to invest (meaning you have an emergency fund saved and high-interest debt paid down), the following two companies are good investment options to consider. Investing $500 into each can expose investors to top players in fast-growing industries.\n\n1. CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) is one of the premier cybersecurity companies in the world and is working hard to strengthen its competitive advantage.\n\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) has recently become mainstream, it's far from a new technology. CrowdStrike can attest to this, as the company has been using AI to automate the cybersecurity process since it released its first platform in 2011. It essentially pioneered the pure AI-based solutions model.\n\nCrowdStrike's jump on pure AI-based cybersecurity solutions has worked quite well for the company. In the fourth quarter, the company generated $283 million in free cash flow, up 35% year over year and well above what it was just a few years ago. CRWD Free Cash Flow (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe impressive growth of CrowdStrike's free cash flow is aided by its growing annual recurring revenue (ARR), a key financial metric for companies whose business models are subscription-based, like CrowdStrike. In its fiscal year 2024, CrowdStrike brought in $875 million in new ARR, bringing its total to $3.44 billion.\n\nFree cash flow and ARR are good indicators of the company's financial health because they show its ability to generate profits from a stable revenue base. And looking at its market opportunity, there seems to be much more room for this to continue.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike and market intelligence firm IDC estimate the total addressable market (TAM) for the AI-native security platform to be around $100 billion in 2024. In 2028, they expect the TAM to hit $225 billion, leaving plenty of growth opportunities for CrowdStrike in that specific cybersecurity lane.\n\nCrowdStrike is well positioned to be around for the long haul.\n\n2. DraftKings\n\nDraftKings(NASDAQ: DKNG) has become the leader in online U.S. sports betting and iGaming and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.\n\nAlthough DraftKings has been around for over a decade, the recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to allow states to legalize and regulate sports betting individually has opened a new world of opportunities for the company. So far, it's done a great job of taking advantage of the fast-growing market.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, DraftKings generated $1.23 billion in revenue, up 44% year over year. Perhaps more importantly, the company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) finally turned positive, reaching $151 million (a $201 million increase year over year).\n\nDraftKings has noted that its current priority is capturing as much market share as possible, so profitability hasn't been the top priority, but its recent impressive financial performance hints that profitability could be around the corner. This is especially true if DraftKings' free cash flow continues on its current trend. DKNG Free Cash Flow (Quarterly) Chart\n\nIn its fiscal year 2024, DraftKings expects its free cash flow to come in between $310 million and $410 million, giving it a good amount of financial leeway to supplement its organic growth with other means of growth, like acquisitions. It has shown it doesn't mind doing the latter, with a recent $750 million acquisition of Jackpocket, the No. 1 lottery app in the U.S.\n\nDraftKings' Jackpocket acquisition will give it a stronghold in the $100 billion-plus lottery industry. It will also allow it to cross-sell its products, increase customer acquisition, and strengthen its overall business by opening new revenue streams and reducing the risks of concentrated business models.\n\nThere's no denying that the U.S. sports betting market is growing rapidly (for better or worse, but that's a different story), and DraftKings is one of the top players in the industry. That's a recipe for good value to be returned to shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at\u00a0the 11 Overvalued Stocks Insiders are Dumping Now. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Overvalued Stocks Insiders are Dumping Now.\n\nWise investors almost always keep track of corporate insider activity because paying attention to insider sentiment has proven to be a successful strategy several times in the past. For example, when markets were wavering amid the coronavirus crisis, insiders started piling into stocks like crazy in March 2020. In just about 20 days insiders bought $1.19 billion in company shares. Later events proved that they were right. Markets were quick to roar back to new highs driven by stimulus packages and rising consumer spending. Insiders were also selling in November 2021, when the Federal Reserve was getting ready to start cutting interest rates.\n\nTracking Insider Buying and Selling: Performance Through the Years\n\nBut should you always look towards insider sentiment to guess what\u2019s coming next. Are insider bets always right?\u00a0 Some data points show that if you keep paying attention to insider sentiment without incorporating outlier or black swan events, you\u2019d face surprising results. In January 2023, for example, the Wall Street Journal said in a report that insiders were not expecting a rebound because they weren\u2019t buying shares of their own companies. The Journal\u2019s analysis at that time was based on insider buying to selling ratio which ticked up in June 2022 but then started to decline without any major increases. The report at the time also cited Nejat Seyhun, a finance professor at the University of Michigan, who was worried that insiders were not buying despite prices coming down to very low levels. Seyhun said that this indicator was a \u201cwarning\u201d about things to come. The WSJ report also said that insider sentiment started to decline in November and December 2021 since in these two months shares of \u201calmost twice as many companies were sold by insiders as were bought.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nBut were insiders right? The S&P 500 at the end of January 2023, when insider sentiment was down, was at 3,824.14, while it ended the year at 4,769.83. The AI-led rally that surprised the financial markets was really an outlier event and we are still seeing its effects without any end in sight.\n\nSimilarly, in May 2022, insiders were brushing aside recession warnings and piling into stocks. Bloomberg, citing The\u00a0Washington Service, at the time reported that 1,100 corporate executives and officers had bought their company shares in May through May 23. The S&P 500 closed the month of May at 4,132, while at the end of the year it was at 3,893.\n\nWhat's the Insider Sentiment in April 2024?\n\nCurrently, the overall Insider Buy/Sell ratio is 0.23, which is quite low and shows that insiders are not bullish on the short-term future. And this isn\u2019t unexpected. Many analysts are expecting a wider market pullback in the short term since they believe the AI-led rally has gone too far and stocks need a breather. They have been questioning the valuations of large-cap tech stocks. Some analysts however believe the AI rally would now broaden to smaller companies.\n\nIs Following Insider Buying and Selling Profitable in 2024?\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at how insider sentiment-focused investing strategies have been performing in the recent past. AdvisorShares Insider Advantage ETF (SURE), which invests in companies \u201creducing their equity float through buyback programs and insider buying,\u201d is up 10.6% year to date, compared to the 8.5% gain posted by the S&P 500 in the same period. Over the past one year the ETF is up 30%.\n\nAnother testament to the effectiveness of keeping an eye on insider trading is the returns posted by Insider Monkey\u2019s monthly newsletter and portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences. The portfolio returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs\u2019 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.\n\nWhich Sectors are Seeing Insider Buying and Selling These Days?\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s analysis of insider buying and selling activity over the past few days shows that insiders are dumping technology stocks in droves. Out of the 83 important insider selling transactions since the start of this month, 26 were related to technology companies. When it comes to insider buying, financials stocks took the lead with 29 insider buys over the past week, followed by healthcare. This was also expected since analysts have been recommending investors to look beyond technology stocks and pile into healthcare, financials and utilities amid low valuations and rate cut expectations. Overvalued Stocks Insiders are Dumping Now\n\nLuis Louro / shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify stocks with PE ratios over 50.

We believe Boston Scientific can grow revenue in the high single digits, driven by differentiated products used to treat atrial fibrillation, such as pulsed field ablation, among others. The company held an Investor Day in September at which management established financial targets for the 2024 to 2026 period calling for an organic sales CAGR of 8% to 10%, 150 basis points of margin expansion, and strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth and improved free-cash-flow conversion. We think this growth profile makes Boston Scientific a compelling name within the large medical device universe.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the5 Overvalued Stocks Insiders are Dumping Now.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nForget Magnificent Seven: Jim Cramer Likes These \u2018Super 7\u2019 European Stocks Insiders Are Buying These 11 Penny Stocks Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Generally, when new technology is introduced, investment opportunities are speculative and risky. This happened first with personal computers, and now, with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. By now, nearly every big tech company has its hands firmly inside the AI cookie jar, with most small and mid-cap companies also following suit. It\u2019s not an overstatement to say that AI has the potential to be the biggest game-changer in technology since the internet itself.\n\nThe best AI investments will provide a platform for other tangential businesses. Not only will they be utilizing AI to better serve their customers, but they will be also building new AI-driven products and services to forever change industry dynamics. Here are our three picks for the best AI stocks to consider for your portfolio.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL) Google headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nSource: achinthamb / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the world\u2019s largest companies and owns several dominant brands in the tech industry. These include Google Search, YouTube, and the Android operating system. Currently, the stock\u2019s median price target of $163.12 represents a potential 10% upside from its current price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite facing a couple of missteps at the start, this big tech company has been one of the first to jump right into the AI waters. Google Bard, for instance, made headlines for producing inaccurate responses that put it a level below ChatGPT. Now though, beyond simply Google Bard, Google has launched AI appliances such as Vertex AI and Project IDX to help websites, workspaces and workflow. As Gemini (a rebranded Bard) slowly becomes the leading generative AI platform integrated into Google\u2019s suite of applications, investors can be optimistic about this company\u2019s strength as one of the AI industry\u2019s leaders.\n\nAlphabet also remains one of the cheapest mega-cap stocks relative to its competitors, trading at just 22.27x forward earnings and 6.25x sales. In terms of earnings, this makes GOOGL cheaper than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Alphabet\u2019s strength is also demonstrated by its 14 consecutive quarters of increased revenue and five-year revenue CAGR of 18%. As far as AI and blue-chip tech stocks go for us, GOOGL is a no-brainer.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is an American software company most recognized for its flagship products including Adobe Acrobat, Illustrator, and Premiere. Yahoo Finance analysts currently give a consensus average price target of about $574.00, 15% higher than today\u2019s closing price.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, you might not immediately think of Adobe. Nonetheless, the company has been leveraging generative AI to give its creative customers some of the most comprehensive artistic tools. These include the Adobe Firefly platform which will drastically grow the scale of deliverable AI-generated branded content for enterprise users and content creators. In fact, one of the early adopters of Adobe Firefly was Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which used the platform to create its Dreamworld campaign.\n\nLooking at its financials, we see a stock that trades at roughly a fair value compared to its tech industry peers. However, where Adobe truly stands out is its profitability. Adobe currently has an 88.08% gross margin, over 80% higher than its sector median of 48.62%! With a 10-year net income compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34% as well, we see Adobe as a profitability cash cow in the AI space.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an American multinational cybersecurity company that was founded in 2011. Yahoo Finance analysts almost all rate it a Buy or Strong Buy, with a median one-year price target nearly 20% higher than its current price.\n\nThe bull case for Crowdstrike and AI is twofold. The first case is based on its Falcon platform. This platform is trained on trillions of historical security events and utilizes AI and machine learning to identify, detect, and neutralize potential threats. Additionally, Crowdstrike also has a generative AI security analyst named Charlotte that can help users with its diverse range of products. As elevated cybersecurity concerns arise due to the increase in AI used for malicious reasons, we see Crowdstrike as an investment at the forefront of solving these issues.\n\nCRWD has already gained nearly 150% over the past 52 weeks. While its valuation is slightly elevated over its sector mean, we find confidence in its outstanding balance between growth and profitability. For instance, despite growing at a five-year revenue CAGR Of 65%, CRWD has still managed to maintain incredibly strong gross margins of over 75%!\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying These 2 Hypergrowth Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "For the better part of three decades, there has been no shortage of next-big-thing investments that have captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors. Since the advent of the internet completely changed the course of business in the mid-1990s, there's nothing that's garnered as much buzz on Wall Street as the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nWith AI and the incorporation of machine learning (ML), software and systems have the ability to learn over time and become more proficient at their tasks. The broad-reaching scope of AI in virtually every sector and industry is why the analysts at PwC believe it could add more than $15 trillion to global gross domestic product by the turn of the decade. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlthough dozens of stocks have benefited from the AI revolution, none have enjoyed a more direct boost to their sales and bottom line than semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nThis \"infrastructure backbone\" of the AI revolution is on the chopping block by billionaires\n\nIn a little more than a year, Nvidia has become what I like to call the \"infrastructure backbone\" of the AI movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have come to dominate high-compute data centers. Though estimates vary, Nvidia's ultra-fast GPUs might account for 90% (or more) of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year.\n\nThis is a company that's also enjoying otherworldly pricing power on its GPUs. With demand overwhelming supply throughout 2023, cost of revenue moved only modestly higher while data center sales more than tripled. This is a pretty clear indication that pricing power is behind much of Nvidia's sales and profit spike.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced that Nvidia is headed higher. During the December-ended quarter, eight prominent billionaire investors pared down their stakes in this top-performing megacap, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nStory continues\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nOne of the primary reasons to be skeptical of Nvidia's phenomenal run-up is that it's been driven by GPU scarcity. With Nvidia set to meaningfully increase its output in the current calendar year, and competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel rolling out advanced AI-GPUs of their own, it's only logical to expect its pricing power to decline.\n\nWhat's arguably even more concerning is that Nvidia's top four customers by revenue (40% of total sales) are all developing AI-GPUs of their own. This is either going to lessen their future reliance on Nvidia as their in-house data center chips complement what Nvidia produces, or they could phase Nvidia's infrastructure out altogether. Either way, it's a worrisome development for a richly valued stock.\n\nBut while billionaires were busy running for the exit from Nvidia, they weren't shy about pressing the buy button on two other hypergrowth AI stocks during the fourth quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings\n\nThe first high-octane AI growth stock that appeared to whet the whistles of billionaire money managers during the December-ended quarter is cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD). Four highly successful billionaires added to their funds' respective stakes in CrowdStrike, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International (400,988 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (97,900 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (91,091 shares)\n\nOn a macro basis, the cybersecurity industry has the look of a surefire growth story through at least the remainder of the decade. As businesses continue shifting their data online and into the cloud, third-party providers are being relied on with frequency to protect this information from hackers.\n\nFurthermore, cybersecurity solutions can thrive in any economic climate. A bad day for Wall Street or a rough patch for the U.S. economy doesn't mean a thing to hackers and robots looking to steal sensitive information. Since CrowdStrike is a subscription-driven company that protects end users, it's well-positioned to generate predictable cash flow no matter what's happening with the economy or stock market.\n\nOn a more company-specific basis, CrowdStrike brings clearly identifiable competitive advantages to the table for its customers and investors. The company's Falcon security platform is driven by AI and ML. Falcon is overseeing trillions of events each week, which are making it smarter and more effective at recognizing and responding to potential threats.\n\nThere are a couple of key performance indicators that demonstrate just how much pull CrowdStrike has with businesses. Even though its platform isn't the cheapest, gross retention rate has been pegged right around 98% for multiple years. Additionally, the company's net retention rate hasn't fallen below 119% in more than five years. This means the company's existing clients are spending at least 19% more on a year-over-year basis.\n\nBut the key to CrowdStrike's success has been its ability to upsell existing customers. Whereas a single-digit percentage of its clients seven years ago had purchased four or more cloud module subscriptions, 64% of its customers now have five or more cloud module subscriptions. These add-on sales have lifted its adjusted subscription gross margin to an impressive 80%!\n\nSnowflake\n\nThe second hypergrowth artificial intelligence stock that billionaires were buying as they were sending Nvidia to the chopping block during the December-ended quarter is cloud data-warehousing company Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW). Similar to CrowdStrike, four billionaire investors stepped up and added to their funds' stakes, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,985,426 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (1,204,387 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (888,047 shares)\n\nThere look to be two reasons why billionaire asset managers are choosing to load up on shares of Snowflake: opportunity and competitive edge.\n\nWith regard to the former, enterprise cloud spending, and AI solutions/applications within the cloud, are still in their early innings of expansion. Buying shares of Snowflake offers a way for investors to have exposure to the rapid growth in enterprise cloud and AI.\n\nThe other reason billionaires likely piled into Snowflake is because of its well-defined competitive advantages. For example, Snowflake's infrastructure is layered atop the leading cloud infrastructure service platforms. While sharing data can be challenging across competing cloud platforms, it's seamless for Snowflake's customers.\n\nLikewise, Snowflake doesn't rely on subscriptions. Rather, it charges customers based on the data they store and the Snowflake Compute Credits they use. This transparent pricing policy really seems to resonate with its users.\n\nThe one issue with Snowflake is the company's valuation. Don't get me wrong, CrowdStrike trades at an immense premium, but has seen its sales remain robust. Snowflake's revenue growth has slowed from the triple-digits three years ago to an estimated 22% in the current fiscal year. Snowflake is also valued at 115 times forward-year adjusted earnings, which is an even tougher pill to swallow for a company that's seen its sales growth slow from the triple digits.\n\nThough Snowflake looks to have a bright future, it could take some time before its operating performance grows into its current valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Could Soar: 2 Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Bull Market",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite recently set a new record high for the first time in more than two years. As a result, the growth-focused index is officially back in bull market territory, and that has historically boded well for stocks. Indeed, the Nasdaq returned an average of 215% during the eight bull markets that have taken place since 1990.\n\nInvestors hoping to capitalize on that upward momentum should be putting money into the stock market today. Here's why two Nasdaq stocks, Datadog(NASDAQ: DDOG) and CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), are worthwhile long-term investments.\n\n1. Datadog\n\nDatadog sells observability and security software. Its platform integrates 19 products, including infrastructure and application monitoring, user and developer experience monitoring, and log management solutions. Those tools help businesses prevent performance problems and protect their IT environments. The Datadog platform also features artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities that accelerate incident remediation.\n\nDatadog has an advantage in its ability to consolidate a broad range of observability workloads. Businesses can replace disparate products from different vendors with an integrated platform from Datadog. Consolidating workloads on a single platform tends to be more cost-efficient simply because there are fewer systems to maintain.\n\nThat platform strategy also means Datadog has a plethora of products with which it can land new customers and expand those relationships over time. The company has been successful in that respect, as evidenced by its strong presence in several observability markets. For instance, analysts have recognized the company as a top contender in application performance monitoring, cloud infrastructure monitoring, database monitoring, and AI for IT operations.\n\nDatadog delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, beating top-line guidance. The company increased its customer base by 18% year over year and reported a net revenue retention rate above 110%, meaning the average spend per existing customer rose more than 10% over the past year. In turn, sales climbed 26% year over year to $590 million and non-GAAP net income more than doubled to reach $0.44 per diluted share.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmong the more impressive figures was the 74% increase in remaining performance obligation (RPO), a leading indicator of future revenue. Specifically, RPO includes contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. The rapid expansion in RPO during the fourth quarter could lead to accelerating revenue growth in future quarters.\n\nGoing forward, Datadog should benefit from trends like cloud migration, AI, and the proliferation of software systems and connected devices. In short, anything that makes IT environments more complicated should drive demand for observability software. Datadog is well-positioned to capitalize on that demand. To quote Alex Zukin at Wolfe Research, \"Even in a cost-cutting obsessed macro environment, engineers simply cannot live without their Datadog.\"\n\nWall Street expects the company to grow sales at 25% annually over the next five years. In that context, the current valuation of 20.6 times sales is tolerable. To be clear, Datadog shares are not cheap and investors should expect volatility, but the company could also deliver above-average shareholder returns in the coming years. Now is a good time for patient, risk-tolerant investors to buy small positions in this technology stock.\n\n1. CrowdStrike Holdings\n\nCrowdStrike provides cybersecurity software and services. Its platform includes over two dozen applications that cover several large markets, and the company is a major player in many of them. Most notably, CrowdStrike is the leader in modern endpoint security, which Morgan Stanley sees as the largest and fastest-growing cybersecurity market. But analysts have also recognized CrowdStrike as a leader in cloud security, threat intelligence, and managed detection and response, among other markets.\n\nOne reason for that success is the breadth and simplicity of its Falcon platform. To quote CEO George Kurtz, \"CrowdStrike is the only single-platform, single-agent technology in cybersecurity that solves use cases well beyond endpoint protection.\" When Kurtz talks about \"single-agent technology,\" he is referring to the single, lightweight sensor through which every application is delivered. Unlike products from other vendors, that sensor can be installed without a reboot and it places very little burden on the device (it consumes less than 1% of compute resources).\n\nBeyond that, CrowdStrike has earned a reputation for best-in-class threat protection due to what some analysts see as superior artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. The rationale is that, as a leader in endpoint security and threat intelligence, CrowdStrike has a tremendous amount of security data on which to train its machine learning models.\n\nCrowdStrike continued to benefit from growing demand for cybersecurity in the fourth quarter. The company reported a net revenue retention rate of 119%, meaning existing customers spent 19% more over the past year. It also reported a gross retention rate of 98%, meaning it kept the vast majority of its customers. In turn, sales increased 33% to $845 million and non-GAAP net income increased 102% to $0.95 per diluted share.\n\nInnovation has kept CrowdStrike on the leading edge of cybersecurity. It was among the first vendors to deliver AI-powered protection from the cloud, and it's still bringing new products to market today. CrowdStrike recently launched Falcon for IT, software that unifies and automates IT and security workflows, and Kurtz says customer excitement is \"off the charts.\"\n\nAdditionally, CrowdStrike recently partnered with Nvidia to provide customers with access to accelerated infrastructure and software, letting businesses build custom AI security applications trained on their own data. That value proposition creates new monetization opportunities for CrowdStrike, and it could certainly attract new customers.\n\nWall Street expects CrowdStrike to grow revenue at 29% annually over the next five years, which makes its current valuation of 26.4 times sales look tolerable. That said, like Datadog, this stock is not cheap, and volatility is to be expected. But CrowdStrike and Datadog are high-quality companies with good shots at creating significant shareholder value. Patient investors should feel comfortable buying small positions in this growth stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Datadog right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Datadog, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Datadog wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 best affordable stocks under $10. To skip the detailed analysis of current economic conditions and experts\u2019 outlook around them, go directly to the 5 Best Affordable Stocks Under $10.\n\nOn March 20, the Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, highlighted that the economy remains strong with substantial easing of inflation along with a robust labor market. However, he said that inflation remains relatively high compared to the Fed\u2019s longer-run goal of 2 percent and that future inflation trends could remain uncertain. The Fed chair highlighted that the unemployment rate has been relatively low at 3.9%, and job gains have averaged around 265,000 over the last three months.\n\nMoreover, the Fed shed light on the US GDP growth and its outlook, stating that the GDP growth reached 3.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and predicted a slowdown in the near future. The committee is expecting a median projection of 2.1% GDP growth for 2024 and 2% for the following two years. The Fed maintained the overnight federal funds rate at the current range of 5.25% to 5.5%, and the committee still projects three rate cuts this year. Nevertheless, Jerome Powell said that it will still depend upon incoming data.\n\nMarket Outlook According to Experts\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance, chief economist of Annex Wealth Management, Brian Jacobsen, said their committee has been in discussion about \u201cwhere the market narrative might shift towards,\u201d and pointed toward the small-cap space. Jacobsen\u2019s team also has a bullish view of the industrials, materials, and utilities sectors. He highlighted that these three sectors have underperformed and that the utilities sector could benefit a lot in case of interest rate stability or cuts. Brian Jacobsen said that the materials and industrials sectors are more \u201ccyclically oriented\u201d, and if manufacturing gets out of the \u201clong hibernation\u201d it has experienced, both sectors could even outperform for three years.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the underperformance of the materials and industrial sectors compared to the broader market in 2023, both of them are competing fairly well in 2024. Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLB) has been up 8.5% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 10.08% gain as of March 27. On the other hand, the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) has outperformed the S&P 500 with an 11.61% year-to-date gain.\n\nJeremy Siegel, Wharton School finance professor, told CNBC on March 27 that he is still optimistic about the US economy, and it isn\u2019t showing any signs of weakness. He said that he wouldn\u2019t be surprised about a little correction in the market, but the current bull market is strong and has \u201cways to go\u201d. Professor Siegel also commented on Morgan Stanley\u2019s executive chairman James Morgan's statement about not being shocked if the Fed doesn\u2019t cut rates for the whole year. He said it is possible, but he thinks it is unlikely and \u201cagainst the odds.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Elizabeth Evans, Managing Partner of Evans May Wealth, said in a CNBC interview on March 27 that the market is due for a pullback, and her company is suggesting the clients take a time-out and make some adjustments. Evans\u2019 firm is bullish on mega-cap tech stocks along with D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) and CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD).\n\nD.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is a Texas-based home-builder that has built over 1 million homes as of 2023 and has been the largest home-builder in the US by volume for over two decades. On January 29, Argus raised its FY24 EPS outlook for the stock to $13.72 from $12.50. Argus believes that D.R. Horton, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:DHI) strength lies in delivering affordable homes, as approximately 68% of its homes sold for less than $400,000 in FY23. This positioning indicates the company\u2019s readiness to cater to value-conscious buyers.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a well-known name in the cyber-security space, providing endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyber attack response services. Over the last three months, Wall Street has been quite bullish on the company\u2019s stock, with 39 out of 41 analysts maintaining a Buy-equivalent rating on the stock, according to TipRanks.

        "content": "While macroeconomic uncertainty has put pressure on many businesses\u2019 budgets, cybersecurity continues to be important as ever. Vast amounts of enterprises are pursuing digital transformation, and many aspects of life are online now, which means these pools of data need to be secured efficiently. In other words, cybersecurity is essential to protect the infrastructure that supports the digital world on which we rely heavily, but not all stocks in this space are thriving. Below are three sorry\u00a0cybersecurity stocks to sell while you still can.\n\nRapid7 (RPD) Cybersecurity Stocks. AI stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) is a cloud cybersecurity company specializing in vulnerability management, threat detection and response solutions. The company\u2019s Insight platform attempts to provide customers with a holistic cloud solution for a variety of cybersecurity needs.\n\nRapid7 experienced strong growth during the years preceding and following the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the rise of interest rates and the deteriorating economic environment that ensued has put cybersecurity stocks to sell in jeopardy, as their business models rely on constant customer acquisition. This is underscored by Rapid7\u2019s Q4 earnings report. While revenue and EPS came in ahead of estimates, the company issued weak guidance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis indicates many cybersecurity firms are not out of the woods yet in terms of the macroeconomic environment. To underscore the point, Rapid7\u2019s revenue growth halved from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023. In particular, in 2023, top-line figures grew 13.5% on a year-over-year basis, well below revenue growth figures generated in prior fiscal years, which tended to be between 25-35%.\n\nRPD shares have fallen nearly 12.43% on a year-to-date (YTD) perspective. Investors still holding the stock now would probably be better off absorbing their losses and moving on to better performers in the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSentinelOne (NYSE:S) is a global provider of cloud-based cybersecurity solutions, best-known for its \u2018Singularity Extended Detection and Response Platform\u2019. The concept leverages artificial intelligence to power cybersecurity solutions on an organization\u2019s cloud network.\n\nSingularity\u2019s value proposition was simple. AI technology would create a human-like experience for the platform\u2019s users, thus significantly decreasing upfront costs for customers. Addressing this pain-point in cybersecurity, SentinelOne roared into prominence with a record\u00a0$1.2 billion in its 2021 initial public offering. Back then, Sentinel was posting triple-digit revenue growth and was a force to be reckoned with.\n\nIn its recent Q4 earnings report, while financial figures did come in above what Wall Street had been estimating, guidance for the company\u2019s following fiscal year was not sorely underwhelming. SentinelOne expects to grow revenue by 36% year-over-year in fiscal year 2025, but this growth rate is also below that of prior years. This, again, highlights the cybersecurity market participants are still embroiled in macroeconomic uncertainty and intense competition, especially with fast-growing competitors like CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) snapping up market share.\n\nTenable (TENB) A person holding a tablet with a key lock hologram floating above it. Represents cybersecurity stocks.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTenable Holdings (NASDAQ:TENB) has been another promising cloud-based cybersecurity platform. The platform specializes in \u201cexposure management\u201d solutions, which help companies to identify cybersecurity vulnerabilities in their private and public cloud infrastructure. The firm\u2019s turnkey solutions were in high demand during the pandemic as many enterprises accelerated their cloud migration plans.\n\nIn October 2022, Tenable slightly shifted strategy and\u00a0announced \u2018Tenable One\u2019 which would unify all existing solutions onto the platform. This unification strategy seems to be working out well for them. In its recent fourth quarter earnings print, revenue and EPS figures came in above Wall Street estimates, driven by \u201cstrength\u201d in the Tenable One platform.\n\nDespite a successful quarter, revenue growth has continued to trail prior years. In 2023, top-line figures grew year-over-year by 19%, while growth in prior years had been solidly in the mid-to-high 20 percentage points. the company\u2019s share price has certainly underperformed the market. TENB has risen just about 10.34% YTD, which means its trailing the Nasdaq and S&P500. Tenable\u2019s relatively high multiple also could complicate a potential share price recovery.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Adobe's Moat Is in Creative Solutions, but Its Enterprise Offerings Are Under Threat",
        "content": "Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is an older but highly valuable investment in digital software suites, including a specific moat in advanced digital creative design studios, where I believe it is unmatched by any peers. However, it faces threats in its digital experience offerings related to broader enterprise solutions. While I consider the stock to be undervalued at this time, the premium over its wider industry adds somewhat more risk to the investment.\n\nOverview and updates\n\nAdobe is one of the most prominent companies in the technology industry, with a main role in digital content creation. Here is a brief breakdown of its core areas of expertise:\n\nDigital Media: Operations from its Creative Cloud, including Photoshop, Illustrator and Premiere Pro. Digital Experience: Offers an integrated platform for analytics, commerce, marketing and customer engagement. Publishing and Advertising: E-learning solutions, technical document publishing, web conferencing and other solutions.\n\nFor fiscal fourth-quarter 2023, the company reported record revenue of $5.05 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 12%. It has set its target total revenue in the range of $5.10 billion to $5.15 billion for the first quarter of 2024, highlighting expectations for significant growth in its Digital Media and Digital Experience segments.\n\nNotably, its Digital Media segment is supported by artificial intelligence through integrations into its software products. In particular, it introduced Firefly, a generative AI platform developed to empower creative, development and marketing workflows. During the Adobe MAX 2023 event, the company unveiled three new AI models:\n\nFirefly Image 2 Model: Generates high-quality images, improving rendering and creative control. Adobe Firefly Vector Model: Creates vector graphics through text prompts, simplifying the design process for creating logos and icons. Adobe Firefly Design Model: Enables the instant generation of design templates from text descriptions, streamlining marketing and design operations.\n\nStory continues\n\nI believe each of these advances is a critical step in the right direction for Adobe, but I also think the company still has some way to go in terms of mastering the art of prompt-generated creativity. As is the same in the writing industry, it is next to impossible in visual arts to get high-caliber results from artificial intelligence. Arguably, this is something that will be developed in time, but Adobe will have a significant role in how it balances the art of artificial assistance in visual creativity with high levels of involvement from creative directors, balancing between efficiency and human creative vision. It is awfully easy to sacrifice the vision part for efficiency, and I believe Adobe has to be careful not to cheapen its brand at this time by focusing too intently on quick results from its programs rather than adding depth to creative capabilities.\n\nMarket and competition\n\nWhat I find particularly interesting about Adobe is that it is unique in its operational scope. Few, if any, companies of its size command the areas of operation it specifically caters to. Arguably, no other company on the planet offers a comprehensive creative suite quite like Adobe, as it focuses on the elite visual creator. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have capabilities similar to Adobe's offerings, but it offers a more concentrated tool base for the top-end professional. Apple and Microsoft's offerings are widely scattered and not focused enough on this demographic to have any real, lasting competitive value in the area.\n\nThere are also smaller competitors, like Canva and Affinity by Serif. While Canva is evidently catered toward novice designers, Affinity directly competes with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, but distinctly at a one-time purchase price. It is considered a cost-effective alternative to Adobe Illustrator in particular, and it has positive reviews, but users have also noted some limitations, including performance dips on Windows.\n\nNonetheless, I assess Adobe to be a one-of-a-kind and high-operational value technology company with minimal direct competitors, allowing it to command a strong moat in its specific niche of advanced visual design. Adobe Experience Cloud, on the other hand, faces more distinct competitors, including from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). I believe its digital experience offerings are much more prone to competitive risks than its creative suite, given such an aggressive advance from multiple companies in the space at this time.\n\nFinancials\n\nFor the purposes of this analysis, I have chosen to compare Adobe to Salesforce, SAP and ServiceNow. While I understand the overlap is not ideal, I believe it offers a valid peer comparison for the analysis of opportunity cost. Each of these is of similar market cap, and I believe they are all highly compelling investments, to varying degrees, at a time of heightened adoption of AI.\n\nFirst of all, let's take a snapshot of the core financial statistics of each of these peers:\n\nAdobe: Equity-to-asset ratio of 0.56, net margin of 27.97%, three-year revenue growth rate of 16.8% and forward price-earnings ratio of 28.66. Salesforce: Equity-to-asset ratio of 0.6, net margin of 11.87%, three-year revenue growth rate of 15.7% and forward price-earnings ratio of 30.88. SAP: Equity-to-asset ratio of 0.63, net margin of 20.68%, three-year revenue growth rate of 4.6% and forward price-earnings ratio of 37.30. ServiceNow: Equity-to-asset ratio of 0.44, net margin of 19.30%, three-year revenue growth rate of 25% and forward price-earnings ratio of 57.08.\n\nAdobe is evidently in a very strong position with an immensely high growth rate, considering how long it has been around in comparison to the other companies in my peer analysis. ServiceNow particularly shines for being high growth, but this is to be expected; the company is fairly new, with its initial public offering in 2012. Adobe, on the other hand, had its IPO in 1986. Yet, I consider all of these companies to have remarkably strong financial profiles in general. Where Adobe particularly stands out is in the relative stability of the balance sheet alongside competitive growth that is expected to continue at an earnings per share without non-recurring items compound annual growth rate of 14% over the next three reports, based on consensus analyst estimates.\n\nThe company has a significant tendency to perform share buybacks, buying its own stock at varying and often very high amounts, like in 2022 when it bought back $6.55 billion worth. I believe this is an excellent investment from the company to bolster long-term equity value for shareholders, and thankfully its balance sheet, not too overburdened by debt, warrants this kind of action without it negatively impacting its overall financial health too significantly.\n\nValuation\n\nOver the past 10 years, Adobe has had a median price-earnings ratio of 53.14. At this time, its price-earnings ratio is 43.49, which indicates a discount from the valuation typical for the stock of 18.16%.\n\nWe can also compare Adobe to its competitors to gauge what is normal for the group. The average forward price-earnings ratio of Salesforce, SAP and ServiceNow is 32.28. Adobe has a forward price-earnings ratio at this time of 28.66, which is 11.21% lower than its peers on average.\n\nMy current estimate is a median of these two figures, an estimated margin of safety in the present stock price of around 15%. Investors should understand my value analysis and associated safety margin do not include an analysis of intrinsic value, and the reason I have left this out is because of the high premium investors are willing to pay for the stock, which unfortunately seems to nullify a discounted cash flow analysis at the time of writing.\n\nMy value analysis and associated conclusion of Adobe's undervaluation, therefore, come with more risk for downside volatility as a result of significant shifts in investor sentiment that may occur. However, it should be noted that shifts in purchase sentiment can also be as random as shifts in investor sentiment, meaning my valuation method has considerable weight against a DCF analysis.\n\nRisks\n\nOther than the associated risk with my valuation method, Adobe faces a few critical company-specific risks, including rapid changes in the generative AI and co-pilot technology landscape, which has the potential over time to make an investment quite obsolete if it does not successfully hire experts in new fields of advanced capabilities. Other peers who have the potential to take market share through potential expansion strategies, particularly as it relates to digital experience, include CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) and Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), all serious threats in terms of intelligent data analysis and security-of-software processes. Many of these new platforms offer a one-point solution for all enterprise software needs, significantly challenging some of Adobe's offerings.\n\nAdditionally, there are threats to Adobe's creative tools, including from OpenAI and its suite of image creation tools, but also its new Sora technology, which has the ability to smart-render video from text prompts. I believe Adobe is significantly behind OpenAI. And with the backing of Microsoft, I highly doubt that Adobe will be able to remain at the cutting edge of advanced AI generation like OpenAI will. Still, Adobe will likely remain a vital tool for creative professionals if it can continue to corner the market of advanced, highly professional digital imaging with a full breadth of capabilities. This is something OpenAI does not even scratch the surface of at present.\n\nConclusion\n\nAdobe is a unique company that is positioned particularly well in digital creative design studios, where its moat commands lasting shareholder value. Yet the threats to its other enterprise solutions offerings are significant and I think the company would be wise to focus on its core moat in creative solutions, as I see a considerable likelihood that it will be outcompeted in terms of its broader analytics and customer relationship management efforts. While this may cause some slower growth for Adobe long term, the overall operations look positioned to continue succeeding, at least for now. At this time, I rate the stock a buy with a caveat to watch carefully where it places its strategic focus moving forward.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

Sophisticated attacks are being increasingly made, some of which are based on the breacher\u2019s artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nA report by Statista reflects that the global cybersecurity market is expected to hit $183.1 billion in 2024 and $273.5 billion by 2028, witnessing a CAGR of 10.6%. This presents an opportunity for companies working in this space, including CRWD.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the company is dealing with increased competition in security applications and overspending in sales, marketing and research. These challenges are worsened by reduced IT spending due to economic conditions, which could harm its short-term outlook. Despite these difficulties, CrowdStrike's Falcon XDR platform and 10 other cloud modules provide a competitive edge in the market.\n\nZacks Rank and Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, CrowdStrike carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of CRWD have skyrocketed 147.2% in the past year.\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the broader technology sector are BlackLine BL, Arista Networks ANET and Dell Technologies DELL, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

        "content": "Cybersecurity plays an ever-increasing role in our daily lives. Sure, the latest PC you bought or the application you downloaded adds a lot of joy to your life. However, lurking in the shadows are bad guys trying to tap into your privacy.\n\nSo, a surge in cybercrime prompts a rise in cybersecurity. The industry is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate of\u00a011.44% until 2029, presenting secular growth opportunities.\n\nAmong numerous industry constituents, three best-in-class cybersecurity stocks stand out. Each asset hosts solid fundamentals and aligned quantitative metrics. So, let\u2019s delve into the three best cybersecurity picks to buy this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an integrated cybersecurity company primarily offering cloud workload and endpoint, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response. Unlike most cyber companies, Crowdstrike provides affordable products and services, allowing succinct customer switching. The firm\u2019s high-quality, fair-cost model has led to secular growth which looks set to continue.\n\nThe company\u2019s latest earnings report illustrated the aforementioned. Crowdstrike\u2019s fourth-quarter report communicated annual recurring revenue of $3.44 billion, a 34.4% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Furthermore, CRWD retained an 80% subscription gross profit margin, suggesting economies of scale are en route.\n\nApproximately 94.16% of the company\u2019s revenue derives from subscriptions. However, the artificial intelligence (AI) boom provides its Professional Services Segment with significant potential. Despite AI\u2019s popularity, corporate AI transition is complex and generally assisted by cyber companies. Will Crowdstrike leverage this market? It is highly likely.\n\nCRWD is grossly undervalued. For instance, its price-to-sales ratio of 25.58x is at a five-year discount near 12%. Moreover, the stock is trading above its 10-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages, indicating a momentum trend has occurred.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) operates in the advanced firewall and adjacent cloud-based business. The company hosts best-in-class status with a scintillating return on common equity ratio of\u00a089.52%. Additionally, the stock is highly touted on Wall Street, with numerous analysts backing it to succeed throughout 2024.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a few of the calls on Wall Street to set a baseline.\n\nEdward Stanley of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently added Palo Alto Networks to a list of \u201chigh productivity\u201d plays. The basis of Stanley\u2019s argument stems from AI integration and the phenomenon\u2019s operational efficiency benefits. Furthermore, Argus emphasized its bullish outlook on PANW earlier this month, upgrading PANW\u2019s price target to $336 from a previous $290 based on demand factors.\n\nMany investors are worried about Palo Alto Networks\u2019 strategy shift. In an announcement last month, Palo Alto\u2019s management indicated a pivot to provide more free offerings. This could potentially dent its billings by $600 million toward the back end of this year. However, this is a temporary change in strategy to stimulate long-term demand. Basically, Palo Alto\u2019s decision is long-term value-driven. Further, the firm has a cash position of nearly\u00a0$3.37\u00a0billion.\n\nAlso, the stock has a price-to-earnings-growth ratio of\u00a00.01x,\u00a0and the company has a five-year compound annual growth rate of\u00a023.75%. Considering these metrics alongside Palo Alto Networks\u2019 fundamentals, consider it a growth-at-a-reasonable price opportunity.\n\nRadware (RDWR) An image of a shield hovering above a motherboard with a forcefield surrounding it, a person holding a tablet stands facing it\n\nSource: Ico Maker / Shutterstock\n\nRadware (NASDAQ:RDWR) is primarily known for protecting against identity theft, protection against malicious user behavior, and related cloud protection services. Although mostly used for Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) applications, Radware is positioned for future expansion, providing its investors with much to anticipate.\n\nThe company and the stock alike possess numerous tailwinds. First, Radware recently signed a downstream agreement with Spark NZ. This allows Spark to re-sell its services throughout New Zealand, providing Radware with geographic diversification. Furthermore, Radware released its fourth-quarter earnings, beating its revenue target by $990,000 and its earnings target by one cent per share.\n\nFurthermore, its annual recurring revenue grew by 22% YOY. Moreover, RDWR has a price-to-sales ratio of merely 3.12x. Is RDWR undervalued? I certainly think so.\n\nOn the date of publication, Steve Booyens did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Supercharged Tech Stocks to Buy Without Any Hesitation",
        "content": "With the Nasdaq Composite index soaring about 60% from its bear market lows, it has become increasingly difficult to find reasonably priced tech stocks. However, by focusing on fast-growing businesses operating in markets with decades-long tailwinds, investors can locate a handful of top-tier stocks with reasonable valuations.\n\nCrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) and Clear Secure (NYSE: YOU) are two companies that fit this bill, growing sales by 36% and 40%, respectively, in 2023. Both are in cybersecurity: CrowdStrike's platform reduces the number of vendors a company needs to protect itself from threats, and Clear Secure's biometric identity solutions make security checkpoints easier to manage.\n\nHere's the case for buying these two supercharged tech stocks today. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCrowdStrike: The cybersecurity consolidator\n\nPowered by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), CrowdStrike's Falcon platform offers over 20 modules -- unique cybersecurity products -- to its customers. Covering areas like cloud and endpoint security, threat exposure management, and information technology (IT) automation, CrowdStrike's multitude of modules makes it a perfect choice for vendor consolidation.\n\nA recent study by research firm Gartner found that 75% of businesses are\u00a0seeking to consolidate the number of cybersecurity vendors they work with. Against that backdrop, CrowdStrike's breadth of offerings is becoming increasingly valuable. In fact, 64% of the company's customers already use five or more modules, and 27% use seven or more, highlighting CrowdStrike's consolidating prowess. With most clients adopting many modules, the company has 580 customers spending over $1 million annually across its platform, which grew by 33% in 2023.\n\nThis long list of clients gives the company a massive trove of data to feed back into its AI-powered threat graph. Filtering through over 1 trillion data points daily, the company grows more robust with each new customer it adds and each new module its clients buy. As its network grows stronger with each customer and module added, it becomes a more attractive offering to prospective clients, creating a virtuous cycle.\n\nStory continues\n\nPowered by this burgeoning network effect, CrowdStrike has seen its revenue rise 12-fold since its 2019 initial public offering, propelling its share price up over 400% over the same time.\n\nThis leaves the young cybersecurity company trading with a seemingly hefty market cap of roughly $78 billion at recent prices. However, with consulting firm McKinsey projecting the cybersecurity industry to grow from $150 billion today to between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion over the long term, this market cap could prove comically undersized by 2034.\n\nHome to a long list of awards and leadership designations from research firms like Gartner and Forrester, CrowdStrike is well positioned to remain the most significant disruptor in the cybersecurity space. This leadership recognition, paired with the company's growing array of modules, its ever-expanding network, and impressive ability to generate free cash flow (about one-third of revenue this past year), make CrowdStrike the perfect tech stock to buy today and add to over time.\n\nClear Secure: High growth, abundant cash, and a low valuation\n\nWhereas CrowdStrike aims to serve as many customers in as many cybersecurity niches as possible, Clear Secure has one primary focus: identity verification. Best known for its 147 Clear Plus members-only priority lanes in 56 airports across the United States, Clear Secure helps its members quickly pass through security checkpoints using its biometric identity verification capabilities.\n\nFor $189 annually, customers can access these priority lanes by uploading a driver's license or passport on the Clear mobile app or at an airport kiosk. This time-saving and stress-reducing solution has proven to be a no-brainer for frequent flyers, with Clear Secure now home to 6.7 million paying members, which grew by 31% in 2023.\n\nIn addition to these members, the company counts 13 million non-paying members who use the Clear app to get flight details such as gate numbers or the estimated walking time to a terminal. This \"Home to Gate\" feature pairs perfectly with the company's free Reserve solution, which lets members book a time to go through security (but not be expedited through, like a Clear Plus member).\n\nBest yet for investors, the company has ambitions to expand its identity verification prowess into new channels. Through its business-to-business product, Clear Verified, the company has partnered with enterprises in pro sports leagues, e-commerce, retail, financial services, hospitality, and healthcare. One major success story in this new growth area is its partnership with LinkedIn, where members could affirm their identities for free through Clear Secure and receive an indicator of their verification on the site.\n\nArmed with this growing number of use cases, it may be no surprise to learn that Clear Secure's revenue grew by 40% in 2023. While this growth is exciting in its own right, it was possibly outshined by the company's ballooning free cash flow margin of 33%. YOU Owners' Cash Profits Margin (TTM) Chart\n\nAnd these results should not be a one-time feat. In fact, this free cash flow -- along with Clear Secure's sales -- should rise by more than 30% in 2024, according to management.\n\nThe cherry on top for investors? Despite this shift toward powerful cash creation, the company trades at a cheap valuation of just 9 times FCF. YOU Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nArmed with over $700 million in cash and marketable securities, no debt, and nearly $200 million in FCF coming through the door in 2023, management boosted its share repurchase authorization to $128 million, to take advantage of today's low valuation. On top of these buybacks, this cash hoard should easily fund a growing dividend that yields around 1.3% at recent prices -- especially as these payouts only use 16% of Clear Secure's annual FCF.\n\nThis combination of high sales growth, strong FCF generation, abundant cash returns to shareholders, and a discounted valuation makes Clear Secure a stellar tech stock to buy without hesitation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Cybersecurity Trends: Top 10 ETFs For Cyber Defense",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 ETFs for cyber defense. If you want to skip our discussion on the cybersecurity industry, head over to Cybersecurity Trends: Top 5 ETFs For Cyber Defense.\n\nIn 2024, Gartnerpredicts several significant cybersecurity trends driven by Generative AI (GenAI), unsecure employee behavior, third-party risks, continuous threat exposure, boardroom communication gaps, and identity-first security approaches. These trends include the rapid evolution of Generative AI, increasing reliance on outcome-driven metrics (ODMs) to demonstrate cybersecurity investment's tangible protection levels, a shift towards behavioral change to reduce cybersecurity risks, the emphasis on resilience-oriented investments in light of third-party cybersecurity incidents, the adoption of continuous threat exposure management (CTEM) to evaluate and mitigate asset vulnerabilities, and the rising importance of an identity-first approach to security, particularly focusing on Identity and Access Management (IAM) to improve cybersecurity and business outcomes.\n\nIn recent years, the cybersecurity economy has experienced rapid growth, outpacing the overall world economy significantly. However, this growth has been uneven, with larger and more developed economies reaping most benefits while others lag behind. The 2024 Global Cybersecurity Outlook (GCO) by the World Economic Forumhighlights a concerning trend \u2013 organizations maintaining minimum viable cyber resilience are rapidly diminishing, down 31% since 2022. This widening gap between cyber-resilient organizations and those struggling to keep pace poses serious threats to the integrity of the entire cybersecurity ecosystem.\n\nThe uneven distribution of cyber resilience can be attributed to several factors. One significant factor is the cost associated with accessing cyber services, tools, and talent. Larger and more financially robust organizations are better equipped to invest in robust cybersecurity measures, leaving smaller and less affluent organizations at a disadvantage. Additionally, disparities in cyber skills and insurance adoption further exacerbate the divide. Smaller organizations, which are often more vulnerable to cyber threats, are three times less likely to carry cyber insurance compared to larger enterprises, creating a significant gap in risk mitigation strategies. Geographical disparities also play a role, with regions like Latin America and Africa reporting fewer cyber-resilient organizations compared to North America and Europe. This \"cybersecurity poverty line\" not only reflects financial constraints but also encompasses issues like the cyber skills gap and access to innovative technologies. The lack of sufficient cyber resilience among smaller organizations is particularly troubling, given the interconnected nature of the digital ecosystem. Despite some organizations seeing improvements in cyber resilience, the overall trend indicates a widening gap between cyber-resilient leaders and those struggling to adapt. While competition is healthy in traditional economic contexts, cyber leaders recognize that the interconnectedness of the digital landscape makes this growing divide more harmful than beneficial.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai believes that rapid advancements in artificial intelligence could play a crucial role in bolstering defenses against cybersecurity threats. Despite concerns about the potential misuse of AI, Pichai contends that these intelligence tools could aid governments and businesses in accelerating the detection and response to threats posed by hostile actors in cyberspace. Cybersecurity attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated, with malicious actors increasingly leveraging them to exert power and extort money. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, these attacks cost the global economy an estimated $8 trillion in 2023, a figure projected to rise to $10.5 trillion by 2025. While some, like Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, warn that AI may exacerbate these threats by lowering the barriers to entry for cyber hackers, Pichai argues that AI can also reduce the time required for defenders to identify and counter attacks, thereby mitigating the defenders\u2019 dilemma. To address these challenges, Google has launched a new initiative offering AI tools and infrastructure investments aimed at enhancing online security. One such tool, Magika, is an open-source tool designed to detect malware, while a white paper proposes measures and research to safeguard AI. These efforts coincide with a pact signed by major companies at the Munich Security Conference to prevent AI tools from being used to disrupt democratic processes, particularly in the upcoming 2024 election year.\n\nSome of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy include Fortinet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT), Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation (NYSE:BAH), and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW). However, we discuss the best cybersecurity ETFs in this article.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best cybersecurity ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the 5-year share price performance of each ETF as of March 21, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors.  Cybersecurity Trends: Top ETFs For Cyber Defense\n\nPhoto by Kaur Kristjan on Unsplash\n\nCybersecurity Trends: Top ETFs for Cyber Defense\n\n10. Themes Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:SPAM)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 21: 10.27%\n\nThemes Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:SPAM) aims to mirror the performance of the Solactive Cybersecurity Index, which is composed of the top 35 digital security software companies by market capitalization. Launched on December 8, 2023, Themes Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:SPAM) seeks to match the price and yield of its benchmark index, with an expense ratio of 0.35%. It is one of the best cybersecurity ETFs to invest in.\n\nOkta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) is one of the top holdings of Themes Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:SPAM). Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) operates globally as an identity management company, offering a suite of products and services to manage and secure user identities. On February 29, Okta shares experienced a premarket surge of over 20% following an upgrade from BofA. BofA raised Okta's rating from Underperform to Buy and set a price target of $135, citing strong fourth-quarter performance and the possibility of continued outperformance in the upcoming fiscal year.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 47 hedge funds were bullish on Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA), same as the prior quarter.\n\nIn addition to Fortinet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT), Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation (NYSE:BAH), and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) is one of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nMeridian Growth Fund made the following comment about Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOkta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) is the largest independent identity software company, serving enterprises, small- and medium-sized businesses, universities, non-profits, and government agencies across the globe. Its solutions provide higher-level security authentication services, a business-critical function that has the attention of CEOs and IT leaders everywhere. The company\u2019s integration with 7,000 other software vendors and system providers is a competitive advantage that enables rapid and seamless implementations. Okta\u2019s complete product suite allows customers to deploy an enterprise-wide identity platform that serves both the workforce segment (clients\u2019 employees) and the customer segments (clients\u2019 customers). The stock has started to recover after falling nearly 85% from post-COVID bubble levels due to a stabilization in the overall macro environment for security services. The company has also seen a normalization in salesforce attrition which had hampered growth. The stock moved higher during the quarter when it reported higher than expected revenues and a much-improved adjusted operating margin of 11% versus -3% in the prior year quarter. Beyond its core capabilities, which are in high demand, we are also encouraged by the company\u2019s ability to expand into product adjacencies such as privileged access management and identity governance. Due to these improving fundamentals, we added to our position in the company during the period.\u201d\n\n9. CI Digital Security Index ETF (TSE:CBUG.TO)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 21: 21.45%\n\nCI Digital Security Index ETF (TSE:CBUG.TO) aims to replicate the performance of a global digital security industry index, after deducting expenses. It mirrors the Solactive Digital Security CAD Hedged Index, which tracks companies operating in the global digital security industry using the ARTIS classification system. The index also hedges foreign currency exposure to Canadian dollars. Established on February 24, 2022, CI Digital Security Index ETF (TSE:CBUG.TO) charges a management fee of 0.40%. As of March 20, 2024, its net assets amount to C$2.50 million.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is the largest holding of CI Digital Security Index ETF (TSE:CBUG.TO). CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity solutions provider operating globally. On March 6, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) garnered attention after surpassing expectations in both fourth-quarter results and guidance, earning praise from Wall Street. J.P. Morgan analyst Brian Essex noted the company's progress towards a $100 billion market cap, citing improved growth, profitability, and free cash flow. He maintained an Overweight rating on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) and raised the price target to $371 from $350.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 62 hedge funds were long CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), compared to 69 funds in the last quarter.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cImproving unit economics: Many of our companies were able to significantly expand margins during 2023 even though revenue growth decelerated for some of them, showcasing the power of their capital-light, recurring revenue business models, and their increased focus on efficiency. Another example is the cybersecurity platform, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), which is expected to increase its operating margins from 15.9% in 2022 to 20.8% in 2023 as a result of growing efficiencies, while the company\u2019s platform offering is resonating with an increasing number of customers (for example, deals with eight or more modules grew 78% year-over-year in the last quarter), which is a tailwind to sales productivity.\u201d\n\n8. Xtrackers Cybersecurity Select Equity ETF (NASDAQ:PSWD)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 21: 22.65%\n\nXtrackers Cybersecurity Select Equity ETF (NASDAQ:PSWD) ranks 8th on our list of the best cybersecurity ETFs. Xtrackers Cybersecurity Select Equity ETF (NASDAQ:PSWD) aims to match the performance of the Solactive Cyber Security ESG Screened Index, before fees and expenses. The ETF had net assets totaling $6.20 million as of March 20, 2024, with a net expense ratio of 0.20%. The fund was launched on July 13, 2023. It is one of the best cybersecurity ETFs to invest in.\n\nCyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) is one of the top holdings of Xtrackers Cybersecurity Select Equity ETF (NASDAQ:PSWD). The company develops and sells software-based identity security solutions globally. On February 8, CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.81 and a revenue of $223.1 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.34 and $13.36 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 50 hedge funds were bullish on CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR), up from 32 funds in the last quarter. Robert G. Moses\u2019 RGM Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1 million shares worth $221.2 million.\n\nBaron Discovery Fund made the following comment about CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe initiated a position in CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR), an identity security platform focused primarily on privileged access management (PAM). CyberArk\u2019s PAM technology prevents bad actors from stealing and exploiting the credentials of superuser accounts like IT administrators, cybersecurity managers, and network administrators. These privileged accounts can access a company\u2019s most critical IT systems\u2013domain directory servers (all passwords, profiles, and data on employees), firewalls, code repositories, and database servers\u2013making the credentials a high-value target in ransomware attacks (consulting firm Forrester estimates that 80% of security breaches involve privileged credentials). CyberArk technology detects, stores, and manages all the privileged credentials in an organization, monitors the critical IT systems, and helps contain the damage hackers can cause if they breach a corporate network. The increasing frequency and severity of ransomware attacks, heightening geopolitical tension, and stricter requirements of cyber insurance policies have all made PAM a higher priority spending category among security teams.\n\nCyberArk is the market leader in the PAM category, with over 20% market share. The company has successfully leveraged its foothold to expand into complementary markets like identity and access management (authentication of a company\u2019s employees and vendors), secrets management (detection of credentials used for machine-to-machine communications), and endpoint management. These newer solutions now account for over 45% of annual subscription recurring revenue and are growing over 100% annually. CyberArk is also making good progress in its business model transition from on-premise (one-time perpetual license payment plus some recurring maintenance payments) to a recurring subscription revenue model. The new model expands CyberArk\u2019s addressable market, enables it to cross-sell products more efficiently, increases the lifetime value of its customers, and improves revenue predictability. Recurring revenue now accounts for more than 84% of total sales and annualized recurring revenue has been growing over 40% for the past four quarters. As subscription contracts come up for renewal in the next two to three years, we expect cash-flow margins to increase from mid-single digits today to CyberArk\u2019s healthy historical margin levels of 20%-plus. Long term, the combination of resilient end-market growth, better recurring revenue mix, and margin expansion should bode well for the stock.\u201d\n\n7. iShares Digital Security UCITS ETF USD Dist (LON:SHLG.L)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 21: 23.92%\n\nRanking 7th on our list of the best cybersecurity ETFs is iShares Digital Security UCITS ETF USD Dist (LON:SHLG.L). iShares Digital Security UCITS ETF USD Dist (LON:SHLG.L) aims to mirror the performance of an index consisting of developed and emerging market companies with substantial revenues from digital security sectors.

(NASDAQ:NTNX), compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter. David Blood and Al Gore\u2019s Generation Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 17.25 million shares worth $823 million.\n\nCarillon Chartwell Small Cap Value Fund made the following comment about Nutanix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTNX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWithin the Carillon Chartwell Small Cap Growth Fund, information technology and industrials were the strongest-performing sectors, with strong stock selection leading to alpha generation. The new management team at Nutanix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTNX) continues to execute well, delivering another positive quarterly earnings surprise. Nutanix\u2019s core hyper converged infrastructure (HCI) technology continues to gain market share over its competitors.\u201d\n\n6. Global X Defense Tech ETF (NYSE:SHLD)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 21: 31.14%\n\nGlobal X Defense Tech ETF (NYSE:SHLD) ranks 6th on our list of the best cybersecurity ETFs to buy.

Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with approximately 9 million shares worth $755.4 million.\n\nLike Fortinet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT), Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation (NYSE:BAH), and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), hedge funds are piling into RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).\n\nMatrix Asset Advisors made the following comment about RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn Q3, we started a new position in RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), formerly Raytheon Technologies, an aerospace and defense company that provides advanced systems and services for commercial, military and government customers worldwide. The company was formed in 2020 through the combination of Raytheon Company and the United Technologies Corporation aerospace businesses. We had previously owned United Technologies and were impressed with their CEO, Greg Hayes, now the CEO of RTX. The opportunity to purchase RTX came after the company disclosed a problem with an engine component that will result in a significant charge to inspect and replace. This is a fixable issue requiring time and money, but we believe the price decline provided a good opportunity to start a position in this highly profitable, well-managed company.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see Cybersecurity Trends: Top 10 ETFs For Cyber Defense.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 Best States for Homeowners Insurance in the US 12 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds 11 Best Healthcare ETFs To Buy Now\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks to Buy Beyond the Mega-Cap Heavyweights",
        "content": "The Magnificent Seven stocks continue to generate a fair amount of ink in the media. And for good reason. The seven mega-cap tech stocks were responsible for nearly two-thirds of the benchmark S&P 500 index\u2019s 24% gain in 2023. Six of the seven stocks can be found among the 10 largest companies in the world based on market capitalization. The stocks dominance and influence is unquestioned.\n\nThat said, there are many smaller tech stocks that are equally appealing and have the potential to offer investors big gains. While these stocks don\u2019t get nearly as much attention, they have proven to be steady outperformers capable of boosting a portfolio\u2019s returns. Here are three tech stocks to buy beyond the mega-cap heavyweights.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nThere\u2019s a buy-the-dip opportunity in Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) after the software company\u2019s stock slid lower following lackluster forward guidance that disappointed Wall Street. ADBE stock is down 10% on the year. A number of analysts are urging investors to see the drop in share price as an opportunity to buy this tech stock. Morningstar just reiterated its price target of $610 a share, implying 18% upside from current levels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company behind popular products such as Photoshop and Illustrator reported strong financial results for fourth quarter 2023. Adobe announced earnings per share (EPS) of $4.48 versus $4.38 that was expected among analysts. Revenue came in at $5.18 billion compared to $5.14 billion that was anticipated. What\u2019s really hurting the stock is that OpenAI has come out with \u201cSora,\u201d a competing AI platform that can generate videos based on written prompts. However, analysts say these fears are overdone.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) have been on fire lately. CRWD stock surged 21% higher in one day recently after the company reported Q4 2023 financial results, which crushed Wall Street estimates. In the last 12 months, CrowdStrike\u2019s stock has increased 141%, making it a top-performing tech stock. Additionally, the company has set itself apart from the rest of the cybersecurity pack.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost recently, CrowdStrike reported EPS of 95 cents compared to the Wall Street expectation of 82 cents. The company\u2019s full-year 2023 revenue rose 36% from 2022 levels to reach $3 billion. In terms of guidance, CrowdStrike expects revenue of $902 million to $906 million in the current first quarter. Management reiterated their goal of achieving $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by 2030.\n\nBlock (SQ) The logo for Block (SQ) is shown on a phone screen with the company's old name and logo, Square, visible behind the phone.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of digital payments firm Block (NYSE:SQ) could be a good way to play the rally this year in cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin (BTC-USD). This is because Block is one of the largest corporate owners of BTC in the world. The company currently owns 8,038 Bitcoin valued at about $520 million. Block reported a surprise Q4 2023 profit, sending its share price up 16%, due largely to a gain in its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe company formerly known as \u201cSquare\u201d reported a profit of 45 cents per share, which was much better than Wall Street forecasts of a 57 cent loss. The surprise profit was due almost entirely to a $207 million gain in the company\u2019s Bitcoin holding during the quarter. The company also said that it made $66 million in profit on Bitcoin sales through its Cash App, a banking platform, which was a 90% increase from a year earlier. Year-to-date, SQ stock is up 10%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "4 Top Tech Stocks That Are Achieving the Best of Both Worlds -- Growing at Over 30% and Maintaining Profitability",
        "content": "For decades, investors have debated whether growth or value stocks are better. But it's a false dichotomy. Investors often wrongly assume that all fast-growing companies just burn cash to gain market share -- and only after a company reaches scale can it pull the profitability lever.\n\nBut it's just not true. Some companies are able to achieve the best of both worlds: growth and profitability. Admittedly, they're not easy to find, but here are four companies growing revenue north of 30% and simultaneously earning real net profits.\n\nLet's take a closer look at cybersecurity specialist CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), learning app Duolingo(NASDAQ: DUOL), fintech company Shift4 Payments(NYSE: FOUR), and app monetization platform AppLovin(NASDAQ: APP).\n\n1. CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike is a cloud-based cybersecurity platform offering enterprises a variety of products. It calls these products \"modules\" and it has more than 20 of them. Customers can start subscriptions out small and add on over time -- and that's exactly what's been happening.\n\nAt the end of its fiscal 2024 on Jan. 31, 64% of CrowdStrike's customers were using at least five of its available modules. Consider that only 62% of its customers used that many at the end of its fiscal 2023. In other words, the company's revenue is growing in part because customers are spending more money as they subscribe to additional modules.\n\nOf course, CrowdStrike is winning new customers as well. This helped push its fiscal 2024 revenue over $3 billion, which was up 36% year over year -- a stellar growth rate. And if it hits the high end of management's guidance for its fiscal 2025, then it will grow revenue by 30% once again.\n\nCrowdStrike stock is up about 150% in the past year, compared to about a 50% return for rival SentinelOne. SentinelOne's growth rate is higher, but investors may prefer CrowdStrike because it's more profitable by a mile. According to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), CrowdStrike had full-year net income of $89 million, compared with a GAAP loss of $339 million for SentinelOne.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Duolingo\n\nCrowdStrike is truly achieving the best of both worlds. But Duolingo sports a faster growth rate and a higher GAAP profit margin, which is worth investors' attention as well.\n\nThe bulk of Duolingo's business revolves around its language learning app, for which it offers both a free ad-supported tier and ad-free paid options. Maybe I'm surprised because I'm cheap. But the company ended 2023 with 6.6 million paid subscribers, which was a staggering 57% increase from the end of 2022.\n\nDuolingo is growing at a stunning pace thanks to its ability to entice its 27 million daily active users to pay for a subscription. The company generated revenue of $531 million in 2023, which was up 44%. And it earned net income of $16 million, which was a 3% profit margin -- just a fractional percentage better than CrowdStrike's margin.\n\nTo be clear, both CrowdStrike and Duolingo are early in their journeys with profitability, so margins should get better with growth. On that note, Duolingo indeed expects to keep growing in the coming year. Management is guiding for full-year 2024 revenue of almost $718 million at the low end of its guidance, implying at least 35% year-over-year growth.\n\n3. Shift4 Payments\n\nOK, so Shift4Payments didn't technically grow by 30% in 2023. Its 29% top-line growth fell just short. But I'll give it a pass because its fourth-quarter revenue was up 31%, and it's guiding for over 30% growth in 2024 as well.\n\nShift4Payments is an often-overlooked fintech player, which is a shame considering its great growth and profitability. The company has a different focus than many of its peers: It focuses on winning huge venues such as Yankee Stadium and large events such as Cirque du Soleil. The company's payment volume is skyrocketing due to winning customers of this caliber.\n\nUnlike some of its fintech peers, very little of Shift4Payments' revenue is subscription-based -- subscription revenue was 7% of gross revenue in 2023. That said, it is fast-growing, with 31% growth in the past year.\n\nTrading at a price-to-sales ratio of about 2, Shift4Payments stock is cheap considering its growth. And indeed, it trades at a discount to some of its most comparable competitors, including Block and Toast. FOUR PS Ratio Chart\n\n4. AppLovin\n\nThe three other stocks featured in this article all have positive returns over the past year. But they don't hold a candle to AppLovin's nearly 400% gain. This stock plummeted in 2022 because it hit a snag with revenue and its losses mounted. But management found its footing in 2023 and is now set up well for 2024.\n\nAppLovin has a portfolio of first-party apps (games) that generate revenue. But its core focus is the discovery and monetization software that it provides to its customers. According to management, it only built first-party apps to experiment with its software -- and it appears its experiments have been wildly successful.\n\nIn 2023, AppLovin's software-platform revenue grew a whopping 46% to $1.8 billion. And its growth rate accelerated throughout the year, hitting 88% for the software segment in the fourth quarter.\n\nTo be clear, revenue stagnation from AppLovin's app business held its full-year revenue down overall -- as a whole, revenue was only up 17% in 2023. But the growth in its software business shouldn't be overlooked. Not only is it surging, but it's also boosting profitability.\n\nFor this article I've highlighted GAAP net income, and AppLovin has it. But there are other important profitability metrics to consider, including free cash flow. Thanks to the growth of its software business, AppLovin's free cash flow surpassed $1 billion in 2023. With its current market valuation of $21 billion, the stock seems fairly valued to me today, even though it's already up so much.\n\nThat brings me to my closing point. CrowdStrike, Duolingo, Shift4Payments, and AppLovin are all top growth stocks because they have stellar growth rates, strong growth outlooks, and net profits. Those traits are rare. But that doesn't necessarily mean that all are timely opportunities right now -- some are downright expensive.\n\nIf I had to choose one of these four, I'd choose Shift4Payments for this reason. The company trades at a cheap valuation because it's easily overlooked. But its growth speaks for itself, and it's doing it profitably, whereas so many other fintech companies are burning cash. Therefore, Shift4Payments stock is one to consider buying today.\n\nJon Quast has positions in Block. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Block, CrowdStrike, Duolingo, and Toast.

        "title": "Is CrowdStrike Stock a Buy Right Now?",
        "content": "CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) outspoken Co-Founder and CEO George Kurtz went on the offensive during the last quarterly conference call and the market reacted well to what he had to say. As a result, shares of the leading endpoint-cybersecurity software provider have held on to most of their 200%-plus gain since the start of 2023.\n\nKurtz threw some subtle shade at numerous cybersecurity peers on the last earnings update, even name-dropping Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) as CrowdStrike's unified platform is attempting to gobble up market share of a fiercely competitive security-software market. (For the record, Palo Alto's CEO, as well as Zscaler's (NASDAQ: ZS) and Cloudflare's respective co-founders and CEOs, also tend to talk a lot about their peers' failings on quarterly calls with investors.)\n\nPeeling away all of cybersecurity leaders' chutzpah reveals solid reasons investors should still be paying attention to CrowdStrike and might even consider buying shares even as it trades near all-time highs.\n\nA market ripe for consolidation\n\nAll of the cybersecurity pure-play leaders (which exclude big, diversified tech companies, including the Magnificent Seven, all of which have various types of cybersecurity offerings) have been talking a lot about \"platforming\" in the industry. What's that?\n\nAfter years of fast-evolving, enterprise security needs, accelerated by the advent of cloud computing and the pandemic, organizations have a multitude of cybersecurity vendors to choose from. But the leaders -- CrowdStrike in endpoint security for things like laptops and other mobile devices, Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT) in older network security, and Zscaler in cloud-based network security -- are looking to expand their offerings and provide their customers with more of an all-in-one package. Not only would fewer vendors simplify a security team's life, but consolidation can also lead to better outcomes.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike in particular thinks this latter point works in its favor. Kurtz and company often talk up CrowdStrike's single platform that covers multiple needs in software security. That can make keeping tabs on security a cinch, rather than having to manage multiple modules and dashboards with disparate data (see chart below). Chart source: CrowdStrike.\n\nAll of this talk about displacing smaller players to consolidate the complicated cybersecurity field has some truth to it. The biggest four players have been growing their sales at a faster-than-industry-average pace for some time, which, overall, has been outstanding at a low-teens percentage rate of growth. CrowdStrike has been a particular standout over the last five years, as it just achieved its first year with sales exceeding $3 billion. CRWD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nCrowdStrike's enduring advantage in the security software race?\n\nCrowdStrike, in spite of all its spectacular growth, hasn't appealed to a broad group of investors since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019. That's because up until the second half of fiscal 2024 (the 12-month period ended in January 2024), CrowdStrike operated at a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) loss. Of course, the company always showed promise of eventually achieving GAAP profitability. Its free cash flow (FCF) has been positive and rising for a long time.\n\nHowever many investors who favor a \"value\" have called out high amounts of employee stock-based compensation (which is excluded in the FCF calculation) as a sore spot. There's good reason to worry about stock-based compensation, as it can excessively dilute existing shareholders. However, CrowdStrike has now successfully scaled its business to profitability on all counts, which could please a new group of would-be owners of the stock. And on a per-share basis (which accounts for a growing share count), the argument that stock-based compensation is diluting shareholders hasn't held much weight. CRWD EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart\n\nMore importantly than CrowdStrike's fist-pumping about its software technology, profit metrics like this help confirm that a company also has the right business model to succeed over the long term. To be clear, CrowdStrike still has lots of progress to make on this front. But as it extends its cybersecurity platform, the profit margins should continue to tick higher.\n\nThis is no cheap stock, so not all value investors will want to bite. CrowdStrike currently trades for over 80 times this year's expected GAAP earnings per share and over 60 times next year's early expectation for earnings. Nevertheless, with the company expecting to grow its revenue by another 30% in calendar year 2024, there's a lot to like about CrowdStrike if you plan to buy and hold for the long term. I recently nibbled a bit more of this stock, and it will remain on my watch list.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The S&P 500 index bottomed in October 2022 following a 10-month slide that culminated in a technical bear market. It took the index more than a year to climb back to a new all-time high, which happened in January 2024. It was the final hurdle the S&P 500 had to clear before investors could formally recognize the new bull market.\n\nA number of high-quality stocks are now hovering near all-time highs, but that doesn't mean it's too late to buy. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) is one of them. It's a leading provider of cybersecurity products powered by artificial intelligence (AI), and its stock is soaring on the back of the company's impressive financial results.\n\nHere's why it's not too late for investors to buy CrowdStrike stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCyberattacks are growing in frequency because of AI\n\nAdvanced tools like generative AI are being weaponized by malicious actors to rapidly create realistic content designed to fool employees in large organizations into handing over sensitive information. For example, Palo Alto Networks says phishing emails increased tenfold in the last 12 months alone, solely because of AI.\n\nEmployees are the most vulnerable part of any company because of their constant interactions with the outside world through email, phone, and messaging platforms. CrowdStrike says 90% of successful cyberattacks originate at the endpoint -- meaning the computer or device those workers are using to complete their day-to-day activities.\n\nAutomated cyber protection is key because it's unrealistic to expect every employee to become a security expert, and that's why CrowdStrike's AI approach is so powerful. Its models are trained on mountains of data, including 2 trillion security events every day. CrowdStrike also makes over 180 million indicator-of-attack decisions every second to determine the intent of malicious actors. Processing that much volume simply wouldn't be possible without AI.\n\nCrowdStrike's flagship Falcon platform isn't just an endpoint product. It includes cloud security, identity security, and exposure management (among other modules), to give businesses a holistic solution. That allows them to consolidate their cybersecurity spending to one provider, and as of the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 31), the majority of CrowdStrike customers (64%) were using at least five Falcon modules.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike also said the number of customers using eight modules more than doubled from a year ago, which really highlights how business's needs are broadening.\n\nCrowdStrike continues to grow quickly, but also profitably\n\nCrowdStrike generated a record $3 billion in revenue during fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31), representing a 36% increase from fiscal 2023. The company could grow by more than 30% in fiscal 2025, too, with almost $4 billion in revenue expected at the high end of management's guidance.\n\nHowever, CrowdStrike's profitability might be the bigger story. The company delivered $89.3 million in net income during fiscal 2024, and while that sounds like a modest number on billions of dollars in revenue, it was a positive swing from the $183.2 million net loss it generated in the prior year.\n\nOn a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis, CrowdStrike's net income soared 104% year over year to $751.7 million. That number strips out one-off and noncash expenses like stock-based compensation to give investors a better idea of how profitable CrowdStrike's actual business operations are.\n\nProfitability is a point of focus for investors right now because the challenging economic environment is revealing that most technology companies are great at growing quickly, but very few of them successfully maintain strong growth when they moderate their expenditures to deliver a profit.\n\nWhy it's not too late to buy CrowdStrike stock now\n\nCrowdStrike stock rose more than 400% over the last five years and it's trading near an all-time high, but the company's long-term financial forecast suggests it's not too late to buy into this growth story.\n\nIt ended fiscal 2024 with $3.4 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR), which differs from actual revenue because it measures the expected future value of existing subscriptions. However, management wants to scale that number to $10 billion within the next five to seven years.\n\nBut even if CrowdStrike achieves that ARR target, it would still only represent a fraction of the company's estimated $225 billion total addressable market for fiscal 2028.\n\nCrowdStrike currently has a market cap of $80 billion, which places its stock at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 26.2 based on its fiscal 2024 revenue. That is quite expensive compared to other cybersecurity giants; Palo Alto Networks stock trades at a P/S ratio of 13.8, for example.\n\nBut the stock market is a forward-looking machine. If management's forecasts prove accurate over the next seven years, CrowdStrike stock might actually be a bargain at today's price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

If you want to skip our overview of cybersecurity stocks and the industry, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Most Undervalued Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy According To Analysts.\n\nWhile most attention this year has focused on artificial intelligence, space exploration, or weight loss drugs, quietly in the background, one sector has reminded everyone once again that it is just as important as any other industry. This sector is none other than cybersecurity, and as we settle into 2024, a war of sorts has broken out in the digital world.\n\nIf you've been unfortunate enough to have dealt with the healthcare system over the past month, then it's possible that you faced a disruption on the insurance front. If so, then this was because the systems of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)'s business division Change Healthcare were hacked, which led to a suspension of insurance claims processing at pharmacies across several areas. Immediately after the attack, reports surfaced that the ransomware group BlackHat might be responsible, as it had vowed to target healthcare facilities after the U.S. Justice Department had shared in December 2023 that it had conducted a massive operation against the group to seize its digital assets and other tools. It later turned out that the suspicions were correct, with UnitedHealth's vice president confirming the fact in a statement given to TechCrunch.\n\nSince the hack led to pharmacies and hospitals being unable to process payments, it resulted in a cash shortage as healthcare providers were unable to make their payments on time but had to provide services to patients and customers at the same time. However, despite its scale, the ransomware attack isn't the only cybersecurity threat that has been in the news lately. One of the biggest technology stocks and companies in the world, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) joined the choir in March 2024 when it shared that a Russian hacker gang's data breach in January that led to the leaking of data of Microsoft employees was being used for another cyberattack. While the Russian embassy in the U.S. does not respond to Microsoft's allegations, the firm is quite persistent with them, and the latest attack led cybersecurity professionals to worry that perhaps the hackers were trying to embed backdoors in Microsoft's software products.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at these striking developments, one would wonder that perhaps investing in cybersecurity stocks is a sound decision. After all, the copious amounts of data generated and stored every day create incentives for nefarious actors to try their hand at quick riches, and in the process, it also generates demand for cybersecurity products. Companies that provide cybersecurity services, such as Gen Digital Inc. (NASDAQ:GEN) are typically classified as cybersecurity stocks, but due to the polar nature of the technology industry where giants like Microsoft dominate several industries, other firms such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are also key players in the industry. For those out of the loop, Alphabet's cybersecurity division Mandiant was at the center of efforts to determine the roots of UnitedHealth's ransomware attack, after Google bought the firm for a cool $5.4 billion in 2022.\n\nSo, as the thinking goes, since there are more cybersecurity threats, cybersecurity stocks are great to invest in as more global organizations look towards them to secure infrastructure and data worth billions of dollars. To check whether this hypothesis holds water, let's take a look at the performance of the S&P Kensho Cyber Security Index. The group of stocks that seek to provide digital security services to businesses is up by a respectable 35% over the past twelve months, a time period that has not only seen law enforcement fend off ransomware gangs but also a complicated global political landscape in which Chinese hackers like the uniquely named \"Volt Typhoon\" roam free. Year to date, the stock index's price appreciation dimmed down to 4.5%, as technology stocks experienced a broader lift on the back of investor hopes of interest rate cuts in 2024 despite inflation being higher than what the Federal Reserve's public statements would prefer.\n\nIn a world beset with physical and digital threats, it's also important to see what the smart money thinks when it comes to cybersecurity stocks. On this front, here is what Artisan Partners' fourth quarter of 2023 investor letter had to say about the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD):\n\nTop-performing securities CrowdStrike Holdings, a security software provider, reported strong earnings results \u2013 driven by strength in cloud security and identity protection \u2013 with a better than expected profitability profile. Cyber threats remain elevated, and it is likely that the rise of artificial intelligence will make it easier for criminals to generate and scale more sophisticated attacks, which could increase the demand for CrowdStrike products in the years ahead.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the most undervalued cybersecurity stocks according to analysts. A couple of names are Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS), Telos Corporation (NASDAQ:TLS), and Arqit Quantum Inc. (NASDAQ:ARQQ). 11 Most Undervalued Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\nPhoto by Obie Fernandez on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most undervalued cybersecurity stocks to buy according to analysts, we ranked the U.S. traded holdings of the Global X Cybersecurity ETF\u00a0 by their average analyst share price target percentage upside and picked out the top stocks.\n\nFor these undervalued cybersecurity stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "title": "Why SentinelOne (S) Shares Are Plunging Today",
        "content": "Why SentinelOne (S) Shares Are Plunging Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cyber security company SentinelOne (NYSE:S) fell 16.7% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results and provided revenue guidance for the upcoming year, which came in below expectations, suggesting a slowdown in demand amidst an intense competitive landscape with cybersecurity peers like CrowdStrike. In addition, its net revenue retention rate of 115% missed estimates of 118%. That means its existing customers bought fewer products, and the company is more dependent on new customers (expensive to acquire) to generate growth. Guidance was also underwhelming, with the revenue projections for the next quarter and full year roughly in line with expectations. Overall, this was a tough quarter for SentinelOne.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy SentinelOne? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nSentinelOne's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 28 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for SentinelOne and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 8 days ago, when the company gained 10.8% on the news that peer, CrowdStrike reported fourth-quarter results with revenue and ARR (annual recurring revenue) beating by a slight margin but very convincingly on operating profit. Keeping with that theme, while forward guidance for the next quarter and the full year were only slightly above expectations, non-GAAP EPS guidance was more convincingly ahead, showing better-than-expected profitability.\n\nLastly, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) warned of weakness in security spending a few weeks ago when it reported earnings, sending waves of caution across the sector. Cybersecurity peers that reported after Palo Alto put up mixed results, which kept investors on edge for CrowdStrike's results.\n\nSentinelOne is down 9.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $23.37 per share it is trading 22.1% below its 52-week high of $30 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of SentinelOne's shares at the IPO in June 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $549.60.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks to Sell in March Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "If you want to know which growth stocks to sell this month, you\u2019re in the right place. Growth stocks have had a tremendous start to 2024. Between artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors, quantum computing and other cutting-edge breakthroughs, this is a promising time for the sector.\n\nEven with all these promising developments, however, that isn\u2019t a green light for all growth stocks. In fact, much of the rally in growth stocks was premised on the idea that the Federal Reserve would start cutting interest rates meaningfully in 2024. Instead, the economy remains strong and inflation hasn\u2019t declined as much as anticipated.\n\nBetween high valuations and the potential for the Fed walking back prior support to the market, the growth space could be set for a major correction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, not all growth stocks are created equal. In fact, some are quite risky here following their tremendous rallies over the past year. These are seven growth stocks to sell that look especially risky for March 2024 and beyond.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Sell: Crowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is the epitome of a good company selling at a ridiculous price. While Crowdstrike has a promising business with favorable growth prospects, the market has gotten far too optimistic, setting up inevitable disappointment later this year.\n\nMany software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies traded up to incredibly high price-to-sales ratios in 2021 and then saw their share prices collapse in 2022 as financial gravity kicked in. You might think that investors would learn their lesson from the collapse of these formerly high-flying software firms.\n\nAnd yet, Crowdstrike has recovered all of its 2022 losses. In fact, with a more than 150% rally over the past 12 months, CRWD stock has now reached new all-time highs. This time around, traders are pointing to potential AI benefits in the cybersecurity space. That could well be the case, but it will be a competitive race to deploy AI in cybersecurity and it\u2019s far from assured that Crowdstrike will be the ultimate winner.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut with CRWD stock at more than 80 times forward earnings and at nearly 20 times forward revenues, Crowdstrike is priced for perfection. Any slowdown in revenues or disappointment on the AI front could lead the share price to crash.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn paper, it seems like Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) should be a tremendous business. The company is a classic marketplace with tremendous network effects, and it gets to grab a piece of millions of transactions across mobility, food delivery, and other such services.\n\nIn addition, Uber has had a massive opportunity to build brand awareness and loyalty in recent years. The pandemic caused a huge disruption to shopping and dining out, giving Uber the chance to impress customers with efficient food and grocery delivery.\n\nAnd while Uber has grown its business and seen revenues surge, it has still struggled to convert that into consistent profitability. UBER stock is going for a lofty 65 times forward earnings right now.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Uber will be able to push profitability that much farther from here, either. The company is increasingly facing regulatory pushback as consumers and restaurant owners complain about high fees and drivers claim that they are underpaid. All this suggests that Uber will struggle to raise its margins from here which in turn would imply that shares are dramatically overvalued.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Sell: Dell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany investors probably remember Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) as a company that makes personal computers. And Dell still has a large consumer electronics business to be certain.\n\nHowever, it merged with EMC in 2016, and in doing so, it became a leader in storage, information security, and consulting functions as well. DELL stock has hummed along, largely under the radar, for many years due to its largely unglamorous collection of business operations.\n\nThat has changed recently, however, with DELL stock rising an incredible 199% over the past 12 months.\n\nIn particular, DELL stock has soared more than 35% over the past month. This came following an earnings report where Dell highlighted rapid growth in its AI server sales. Despite this, however, Dell\u2019s overall revenues actually declined 11% year-over-year for the quarter.\n\nAt this price, investors are pricing in way too much optimism based on Dell\u2019s AI functions, even as the overall business is not showing much favorable momentum. Morningstar\u2019s William Kerwin agrees; he believes DELL shares are worth just $55 each, implying that the stock has more than 50% downside from here once the AI server hype fades.\n\nSoundhound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Dell, I believe Soundhound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) has rallied more due to general enthusiasm around artificial intelligence than any specific strengths at this particular company.\n\nSoundhound AI is a small unprofitable firm that aims to develop and commercialize voice, sound, and natural language artificial intelligence technologies.\n\nSOUN stock quadrupled in February. This came due to news that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) had taken a position in Soundhound AI. Sounds great, right? However, Nvidia invests in a variety of smaller companies, and these bets can be quite small. Reportedly, Nvidia invested a modest $3.7 million in SOUN stock, which is better than nothing but not necessarily a massive vote of confidence either.\n\nSOUN stock has cooled off a bit recently following a disappointing earnings report. While revenues grew sharply, the company reported a wider-than-expected operating loss and hasn\u2019t even reached breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA basis yet. Shares seem wildly overvalued at their current $1.8 billion market capitalization given that analysts foresee just $70 million in revenues for 2024.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Sell: Celsius Holdings (CELH) A view of several cans of Celsius (CELH) energy drinks, on display at a local grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnergy drink marker Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) has given its investors a jolt. CELH stock is up 200% over the past year, and a stunning 7,000% over the past five years.\n\nNeedless to say, early investors in Celsius have enjoyed blockbuster returns. But at some point, the risk/reward ratio turns against shareholders. We are at that point today following Celsius stock\u2019s 56% year-to-date rally.\n\nIncredibly, Celsius has posted these incredible gains even as the company\u2019s latest quarterly report saw its earnings per share fall short of expectations. Yes, revenues are still soaring, but the firm appears to be giving up ground on pricing to drive its revenue growth, leading to slipping profit margins.\n\nIn the bigger picture, Celsius had a tremendous run when it was a small company. But it is now a more mature business with fewer growth opportunities that faces robust competition. This will make it exceedingly difficult for CELH stock to maintain its current 80 times forward P/E ratio.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY) is a leading pharmaceutical company that offers treatments for a wide variety of ailments.\n\nThe firm has enjoyed incredible performance over the past year thanks to its GLP-1 drugs, including Mounjaro, which have become blockbuster products for helping with weight loss and diabetes management.\n\nThese drugs are helping lots of people, and the company\u2019s sales are likely to continue to grow in the coming years. However, the valuation has seemingly gotten way out of hand, with LLY stock up more than 125% over the past year. Eli Lilly now has a market capitalization of almost $700 billion and sells for a stunning 60 times forward earnings.\n\nAnalysts project that Lilly will bring in about $41 billion in annual revenues this year, and topline growth is around 20%. That\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s not nearly enough to support a $700 billion market cap given the short patent lives of pharmaceutical drugs before they give way to generic competition.\n\nEli Lilly is enjoying a windfall right now, but the party is going to end a lot sooner than LLY stockholders realize.\n\nCava (CAVA) Horizontal, medium closeup of \"CAVA\" outdoor free standing brand and logo signage on a bright sunny day against a clear blue sky.\n\nSource: Bruce VanLoon / Shutterstock.com\n\nCava (NYSE:CAVA) is a fast-casual Mediterranean restaurant chain. The company completed its IPO in 2023 and the stock has now doubled since last fall.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see why there is so much enthusiasm, though. The bull case is that Cava can be the Chipotle of Greek food. In a vacuum, that may sound like an enticing pitch. But many fast casual chains have tried to become the Chipotle of some specific cuisine and the vast majority invariably fizzle out.\n\nThe fast casual dining market is far more competitive than it used to be. And inflation and economic strain are putting pressure on consumers. This adds up to a scary outlook for CAVA stock given that it is trading at a jaw-dropping 200 times forward earnings and 10 times revenues today. Those sorts of multiples are hard for restaurants to maintain even if their business execution is perfect.\n\nMy guess is that Cava will be more like the next\u00a0Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK). Shake Shack, you may recall, went public back in 2015 and became a momentum stock for a time with traders bidding it up fourfold following the IPO.\n\nSince then, SHAK shares have underperformed despite a dramatic amount of growth in its underlying business. Given Cava\u2019s similarly sky-high multiples, it will take many years for the company\u2019s growth to catch up with today\u2019s stock price, if it ever does at all.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Industry-first offering empowers Boards of Directors and C-suite executives to navigate SEC breach disclosure regulations by assessing technical risk, testing materiality decisions and informing annual disclosures\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, March 14, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) today unveiled CrowdStrike SEC Readiness Services, providing public companies the technology and expertise required to mitigate risk and comply with the new SEC breach disclosure rules. Powered by the AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae XDR platform and the industry-leading CrowdStrike Services team, Boards of Directors and C-suite executives can gain the strategic insights needed to harden the organization against breaches, make materiality decisions and issue annual cyber disclosures with confidence.\n\nThe new SEC regulations require public companies to disclose the processes for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats in their annual 10-K filing, and to report on material cyber incidents within four days of determining an incident is material. These new regulations increase pressure on public companies and their boards, as determining the materiality of a breach can be difficult, and failure to comply with the requirements could result in litigation or financial penalties. CrowdStrike\u2019s comprehensive SEC Readiness Services assist Boards of Directors and C-suite executives in addressing critical questions, assessing organizational risk, understanding what might constitute a material incident and having confidence that annual cyber disclosures are accurate.\n\n\"The new SEC rules substantiate the gravity of today\u2019s cybersecurity threats and have changed the way company boards should view cyber risk. In the face of unprecedented pressure on boards and executives to prioritize cybersecurity, it is critical they have a partner like CrowdStrike in the foxhole with them,\" said George Kurtz, co-founder and CEO of CrowdStrike. \"Our expertise from responding to some of the world's most damaging cyber incidents, unparalleled understanding of the threat landscape and industry-leading technology provide the edge public companies need to meet disclosure requirements and harden their environments to stop breaches.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s new SEC Readiness Services help organizations navigate SEC cyber regulations through:\n\nDetailed Risk Management Reviews: CrowdStrike boosts organizational confidence in risk disclosures with a two-pronged approach consisting of a technical assessment and program review. Leveraging the power of the Falcon platform, organizations gain a detailed technical assessment of their current security posture. By identifying gaps that could lead to an incident, organizations can align security policies and practices to harden their cyber defenses and stop breaches. In addition, CrowdStrike experts provide a programmatic review of the organization\u2019s risk management practices, ensuring that the people, processes and governance structures align with the business. C-suite executives and Boards of Directors gain deep visibility and oversight of the organization\u2019s risk posture to support public filings. Materiality Tabletop Exercises: CrowdStrike experts design exercises that enable public companies to test their processes for determining if a security incident is material and requires filing an 8-K with the SEC. CrowdStrike tailors real-world scenarios to each organization, allowing them to ensure they have the right people at the table, considering the right information, with the appropriate guidance necessary to know if a public disclosure should take place.\n\nFor more information on CrowdStrike\u2019s new SEC Readiness Services, please read our blog.\n\nAbout CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD), a global cybersecurity leader, has redefined modern security with the world\u2019s most advanced cloud-native platform for protecting critical areas of enterprise risk \u2013 endpoints and cloud workloads, identity and data.\n\nPowered by the CrowdStrike Security Cloud and world-class AI, the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae platform leverages real-time indicators of attack, threat intelligence, evolving adversary tradecraft and enriched telemetry from across the enterprise to deliver hyper-accurate detections, automated protection and remediation, elite threat hunting and prioritized observability of vulnerabilities.\n\nPurpose-built in the cloud with a single lightweight-agent architecture, the Falcon platform delivers rapid and scalable deployment, superior protection and performance, reduced complexity and immediate time-to-value.\n\nCrowdStrike: We stop breaches.\n\nLearn more: https://www.crowdstrike.com/ \r\nFollow us: Blog | Twitter | LinkedIn | Facebook | Instagram \r\nStart a free trial today: https://www.crowdstrike.com/free-trial-guide/\n\n\u00a9 2024 CrowdStrike, Inc.

        "title": "7 Cybersecurity Stocks That Meta Should Consider Buying",
        "content": "41 state attorneys general have penned a letter to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) expressing concerns over the increasing number of complaints about hacked Facebook and Instagram accounts, as Wired reported last week. There could be a solution to this. One of them is for Meta to scour the landscape of cybersecurity stocks and select some for acquisition targets.\n\nSome of the illicit activities the platform faces include charging large sums to stored credit cards or running unauthorized advertisements. As cybercrime rises worldwide, the prevalence of scams on sites like Facebook has seemingly gotten worse and more brazen. The letter reported a significant increase in complaints between 2019 and 2023, with victims being left in the dark and reportedly tying up the resources of law enforcement officials dealing with the aftermath.\n\nSo, in this article, I\u2019ve proposed seven cybersecurity stocks that Meta could acquire to help protect its web properties and potentially restore some lost trust by users who hackers and cyber criminals have burned in the past.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCybersecurity Stocks: Fortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is one of those cybersecurity stocks that Meta could potentially acquire. Although FTNT\u2019s market cap of around 54 billion at the time of writing is arguably pricey, the company\u2019s outlook over the short term looks attractive.\r\n\r\nFTNT stock is expected to grow by approximately 10% CAGR in 2024. The company has projected revenue for the first quarter of 2024 in the range of $1.30 billion to $1.36 billion. Billings are in the range of $1.39 billion to $1.45 billion.\n\nThe company is expecting a shift in the cybersecurity industry which is central to its strategy. Fortinet, citing Gartner, notes that 97% of organizations have plans for vendor consolidation, highlighting the industry\u2019s shift towards fewer, more dominant players in the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, FTNT\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) is expected to grow 19.57% this year, which could mean that the company will soon be valued higher.\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nZscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) could be an attractive pick for a Meta acquisition, as it currently serves over 40% of Fortune 500 companies, which could open the door for Meta to cross-sell some of its complementary enterprise services.\n\nZS stock\u2019s price tag is slightly lower, with a market cap of just 29 billion. But like with the other cybersecurity stocks on this list, the company\u2019s outlook and recent financial performance have been impressive.\r\n\r\nFor Q2 2024, Zscaler expects EPS in the range of 57 cents to 58 cents and revenue between $505 million and $507 million. The full fiscal year 2024 projections include an EPS of $2.45 to $2.48, revenue of $2.09 billion to $2.1 billion, and operating income between $360 million and $365 million.\n\nAnother draw card for ZS in terms of acquisition by Meta is its Zero Trust Exchange platform, which connects users directly to apps and eliminates traditional security vulnerabilities. This could be key to preventing the mass of account takeovers for Meta if successfully integrated.\n\nCybersecurity Stocks: CrowdStrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is known for safeguarding critical cloud workloads and could prove to be an accretive acquisition for Meta; both in terms of its potential synergy with its core business as well as a potentially lucrative diversifier.\n\nCRWD recently reported a significant beat on both the top and bottom lines, with earnings per share of 95 cents adjusted compared to an expected 82 cents, and revenue of $845 million versus an expected $839 million. Full-year revenue increased by 36% year-over-year (YOY), reaching $3 billion.\n\nLooking ahead, it has expected revenues between $902 million and $906 million for the next quarter surpassing the consensus estimate. Similarly, earnings per share for the period are expected to be between 89 cents and 90 cents, also exceeding the consensus estimate. It is also committed to achieving $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by 2030.\n\nWith a market cap of 77 billion, CRWD is one of the more expensive companies on this list, but an acquisition by META could be highly accretive. Its EPS should swell to 7.11 before FY2028, up from 2.81 at the time of writing. With its specialty in safeguarding the cloud and significant commercial relationships, it could pan out to be a strong investment.\n\nVaronis Systems (VRNS) A concept image of a person holding a phone with various icons representing software-as-a-service companies.\n\nSource: TierneyMJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nVaronis Systems (NASDAQ:VRNS) is one of those small-cap cybersecurity stocks with a market cap of just 5.4 billion. Its valuation alone could be a substantial deciding factor in making it an acquisition target for META. Its specialization in Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) takes the cake, though. DPSM allows organizations to see where their sensitive data is and who has access to it. These are two things that META could leverage to help secure its user accounts.\n\nMeanwhile, VRNS is undergoing a SaaS transition, aiming to complete it by 2026, a year earlier than previously anticipated. Once complete, the transition should comprise 70% to 90% of the company\u2019s total ARR.\r\n\r\nVaronis also finished FY2023 with an ARR of $543 million, a 17% YOY increase. It saw a substantial boost in free cash flow to $54.3 million in 2023 from $0.5 million the previous year.\n\nSaaS companies, in general, can be lucrative acquisition targets. This is especially true for companies that already heavily rely on SaaS, such as META. META\u2019s existing book of business could also synergize well with its offerings.\n\nCybersecurity Stocks: CyberArk (CYBR) CyberArk stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) specializes in privileged access management. This is a crucial step towards mitigating illegal account takeovers for META users.\n\nThe company expects its total revenue for the full year to range between $920 million and $930 million. This surpasses the consensus estimate of $915.82 million. For the first quarter of 2024, revenue is forecasted to be between $209 million and $215 million, again beating the consensus estimate of $207.25 million\u200b.\n\nA great thing about CYBR is its market cap, standing at $11 billion, and analysts are also bullish on the company\u2019s long-term prospects.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s a slight predicted decrease for its stock price within the next twelve months, its EPS is predicted to skyrocket 89.45% next year, which would put it firmly in profitability at 1.79.\n\nBuying small-growing companies while they are still cheap to scoop up can be a viable strategy. Furthermore, its privileged access management software could potentially plug some holes in META\u2019s stock stack. Thus, CYBR is one of those cybersecurity stocks for the company to consider acquiring.\n\nCheck Point (CHKP) Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy: Check Point Software (CHKP)\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nCheck Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) is a key player in the cybersecurity space, emphasizing comprehensive protection for its clients. This is despite its slightly lower valuation relative to some of its peers at 18 billion at the time of writing.\n\nIn its most recent earnings for Q4 2023, CHKP surpassed analyst expectations with an EPS of $2.57, which was 10 cents higher than the consensus estimate of $2.47. The company\u2019s revenue for the quarter stood at $663.50 million, slightly above the forecast of $662.09 million.\n\nThe reason I like CHKP is that its offerings could synergize well with the needs of META. Namely, it offers a comprehensive suite of services, which the market is steadily heaving towards as a long-term trend. This then positions it well for the future.\n\nMeanwhile, the company gave an EPS range for 2024 that will be between $8.70 and $9.30, against a consensus estimate of $9.05. Revenue expectations are set between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, aligning with the consensus revenue estimate of $2.5 billion.\n\nOkta (OKTA) Okta, Inc. Logo seen on billboard. Okta (formerly Saasure Inc.) is an American identity and access management company based in San Francisco\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nOkta (NASDAQ:OKTA) is the last of those cybersecurity stocks among potential good fits for a Meta acquisition. The company\u2019s valuation dipped into the $80 range this year but has since rebounded.\n\nThe key reason I believe that OKTA could be a good target is that in addition to providing robust cloud security services, the company is also undervalued relative to its long-term growth potential, which could be accretive for the acquiring business.\n\nMeanwhile, OKTA\u2019s outlook seems robust. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company is projecting EPS to be between 54 cents and 55 cents. Revenue expectations range from $603 million to $605 million. This guidance surpasses the consensus revenue estimate of $584.9 million.\n\nAlso, at an $18 billion market cap, the firm\u2019s assets and future free cash flows could be cheap for META to acquire. Additionally, it provides further opportunities to grow its earnings via offering additional enterprise services to its customer base.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "1 Little-Known Cybersecurity Stock Investors Should Be Watching for 2024",
        "content": "Cybersecurity heavyweights are locked in a war of words. During a recent round of conference calls, and later in follow-ups on Twitter/X, CEOs from Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) and CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) both took shots at competitors, including each other. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz even name-dropped Palo Alto in his prepared remarks, even though the two juggernauts don't directly compete in their core businesses of network security (Palo Alto) and endpoint security (CrowdStrike).\n\nMeanwhile, smaller players are delivering solid, profitable growth in the background. One of those cybersecurity providers is Qualys (NASDAQ: QLYS), which just reported another round of consistent financial results. The stock has doubled in the last five years, even after a recent sell-off. Here's what investors should know about Qualys for 2024 and beyond.\n\nA compelling cybersecurity stock\n\nQualys offers a cloud-based set of software tools that help organizations with security compliance. It scans for security vulnerabilities and suggests fixes to weaknesses it finds. As IT infrastructure has gotten more complicated with a mix of legacy internal networks and public cloud, the number of devices and apps large businesses need to track and keep secure has ballooned. The Qualys platform can play an integral role in a company's cybersecurity efforts.\n\nQualys isn't the fastest-growing cyber specialist in the industry, averaging a low- to mid-teens percentage revenue growth rate since 2020. It's a small player with revenue of just $555 million in 2023 (compared to billions in annual sales at the largest cybersecurity pure plays). And where many security software platform providers struggle with profitability, Qualys actually offers investors a compelling proposition with robust GAAP net income and free cash flow (FCF) generation despite its size. FCF profit margin was an impressive 42.5% last year, one of the best rates of cash generation among its peer group.\n\nStory continues QLYS Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nQualys has been plowing big chunks of this FCF into share repurchases, returning $171 million and $317 million to shareholders in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The balance sheet is also rock solid with $426 million in cash and short-term investments and zero debt.\n\nQualys expects to grow revenue 8% to 10% in 2024, according to management's current outlook. Again, no growth records to be found here, but paired with its profitability and healthy balance sheet, there could be a lot to like about Qualys for the right investor.\n\nIs competition going to crush Qualys?\n\nAs a high-profit business, Qualys stock is a rare value play in the high growth but usually high premium cybersecurity market. Shares of Qualys currently trade for 42 times trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS) and 27 times trailing-12-month FCF.\n\nHowever, some of the jockeying between Palo Alto and CrowdStrike could actually hurt small companies like Qualys the most. The two cybersecurity giants are expanding into ancillary areas. That includes compliance and data security posture management (DSPM), the very niche Qualys and other small peers like Tenable operate in.\n\nBoth Palo Alto and CrowdStrike made DSPM acquisitions in recent months (Palo Alto purchased Dig and Flow Security just announced it will be joining CrowdStrike) to grow their own platforms and expand their security software market share.\n\nQualys is definitely worth watching this year. The company is still putting up respectable numbers, and it clearly offers a valuable service that many organizations need right now. But with competition mounting, shares still look a bit pricey to me at the moment -- even if it's a relative value compared to larger peers. I'm nevertheless interested enough to keep tabs on this small business as 2024 progresses and the cybersecurity wars heat up.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Qualys right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Qualys, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Qualys wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. Just Beat EPS By 38%: Here's What Analysts Think Will Happen Next",
        "content": "Investors in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) had a good week, as its shares rose 4.8% to close at US$330 following the release of its yearly results. It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$3.1b were what the analysts expected, CrowdStrike Holdings surprised by delivering a (statutory) profit of US$0.37 per share, an impressive 38% above what was forecast. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\n\nSee our latest analysis for CrowdStrike Holdings  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nAfter the latest results, the 45 analysts covering CrowdStrike Holdings are now predicting revenues of US$3.97b in 2025. If met, this would reflect a huge 30% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 126% to US$0.84. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$3.95b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.75 in 2025. There was no real change to the revenue estimates, but the analysts do seem more bullish on earnings, given the nice increase in earnings per share expectations following these results.\n\nThe consensus price target rose 20% to US$384, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values CrowdStrike Holdings at US$540 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$196. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that CrowdStrike Holdings' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 30% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 43% p.a. growth over the last five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 12% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while CrowdStrike Holdings' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards CrowdStrike Holdings following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\n\nKeeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for CrowdStrike Holdings going out to 2027, and you can see them free on our platform here..\n\nIt is also worth noting that we have found 2 warning signs for CrowdStrike Holdings that you need to take into consideration.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Decoding CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (CRWD): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "Revenue growth of 36% year-over-year, reaching $3.1 billion in fiscal 2024. Net income turnaround to $89.3 million in fiscal 2024 from losses in previous years. Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) increased by 34% to $3.4 billion as of January 31, 2024. Strategic acquisition of Bionic to bolster Application Security Posture Management.\n\nOn March 7, 2024, CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) filed its 10-K report, revealing a robust financial performance for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. The cloud-based cybersecurity leader reported a significant revenue increase to $3.1 billion, up 36% from the previous fiscal year, and a remarkable shift to net income of $89.3 million, a substantial improvement from the net losses reported in fiscal 2023 and 2022. With a growing Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of $3.4 billion, CrowdStrike's financial tables reflect a company on the rise, leveraging its innovative Falcon platform to expand its market presence. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in CrowdStrike's latest SEC filing, providing investors with a comprehensive view of the company's strategic position.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with CRWD. Decoding CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (CRWD): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nRobust Revenue Growth and Market Position: CrowdStrike's impressive revenue growth, driven by a 36% increase in subscription revenue, underscores its strong market position and the efficacy of its cloud-native Falcon platform. The company's ability to pivot to profitability, with a net income of $89.3 million in fiscal 2024, reflects its operational efficiency and growing market acceptance. CrowdStrike's ARR surge to $3.4 billion signifies a solid customer base and recurring revenue stream, which are indicative of the company's competitive edge and the high demand for its cybersecurity solutions.\n\nInnovative Technology and Product Development: CrowdStrike's commitment to innovation is evident in its cloud-native architecture and AI-driven Falcon platform, which has positioned the company as a leader in endpoint protection, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response. The company's significant investments in research and development, including the strategic acquisition of Bionic, demonstrate its focus on maintaining technological leadership and expanding its product offerings in the rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape.\n\nStory continues\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on Subscription Model: While CrowdStrike's subscription-based revenue model provides a predictable and stable revenue stream, it also exposes the company to customer retention risks. Any significant churn in its customer base could impact the company's financial performance. Moreover, the reliance on renewals necessitates continuous innovation and customer satisfaction to maintain and grow its subscription revenue.\n\nOperational Costs and Competition: Despite achieving profitability, CrowdStrike faces high operational costs, particularly in sales and marketing, which accounted for 37% of its total revenue. The competitive nature of the cybersecurity market requires substantial investment in customer acquisition and retention, which could pressure margins if not managed effectively. Additionally, the company operates in a highly competitive environment, with the need to constantly innovate to stay ahead of both established and emerging competitors.\n\nOpportunities\n\nMarket Expansion and International Growth: CrowdStrike's international revenue grew by 43% in fiscal 2024, indicating significant potential for further global expansion. The company's plans to increase investments in overseas operations and data centers present an opportunity to capture a larger share of the international market, particularly in regions with growing cybersecurity needs.\n\nStrategic Acquisitions and Partnerships: The acquisition of Bionic enhances CrowdStrike's Application Security Posture Management capabilities, offering new avenues for growth. The company's open ecosystem approach, including the CrowdStrike Store, enables strategic partnerships that can extend its market reach and provide customers with integrated solutions, driving further adoption of its platform.\n\nThreats\n\nCybersecurity Risks and Industry Regulation: As a cybersecurity provider, CrowdStrike must continuously defend against sophisticated cyber threats, including those potentially enhanced by AI. Any significant breach or failure in its systems could result in reputational harm and financial loss. Additionally, the company must navigate a complex regulatory landscape, with the need to comply with evolving laws and regulations that could impact operations and costs.\n\nEconomic and Market Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as inflation and instability in global credit and financial markets pose threats to CrowdStrike's business. Economic downturns could lead to reduced IT spending and affect the company's growth trajectory. Moreover, the cybersecurity industry's rapid pace of change requires CrowdStrike to adapt quickly to emerging technologies and shifting market demands to maintain its competitive position.\n\nIn conclusion, CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) has demonstrated strong financial performance, with significant revenue growth and a successful transition to profitability. The company's innovative technology and strategic market positioning are key strengths that provide a solid foundation for future growth. However, challenges such as operational costs, competition, and market uncertainties require careful navigation. By leveraging opportunities for international expansion and strategic partnerships, while mitigating threats from cybersecurity risks and economic instability, CrowdStrike is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the cybersecurity space.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "Reporting their fourth quarter results this week, Abercrombie & Fitch ANF and CrowdStrike CRWD reconfirmed they have the expansion efforts that investors look for. The popular retail apparel company and innovative next-gen cyber security firm posted sound sales growth and strong improvements in profitability.\n\nMaking Abercrombie & Fitch and CrowdStrike shares more attractive is that their operating efficiency may sustain their impeccable year-to-date rallies. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRobust Q4 Growth\n\nOn Wednesday, Abercrombie & Fitch flexed its ability to capitalize on the holiday shopping season stating its Q4 net income came in at $158.4 million (Non-GAAP) and more than 300% above the $38.33 million the company brought in a year ago.\n\nThis translated into earnings of $2.97 per share which topped the Zacks Consensus by 5% and skyrocketed from $0.81 a share in the comparative quarter. On the top line, Q4 sales of $1.45 billion beat estimates by 2% and spiked 21% year over year. Pricing power along with lower operating costs attributed to the impressive holiday profit and Abercrombie & Fitch has surpassed earnings expectations in each of its last four quarterly reports.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs for CrowdStrike which reported its Q4 results on Tuesday, adoption of its endpoint cloud-delivered security services continues to accelerate. CrowdStrike achieved a fourth consecutive quarter of record net income at $236.2 million (Non-GAAP) which more than doubled from $111.6 million in the prior year quarter. Earnings of $0.95 per share soared 102% YoY and topped estimates by 16%. Quarterly sales expanded 34% to $845.34 million and beat by 1%.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with CRWD.\n\nOn March 5, 2024, CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD), a leader in cloud-delivered cybersecurity, announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024, which ended on January 31, 2024. The company released its 8-K filing, showcasing significant growth in key financial metrics, including a substantial increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and record net income. CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (CRWD) Reports Strong Fiscal Year 2024 Results with Record ARR and Net Income\n\nCrowdStrike, known for its Falcon platform, has continued to attract customers with its comprehensive cybersecurity solutions, leading to a 34% year-over-year growth in ARR, reaching $3.44 billion. The company's net new ARR growth accelerated to 27% year-over-year, reaching a record $282 million. This growth is indicative of CrowdStrike's strong market position and the increasing demand for cybersecurity solutions.\n\nFinancial Performance and Operational Highlights\n\nThe company's total revenue for the fourth quarter was $845.3 million, a 33% increase from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Subscription revenue, which is a critical indicator of the company's business health, was $795.9 million, marking a 33% increase from the previous fiscal year's quarter. For the full fiscal year 2024, total revenue was $3.06 billion, a 36% increase from fiscal 2023, with subscription revenue also up by 36%.\n\nImprovements in efficiency and scale were evident in the subscription gross margin, which saw GAAP and Non-GAAP margins increase to 78% and 80%, respectively. This improvement reflects CrowdStrike's ability to manage costs effectively while scaling its operations.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, CrowdStrike achieved its fourth consecutive quarter of record GAAP and Non-GAAP net income. GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike for the fourth quarter was $53.7 million, a significant turnaround from a loss of $47.5 million in the same quarter of the previous year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike was $236.2 million, more than doubling from $111.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nThe company's operational efficiency also translated into strong cash flow performance. Net cash generated from operations was $347.0 million for the quarter, and free cash flow was $283.0 million, compared to $209.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. CrowdStrike ended the fiscal year with $3.47 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.\n\nStrategic Acquisitions and Industry Recognition\n\nDuring the fiscal year, CrowdStrike continued to innovate and expand its offerings, including the acquisition of Flow Security and the expansion of its strategic partnership with Dell. The company was recognized as a leader in several industry reports, including the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms and The Forrester Wave reports for Cloud Workload Security and Managed Detection And Response Services In Europe.\n\nGeorge Kurtz, CrowdStrike's president, CEO, and co-founder, highlighted the company's consolidator, innovator, and platform of choice status in the cybersecurity industry. Burt Podbere, CrowdStrike's CFO, emphasized the company's focus on profitably scaling the business towards a $10 billion ARR and beyond.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nCrowdStrike provided guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, projecting total revenue between $902.2 and $905.8 million, and for the full fiscal year 2025, with revenue expected to be between $3.924.9 and $3.989.0 million. The company anticipates non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income to continue to grow, reflecting confidence in its business model and market opportunities.\n\nValue investors and potential GuruFocus.com members should note the robust financial health and growth trajectory of CrowdStrike, as evidenced by its latest earnings report.

        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript March 5, 2024\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.95, expectations were $0.82. CRWD isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to CrowdStrike's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Maria Riley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMaria Riley: Good afternoon, and thank you for your participation today. With me on the call are George Kurtz, President and Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of CrowdStrike; and Burt Podbere, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives, growth, including projections, and expected performance, including our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2025 and any assumptions for fiscal periods beyond that, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this call.\n\nWhile we believe any forward-looking statements we make are reasonable, actual results could differ materially because the statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including the section titled risk factors in the company's quarterly and annual report. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, excluding revenue, all financial measures disclosed on this call will be non-GAAP.\n\nStory continues\n\nA discussion of why we use non-GAP financial measures and a reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is currently available in our earnings press release, which may be found on the investor relations website at ir.crowdstrike.com or on our form 8-K filed with the SEC today. With that, I will now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kurtz: Thank you, Maria. And thank you all for joining us today. CrowdStrike delivered an exceptional fourth quarter that far exceeded our expectations. It was another quarter of records. Record net new ARR of $282 million, continuing our acceleration trend, growing 27% year-over-year. Record operating margin of 25%, up 10 percentage points year-over-year. Record free cash flow reaching 33% of revenue and a free cash flow Rule of 66. Record GAAP profitability and record cloud identity and next-gen SIEM ending ARR of greater than $850 million together, more than doubling year-over-year. These results illustrate CrowdStrike's substantial and widening competitive moat, exceptional business acceleration, and validated market leadership.\n\nBuilding on my founding vision, CrowdStrike is the only single platform, single agent technology in cybersecurity that solves use cases well beyond endpoint protection. Falcon is the easiest and fastest cybersecurity technology to deploy, and our single AI native platform makes vendor consolidation instant, frictionless and natural. The feedback we receive from customers, prospects and partners alike is consistent, eagerness to deploy the Falcon platform, ease of adopting more Falcon platform modules, and excitement from continuous innovation with new Falcon capabilities delivered weekly. Leaving stitched together point products and PowerPoint platforms behind, CrowdStrike customers realize the benefits of superior outcomes and lower TCO. A recent IDC report echoes this, showcasing $6 of return for every dollar invested in the Falcon platform.\n\nThat is ROI. Free is never free. Customers understand the difference between product pricing and the total lifetime cost of operating inferior technology. Given the Falcon platform's ROI and TCO savings, we believe we will continue to see favorable pricing dynamics. I'm thrilled with our performance, which is a testament to the execution and passion from the very best team in cybersecurity. Unified by our focused mission, we stop breaches. My gratitude to all CrowdStriker\u2019s on a job well done. Our execution and discipline across the business, coupled with overwhelmingly positive market feedback, gives me strong conviction in our fiscal year 2025 momentum, which Burt will cover in more detail. The current macro environment remains stable and consistent with prior quarters.\n\nWe expect continued deal scrutiny throughout this coming year. We remain focused on operational excellence, while delivering market-leading growth at scale, assisting organizations of all sizes to consolidate and improve their cybersecurity. In contrast to the macroeconomic backdrop, the state of the threat landscape has never been more elevated. In CrowdStrike's recent 2024 Global Threat Report, we unpack the harsh realities of cyber today. Key findings include: first, attacks are faster than ever. What took adversaries hours has shrunk to minutes and seconds. Attack speeds will only accelerate. Second, the cloud is increasingly under attack. We tracked a 75% increase in cloud intrusion attempts. The cloud is today's battleground for cyberattacks.\n\nAnd third, generative AI is an adversary force multiplier. GenAI puts advanced cybercrime tradecraft in the hands of attackers of all skill levels, Gen.AI will dramatically grow the adversary population. The Global Threat Report showcases our threat intelligence leadership. We collect trillions of threat signals daily, creating one of the world's largest and fastest growing cyber threat data sets. From day one, we've been an AI company, training the industry's most effective and accurate AI models to prevent attacks based upon our data moat. Embedded in the Falcon platform is a virtuous data cycle where we collect cybersecurity's very best threat intelligence data, build and train robust preventative and generative models, and protect CrowdStrike customers with community immunity.\n\nOur team of data science PhDs operate this continuous and real-time process, constantly evolving Falcon's AI foundation to predict adversary activity and stay ahead of threats. Our ever-growing data corpus and unique access to Cyber's freshest data at the source alongside our technology and our human incident response, threat analysts, data science, and engineering expertise, together serve as a structural competitive advantage. Along with AI, cybersecurity is a top priority in my discussions with numerous boards. In today's environment of heightened cyberattacks, the latest SEC breach disclosure regulation only increases the pressure on companies and their boards. We regularly assist boards with regulation readiness by bringing cybersecurity from the back room to the boardroom.\n\nThis, alongside the severity of the threat landscape, makes effective cybersecurity an increasingly mission critical necessity. That said, cybersecurity today is a frenetic vendor bizarre. Disjointed point feature copycat products clutter the market, attempting to band-aid symptoms instead of curing the illness. OS vendors use their market position to create a monoculture of dependence and risk, and in many cases serve as the breach originator. Even worse, multi-platform hardware vendors evangelize their stitched together patchwork of point products masquerading as thinly veiled piecemeal platforms. And what organizations inevitably realize is that, vendor lock-in leads to deployment difficulties, sky-rocketing costs, and subpar cybersecurity.\n\nThe outcome is shelf wear and sunk costs. ELA and bundling addiction become the only way to coast customers into purchasing non-integrated point products. If the organization trapped in these fragmented pseudo platforms riddled with bolt-on point products that are the ones suffering from fatigue. In stark juxtaposition, what CrowdStrike customers tell us is that, when you build the right single data-centric AI platform, deliver the right frictionless native solution, and architect the right go-to-market organizations purchase because they need more, receive more, and understand how cybersecurity transformation saves them time and money. Our deal metrics validate this. First, record deal volumes. In Q4, we closed more than 250 deals greater than $1 million in deal value, more than 490 deals greater than $500,000 in deal value, and more than 1,900 deals greater than $100,000 in deal value.\n\nDeal counts grew by more than 30% year-over-year across all deal segments. Second, record platform adoption, deals with eight or more modules more than doubled year-over-year. And lastly, continued rising win rates. In Q4, we saw steadily rising win rates across the board, validating our technological leadership over the competition. These results are driven by the following: the winning AI platform, the right solution, and our frictionless go-to-market motion. Let me begin with our winning AI platform. The secret to cybersecurity's leading platform is our single platform has one console and one agent. It solves an ever-expanding set of cybersecurity and IT use cases. Our single platform is open. Our single platform is data-centric, AI native, and scalable, delivering immediate times of value.\n\nKey wins prove the value of the Falcon platform, which makes point product consolidation and vendor replacement a reality. A recent seven-figure win in a Fortune 1000 company highlights how our platform consolidates at scale. Falcon replaced an OS security vendor, a legacy AV vendor, and a next-gen vendor. We eliminated multiple Microsoft consoles and multiple agents to a single console, single agent, and single platform of Falcon. Our platform approach organically inspires customers to deploy Falcon cloud security as their first CSPM, CIEM and ASPM. solutions. An eight-figure multi-year win in a Fortune 100 business where the Falcon platform displays five different products. With recent breaches costing them hundreds of millions, it costs too much to keep using ineffective cybersecurity tools.\n\nThey purchased EDR, Next-gen AV, Identity, file integrity monitoring, and vulnerability management, reducing the number of agents on their devices by approximately 50%. What used to require five installs is now done with one. There are countless similar stories. Our platform approach makes landing with multiple solutions at once easy and adopting increasing capabilities over time and organic experience. We collect data once and reuse it many times for today's and tomorrow's use cases. Our application of GenAI makes cybersecurity predictive and accessible for all skill levels. It's all on one platform, one agent, and one integrated workflow. Next, delivering the right solutions. Our market-leading cloud security, identity protection, and next-gen SIEM solutions are in demand, because they solve painful customer problems.\n\nThese businesses collectively are more than doubling year-over-year. Each are IPOable businesses and each play lead roles in Falcon platform consolidation. I'd like to start with our breakout cloud security solution where we are setting new records and winning at scale. Our cloud security momentum accelerated in the quarter with net new ARR growing nearly 200% year-over-year. At more than $400 million in ending ARR, CrowdStrike is one of the largest cloud security businesses in the market and was recently positioned as a market leader in Forrester's cloud security wave. Here are a few recent cloud security wins. An eight figure multi-year win in a hyper-growth AI company. This company's endpoint footprint is in the low thousand. However, with its rapidly expanding cloud estate, this transaction marks our largest inside sales deal of all time.\n\nFalcon Cloud Security protects their LLM development and cloud environment. This customer uses CrowdStrike for CSPM, CIEM, CWP and ASPM. From the SMB to large enterprises, our sellers and partners win with Falcon Cloud Security. A leading hyperscaler grew its use of Falcon Cloud Security, praising our Linux capabilities. This large eight-figure transaction takes us deeper into the account where we're not only on every device, but now across large parts of their cloud. The win extends CrowdStrike leadership in securing the world's largest clouds. A global financial services giant replaced their Palo Alto Prisma Cloud products in a large seven-figure deal. The Palo Alto cloud security products required separate management consoles and separate agents because cloud security is on a separate Palo Alto platform altogether.\n\nCrowdStrike was able to deliver an expected 70% time reduction in management as well as more than $5 million in annual staffing cost savings. The patchwork of multi-product, multi-agent, multi-console, separate platform technologies resulted in visibility gaps, asynchronous alerts, and overall fatigue managing cloud security. Falcon single platform with its integrated cloud security components was a win for the customer. Customers are starting to realize that CSPM doesn't stop the breach. It is a compliance and reporting tool. Cloud security has moved beyond CSPM. Customers are increasingly realizing that a holistic suite encompassing runtime protection is the only way to protect from active real-time threats. CrowdStrike built the first native single agent and agentless cloud security solution.\n\nWe've taken cloud security beyond CSPM to include CIEM for securing cloud identity, ASPM for locating, controlling, and securing cloud applications, CWP to stop malicious behavior and breaches. And now we turn to securing the cloud data itself that flows in and out of the cloud. Turning our cloud security focus to data, we're incredibly excited to announce our intended acquisition of Flow Security. Flow stood out as the most unique technology amongst a sea of early startups by delivering the industry's first and only cloud data runtime security solution. Let me explain. The majority of companies in cloud data security focus on two things: discovery and classification. Here's where Flow stands apart. Runtime data discovery and classification.\n\nData is analyzed, pre and post-decryption, enabling precise and instant results. Real-time and continuous data visibility, a live view into data risk, not just at rest but also in motion with LLM-powered adaptive policies. Data leakage prevention, the ability to block data exfiltration, including the data exposed through GenAI services. Simply put, Flow is the industry's first and only cloud data runtime security solution. Flow will also enhance our native data protection module, which is off to a great start already replacing legacy DLP products in Fortune 500 accounts. Customer frustration with legacy DLP is at a fever pitch, similar to the days of legacy AV, where outdated products overstayed their welcome. We will now be able to offer a cloud centric next gen alternative, addressing a market currently shackled by ineffective legacy vendors, estimated to be an $8 billion TAM in CY 28.\n\nWith Flow, we will have the most comprehensive data protection from code to application, to device to cloud focused on stopping breaches. Next, let's look at identity protection which surpassed $300 million in ARR, more than doubling year-over-year. Q4 was also a record quarter of net new identity customer adds. With 80% of attacks involving identity vectors, we've made identity protection standard fare for modern cybersecurity, because it is already integrated into our single agent. Other vendors attempt to offer identity protection through non-integrated afterthought features or simply lack identity protection altogether. Our identity threat detection and response module remains the market's only single-agent solution that stops lateral movement, protects credentials, and secures where identities are actually born, active directory. Security personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time.\n\nWins from the quarter include a seven-figure deal with a mega cruise line using a next-gen product that can never be fully deployed. Upgrades and operations were a disaster. When I personally met with them, they were beyond frustrated with being the quality control test bed and tired of too many incidents that slipped past their current vendor. Our identity solution delivered in one, not two agents, sets the Falcon platform apart. An eight-figure transaction with a major chip manufacturer added identity to their Falcon deployment. Trapped in a large Microsoft ELA, this organization realized Microsoft needed to bring in a startup to augment its current offering. This piecemeal approach to identity protection created a massive burden of deploying another unproven agent.\n\nThe customer saw the immediate value of Falcon identity. Our single agent and single platform approach reduced their Microsoft dependency. Lastly, let's discuss LogScale next-gen SIEM, an inflecting Falcon platform solution. We added record net new next-gen SIEM ARR in Q4, growing over 170% year-over-year. As of the end of Q4, our next-gen SEIM-ending ARR is now greater than $150 million, selected by well over 1,000 customers. Our next-gen SEIM is quickly emerging as the go-to splunk alternative for all businesses looking to leave legacy SEIMs. Following M&A consolidation in the legacy SEIM market and mounting dissatisfaction with a slew of withering SEIMs, the market is hungry for better technology, lower TCO, and instant time to value. In LogScale next-gen SEIM, all CrowdStrike data is already resident, saving the expense and time of data transfer.\n\nCustomers are looking to standardize on the right cloud-native data centric platform for actioning their data, where they're manually searching, using automated AI power queries, or trusting partners to manage their next-gen SIEM Falcon experience. With pipeline already in the hundreds of millions, there's overwhelming interest in LogScale next-gen SIEM. One of many noteworthy wins from the quarter was in partnership with Deloitte, which has a hyper-growth LogScale next-gen SEIM practice. Together, we closed a seven-figure multi-year next-gen SEIM deal with a large European manufacturer displacing Splunk and [Elastics] (ph) and beating out Azure Sentinel. This customer now has 16 Falcon platform modules deployed. A major mobile computing company standardized our LogScale next-gen SIEM in a seven figure multi-year deal, replacing a legacy SIEM.\n\nWe competed against Palo Alto's XIM. The customer was looking for an open architecture versus a closed, vendor locked-in approach to cybersecurity. The complexity of having to deploy many different Palo Alto products and multiple agents made CrowdStrike an even easier choice. Lastly, a Fortune 500 hospitality brand grew its relationship with us, again, displacing Splunk and Azure Sentinel in a seven-figure deal. In partnership with EY and their global LogScale next-gen SIEM practice, this customer grew their SIEM use cases by bringing in security and IP data more than before, retaining that data for years and benefiting from faster searches. LogScale next-gen SIEM was significantly faster than Azure Sentinel, with a substantially lower total cost of operation, which helped drive this win.\n\nOur LogScale next-gen SIEM wins illustrate our sticky and growing data gravity within businesses of all sizes. I can confidently say LogScale next-gen SIEM is one of the fastest growing SIEM solutions on the market today. Our pace of innovation has never been faster. We're incredibly excited to announce that Falcon for IT and Charlotte AI are generally available. As our customers look to solve increasingly complex IT challenges across their heterogeneous environments, Falcon for IT excitement is palpable. Our customers are also excited about the GenAI productivity gains from Charlotte AI, where over 80% of our beta users believe they will save hours to days of work each week using Charlotte AI. The third and final driver of CrowdStrike's growth at scale is our frictionless go-to-market.\n\nI'm a big believer that customers don't buy what they don't need and should never be forced to do so. At Falcon, we announced Falcon Flex, a flexible licensing model where we enable customers to use the products they want, when they want, over the course of a multi-year subscription term. Falcon Flex drives customer stickiness, enabling larger lands and helping us expand with customers adopting more Falcon platform solutions faster. A recent noteworthy Falcon Flex deal was a multi-million dollar transaction with a Fortune 500 technology company that leveraged Falcon Flex to go all in with Falcon, consolidating and displacing legacy IT hiking products, point cloud products, and legacy DLP products. The right platform, solutions, and go-to-market make us the partner ecosystems leading choice.\n\nSome partnership highlights include: accelerating momentum with Dell. Since announcing our Dell partnership last year, we've transacted more than $50 million of total deal value together with customers in every segment and geography. We're in the early innings of where this partnership is going, and I'm thrilled with the momentum that we have with Dell as they standardize new offerings, such as their own MDR service on Falcon. Our MSSP business is growing by triple digits year-over-year, fueled by the right technology, strategy, and partners. MSSP increasingly want the platform, not part of the platform, to power cybersecurity transformation. MSSP are bringing Falcon to tens of thousands of SMBs who lack the staff and time, but still need the outcome of the industry's best cybersecurity.\n\nOur AWS Marketplace business continues to accelerate at scale, surpassing $1 billion in sales. The AWS Marketplace continues to be one of the fastest growing routes to market. A vast majority of our Marketplace business also transacts through resellers and SIs, where we've unified partners and cloud marketplaces for ease, speed, and end customer value. The Falcon platform is validated, tested, and certified. Industry analysts regularly recognize Falcon in our leadership. Here are two recent examples. First, the Gartner's EPP Magic Quadrant. Our placement speaks for itself. CrowdStrike's positioning as highest inability to execute and furthest to the right in completeness of vision and this year's Magic Quadrant solidifies our unequivocal market leadership ahead of Microsoft and every other vendor profile.\n\nSecond, the farthest away for cloud security place CrowdStrike as one of only two leaders in the entire cloud security market, ranking highest provision and innovation. In conclusion, CrowdStrike single agent, single unified data centric platform, and our mission to stop breaches sets us apart. In starting the company, we brought cybersecurity to the cloud. We pioneered AI for cybersecurity. And we've quickly become the de facto security platform that disrupts, displaces, and consolidates other vendors. I couldn't be more excited about the year we completed, as well as our bright future. CrowdStrike's contribution to cybersecurity goes beyond technology. It's the power of the Crowd. We are cybersecurity's community. When cybersecurity professionals apply for jobs, CrowdStrike certification is the required skill set.\n\nIn the reseller and ISV ecosystem, CrowdStrike is at the top of the line card. In SOCs across every vertical and geography, CrowdStrike is the security operating system. It's CrowdStrike that's on the screen. When talking about the threat landscape, CrowdStrike pioneered commercial threat intelligence that governments and companies of all sizes depend on. It's CrowdStrike that delivers billions of new threat detections every month to stop the breach. It's CrowdStrike that is the search bar of security where analysts complete millions of XDR queries daily. It's CrowdStrike that created cyber security's first dedicated GenAI stock assistant to make every user a power user. It's CrowdStrike where more than half a million cybersecurity defenders log in every day to protect society by stopping breaches.\n\nThe technology, the crowd, the mission, This is what makes CrowdStrike cybersecurity definitive platform. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.\n\nBurt Podbere: Thank you, George. And good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. CrowdStrike delivered an exceptional fourth quarter and a record finish to the year, highlighting our outstanding execution, growing market leadership, and accelerating adoption of the Falcon platform. For the full fiscal year, we achieved 34% and 36% ending ARR and revenue growth, respectively, while delivering significant leverage on the bottom line. Operating income grew 86% year-over-year to reach a record $660.3 million, or 22% of revenue, and net income attributable to CrowdStrike and EPS more than doubled to reach a record $751.8 million or $3.09 per diluted share.\n\nFree cash flow grew 39% year-over-year to reach $938.2 million or 31% of revenue, exceeding our target for the year. Additionally, we are very proud to have achieved the important milestone of GAAP profitability for the past four quarters and full fiscal year in less than five years following our IPO. Our achievements in fiscal year 2024 represent another high watermark for CrowdStrike. Through our consistent focus on execution, we have efficiently scaled the business, growing ending ARR by over 10 time from our IPO in fiscal year 2019, delivering significant operating leverage and growing our free cash flow margin profile to above 30%. We continue to aggressively invest in our innovation engine and flight the company to achieve its vision of reaching $10 billion in ARR over the next five to seven years.\n\nMoving to the specifics of the fourth quarter, we achieved record net new ARR of $282 million, up 27% off of last year's record Q4, representing our second consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. And we finished the quarter with $3.44 billion in ending ARR, up 34% over last year. Demand in the quarter was broad-based and we have a record Q1 pipeline as we executed on our platform strategy, closed many large consolidation deals, and extended our leadership across the market from large enterprises to small businesses. While companies may be fatigued with other vendors, they have embraced CrowdStrike's platform strategy and want to buy more of the Falcon platform. This is evidenced by: first, the number of deals with eight or more modules more than doubling year-over-year in Q4; second, subscription customers were five or more, six or more, and seven or more modules growing to 64%, 43%, and 27% of subscription customers respectively; third, the number of customers with greater than $1 million of ending ARR growing to more than $580; and finally, the growth of deals with total value exceeding $1 million accelerated to over 30% and reached an all-time record at over $250 million in Q4.\n\nWe finished the year with 29,000 subscription customers, which excludes smaller customers served through our MSSP partners. We are landing bigger with new customers on average, adopting 4.9 modules out of the gate, an increase over last year. Our gross retention rate remained high at 98% and our dollar-based net retention rate was consistent with last quarter at 119%, which is slightly below our benchmark as the mix of net new ARR from new customers has remained above our expectations and we continue to land bigger deals. For the interim FY 2024 quarters, net retention was 119% in Q3, 119% in Q2, and 122% in Q1. Looking into FY 2025, we expect our dollar-based net retention rate to fluctuate within plus or minus a few points of 120% as the business scales to even greater heights and customers continue to land bigger and with more modules.\n\nMoving to the P&L, total revenue grew 33% over Q4 of last year to reach $845.3 million. Subscription revenue grew 33% over Q4 of last year to reach $795.9 million. Professional services revenue was $49.4 million, representing 26% year-over-year growth. The geographic mix of fourth quarter revenue consisted of approximately 68% from the U.S., 16% from Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 10% from the Asia Pacific region, and 6% from all other markets. Total gross margin increased by 282 basis points year-over-year to reach 78% and subscription gross margin was above 80% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 291 basis points over the prior year. Our strong gross margin performance was driven by our ability to command stable pricing, supported by the exceptional customer value delivered by the Falcon platform, as well as our continued investment in data center and workload optimization.\n\nTotal non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $448.1 million, or 53% of revenue, compared to 60% of revenue in the prior year. Our strategic investments in talent and innovation underpin our ability to scale the business and deliver profitable growth. In the fourth quarter, non-GAAP operating income grew 123% year-over-year to reach a record $213.1 million, and operating margin increased by 10 percentage points year-over-year to reach a record 25%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q4 grew to a record $236.2 million, or $0.95 on a diluted per share basis, each more than doubling year-over-year. Our weighted average common shares used to calculate fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS attributable to CrowdStrike was on a diluted basis and totaled approximately 248 million shares.\n\nWe ended the fourth quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments grew to a record $3.47 billion. Cash flow from operations was a record $347.0 million. Free cash flow reached a record $283.0 million, or 33% of revenue, achieving a Rule of 66 on a free cash flow basis. Before I move to our outlook, I'd like to provide a few modeling notes. First, we are encouraged by the momentum in the business, including larger deal sizes, increased win rates, and a record Q1 pipeline. However, we continue to maintain a consistent and prudent approach to our outlook amid a macro environment that remains challenging, and therefore the guidance we are providing today assumes a consistent, challenging macro backdrop.\n\nSecond, while we do not specifically guide to ending or net new ARR, given the incredible performance of Q4, I will share our current seasonality assumptions with respect to net new ARR and Q1, which calls for Q1 net new ARR year-over-year growth to be at least double digits up to the low teens. Third, given our strong momentum in the market, we are increasing our pace of hiring in FY 2025 as we continue to invest in our innovation engine and go to market functions to scale the business to $10 billion of ARR and beyond. As a result of increased hiring in the first half of the year, changes to the timing of our merit cycle and the timing of certain marketing programs, we expect operating leverage to be more weighted to the back half of FY25.\n\nNext, we are raising our free cash flow target for FY 2025 from between 30% and 32% to between 31% and 33% of revenue. Our assumptions on interest income and expense, CapEx and cash outlay for taxes will be included after this call in our earnings presentation available on our investor relations website. Moving to our outlook. For the first quarter of FY 2025, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $902.2 million to $905.8 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 30% to 31%. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $188.1 million to $190.8 million. And non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $220.4 million to $223.1 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.89 to $0.90 cents utilizing a weighted average share count of 248 million shares on a diluted basis.\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2025, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3,924.9 million to $3,989.0 million, reflecting a growth rate of 28% to 31% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $863.6 million and $913.0 million. We expect fiscal 2025 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $940.3 million and $989.7 million. Utilizing 250 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $3.77 to $3.97.

        "content": "On Tuesday, CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: CRWD) surpassed both top and bottom-line estimates with its fourth quarter results. The shares of the cybersecurity company surged more than 20% during after-hours trading as CrowdStrike also issued a better-than-expected outlook for both the current quarter and fiscal year ahead.\n\nFourth Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on January 31st, CrowdStrike reported revenue expanded\u00a033%\u00a0YoY to\u00a0$845 million, surpassing estimates of $839 million. An essential part of its business is subscription revenue that solely grew also 44% YoY to\u00a0$795.9 million.\u00a0CrowdStrike also made a turnaround from last year\u2019s comparable quarter when it reported a\u00a0$48 million loss\u00a0to now reporting a net income of\u00a0$54 million, or 22 cents per share. CFO Burt Podbere\u00a0noted that CrowdStrike has been reporting a GAAP net income over the past four quarters,\n\nFiscal First Quarter Outlook\n\nCrowdStrike guided for\u00a0revenue between $902 million and $906 million, surpassing the consensus estimate of $899 million, and providing the earnings per share outlook in the range between\u00a089\u00a0cents and 90 cents, also topping the consensus estimate of 82 cents.\n\nOver the recent months, CrowdStrike has been stepping up its M&A game.\n\nCrowdStrike is doing a great job at navigating the competitive environment as it targets the cloud as its next major growth area, with CEO George Kurtz acknowledging that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) will always be a competitive threat. After all, Microsoft is trusted by the world\u2019s biggest enterprises in part due to its promise of security. However, even Microsoft has had a few rough years of cybersecurity incidents. Fortunately, as technology continues to evolve, there can never be enough of cybersecurity so being a Microsoft customer does not exclude also being a CrowdStrike customer. Besides Microsoft Azure, there\u2019s also Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) who ended 2023 by revealing its new AI security assistant. With this major milestone, Cisco is aiming to redefine cybersecurity defense with powerful AI capabilities. Claiming to have unmatched visibility across the network, Cisco trained its AI assistant on one of the largest security-focused data set. Cisco revealed its AI Assistant analyzes more than 550 billion security events each day. Therefore, with the AI Assistant, Cisco aims to tip the scales in favor of defenders by helping organizations make informed decisions. As cyber-attacks continue to evolve, defenses must do the same and therefore, CrowdStrike is set to benefit from its M&A activities. With the release, CrowdStrike also announced its acquisition of Flow which will expand its reach in cloud security.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Podbere reiterated the company\u2019s goal of achieving $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of the decade, having now reached\u00a0$3.4 billion\u00a0for the year that ended this January.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Keeping with that theme, while forward guidance for the next quarter and the full year were only slightly above expectations, non-GAAP EPS guidance was more convincingly ahead, showing better-than-expected profitability.\n\nLastly, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) warned of weakness in security spending a few weeks ago when it reported earnings, sending waves of caution across the sector. Cybersecurity peers that reported after Palo Alto put up mixed results, which kept investors on edge for CrowdStrike's results.\n\nThese results could signal a shift in sentiment given CrowdStrike's popularity within the cyber security space, especially considering its cloud security capabilities.\n\nIs now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nCrowdStrike's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 17 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for CrowdStrike and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was about 22 hours ago, when the company dropped 6.8% as stocks declined, with investors likely taking profits. The Nasdaq fell 1.6%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.9%. Some of the big tech names felt the heat, with Tesla, Netflix, and Microsoft all declining by more than 2%. Notably, iPhone manufacturer Apple was also down nearly 3% following a research report by Counterpoint that suggested a decline in iPhone sales in China in the first six weeks of the year. The weak demand report could signal that the purchasing power of consumers in the region is weakening. Otherwise, we have found no other fundamental or rate-related reasons explaining the broad market decline. It is a week packed with information for investors to digest.\n\nStory continues\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell will give updates to Congress on March 6th and 7th, 2024, about the current monetary outlook, recent policy actions, and progress toward bringing inflation back down. Finally, on March 8th, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report nonfarm payrolls for the month of February. The insight gleaned from the economic data and updates during the week could inform the market's outlook on equities and other assets for better or worse. Investors expect the Fed to begin cutting rates this year, with the expectation of the first rate cut as early as the first half of the year.\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nCrowdStrike is up 38% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike's shares at the IPO in June 2019 would now be looking at an investment worth $5,876.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

(Operator Instructions) \r\nI would now like to hand the call over to Maria Riley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMaria Riley\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for your participation today. With me on the call are George Kurtz, President and Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of CrowdStrike and Burt Podbere, Chief Financial Officer. \r\nBefore we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives, growth, including projections and expected performance, including our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2025 and any assumptions for fiscal periods beyond that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. \r\nThese forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this call. While we believe any forward-looking statements we make are reasonable, actual results could differ materially because the statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in the company's quarterly and annual reports. \r\nAdditionally, unless otherwise stated, excluding revenue, all financial measures disclosed on this call will be non-GAAP. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is currently available in our earnings press release, which may be found on the Investor Relations website at ir.crowdstrike.com or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC today. \r\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to George.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us today. \r\nCrowdStrike delivered an exceptional fourth quarter that far exceeded our expectations. It was another quarter of records. Record net new ARR of $282 million, continuing our acceleration trend, growing 27% year-over-year. Record operating margin of 25%, up 10 percentage points year-over-year. Record free cash flow reaching 33% of revenue and a free cash flow Rule of 66. Record GAAP profitability and record cloud identity and next-gen SIEM ending ARR of greater than $850 million together more than doubling year-over-year. \r\nThese results illustrate CrowdStrike's substantial and widening competitive moat, exceptional business acceleration and validated market leadership. Building on my founding vision, CrowdStrike is the only single platform single-agent technology in cybersecurity that solves use cases well beyond endpoint protection. Falcon is the easiest and fastest cybersecurity technology to deploy and our single AI native platform makes vendor consolidation instant, frictionless and natural. The feedback we receive from customers, prospects and partners alike is consistent: eagerness to deploy the Falcon platform, ease of adopting more Falcon platform modules and excitement from continuous innovation with new Falcon capabilities delivered weekly. \r\nLeaving stitched together point products and power point platforms behind, CrowdStrike customers realize the benefits of superior outcomes and lower TCO. A recent IDC report echoes this, showcasing $6 of return for every dollar invested in the Falcon platform. That is ROI. Free is never free. Customers understand the difference between product pricing and the total lifetime cost of operating inferior technology. Given the Falcon Platform's ROI and TCO savings, we believe we will continue to see favorable pricing dynamics. \r\nI'm thrilled with our performance, which is a testament to the execution and passion from the very best team in cybersecurity unified by our focused mission: we stop breaches. My gratitude to all CrowdStrikers on a job well done. Our execution and discipline across the business coupled with overwhelmingly positive market feedback, gives me strong conviction in our fiscal year 2025 momentum, which Burt will cover in more detail. \r\nThe current macro environment remains stable and consistent with prior quarters. We expect continued deal scrutiny throughout this coming year. We remain focused on operational excellence while delivering market-leading growth at scale, assisting organizations of all sizes to consolidate and improve their cybersecurity. \r\nIn contrast to the macroeconomic backdrop, the state of the threat landscape has never been more elevated. In CrowdStrike's recent 2024 Global Threat Report, we unpacked the harsh realities of cyber today. Key findings include: First, attacks are faster than ever. What took adversaries hours has shrunk to minutes in seconds, attack speeds will only accelerate. Second, the cloud is increasingly under attack. We tracked a 75% increase in cloud intrusion attempts. The cloud is today's battleground for cyberattacks. And third, generative AI is an adversary force multiplier. Gen AI puts advanced cybercrime trade craft in the hands of attackers of all skill levels. Gen AI will dramatically grow the adversary population. \r\nThe Global Threat Report showcases our threat intelligence leadership. We collect trillions of threat signals daily creating one of the world's largest and fastest-growing cyber threat data set. From day 1, we've been an AI company, training the industry's most effective and accurate AI models to prevent attacks based upon our data moat. \r\nEmbedded in the Falcon platform is a virtuous data cycle where we collect cybersecurity's very best threat intelligence data, build and train robust preventative and generative models and protect CrowdStrike customers with community immunity. Our team of data science PhDs operate this continuous and real-time process, constantly evolving Falcon's AI foundation to predict adversary activity and stay ahead of threats. Our ever-growing data corpus and unique access to cyber's freshest data at the source alongside our technology and our human incident response, threat analysts, data science and engineering expertise together serve as a structural competitive advantage. \r\nAlong with AI, cybersecurity is a top priority in my discussions with numerous boards. In today's environment of heightened cyber attacks, the latest SEC breach disclosure regulation only increases the pressure on companies and their boards. We regularly assist boards with regulation readiness by bringing cybersecurity from the back room to the boardroom. This, alongside the severity of the threat landscape makes effective cybersecurity and increasingly mission-critical necessity. \r\nThat said, cybersecurity today is a frenetic vendor bazaar. Disjointed point feature copycat products clutter the market attempting to Band-Aid symptoms instead of curing the illness. OS vendors use their market position to create a monoculture of dependence and risk, and in many cases, serve as the breach originator. Even worse, multi-platform hardware vendors evangelized their stitched together patchwork of point products, masquerading as thinly veiled piecemeal platforms. And what organizations inevitably realize is that vendor lock-in leads to deployment difficulties, skyrocketing cost and subpar cybersecurity. The outcome is shelfware and sunk costs. ELA and bundling addiction become the only way to coax customers into purchasing nonintegrated point products. It's the organization trapped in these fragmented pseudo platforms riddled with bolt-on point products that are the ones suffering from fatigue. \r\nIn stark juxtaposition, what CrowdStrike customers tell us is that when you build the right single data-centric AI platform, deliver the right frictionless native solutions and architect the right go-to-market, organizations purchase because they need more, receive more and understand how cybersecurity transformation saves them time and money. Our deal metrics validate this. \r\nFirst, record deal volumes. In Q4, we closed more than 250 deals greater than $1 million in deal value, more than 490 deals greater than $500,000 in deal value and more than 1,900 deals greater than $100,000 in deal value. Deal counts grew by more than 30% year-over-year across all deal segments. Second, record platform adoption. Deals with 8 or more modules more than doubled year-over-year. And lastly, continued rising win rates. In Q4, we saw steadily rising win rates across the board, validating our technological leadership over the competition. These results are driven by the following: the winning AI platform, the right solutions and our frictionless go-to-market motion. \r\nLet me begin with our winning AI platform. The secret to cybersecurity's leading platform is our single platform has one console and one agent. It solves an ever-expanding set of cybersecurity and IT use cases. Our single platform is open. Our single platform is data-centric, AI native and scalable, delivering immediate time to value. \r\nKey wins proved the value of the Falcon platform, which makes point product consolidation and vendor replacement a reality. Our recent 7-figure win in a Fortune 1000 company highlights how our platform consolidates at scale. Falcon replaced an OS security vendor, a legacy AV vendor and a next-gen vendor. We eliminated multiple Microsoft consoles and multiple agents to a single console, single agent and single platform of Falcon. Our platform approach organically inspires customers to deploy Falcon Cloud Security as their first CSPM, CIEM and ASPM solution. \r\nAn 8-figure multiyear win in a Fortune 100 business where the Falcon platform displaced 5 different products with recent breaches costing them hundreds of millions and costs too much to keep using ineffective cybersecurity tool. They purchased EDR, Next-Gen AV, Identity, biointegrity monitoring and vulnerability management, reducing the number of agents on their devices by approximately 50%. What used to require 5 installs is now done with 1. \r\nThere are countless similar stories. Our platform approach makes landing with multiple solutions at once easy and adopting increasing capabilities over time an organic experience. We collect data once and reuse it many times for today's and tomorrow's use cases. Our application of Gen AI makes cybersecurity predictive and accessible for all skill levels. It's all on one platform, one agent and one integrated workflow. \r\nNext, delivering the right solutions our market-leading cloud security, identity protection and next-gen SIEM solutions are in demand because they solve painful customer problems. These businesses collectively are more than doubling year-over-year, each are IPO-able businesses and each play lead roles in Falcon platform consolidation. \r\nI'd like to start with our breakout cloud security solutions where we are setting new records and winning at scale. Our cloud security momentum accelerated in the quarter. With net new ARR growing nearly 200% year-over-year and more than $400 million in ending ARR CrowdStrike, is one of the largest cloud security businesses in the market and was recently positioned as a market leader in Forrester's cloud security wave. \r\nHere are a few recent cloud security wins. An 8-figure multiyear win in a hypergrowth AI company. This company's endpoint footprint is in the low thousands. However, with its rapidly expanding cloud estate, this transaction marks our largest inside sales deal of all time. Falcon Cloud Security protects their LLM development and cloud environment. This customer uses CrowdStrike Core, CSPM, CIEM, CWP and ASPM. From the SMB to large enterprises, our sellers and partners win with Falcon Cloud Security. \r\nA leading hyperscaler grew its use of Falcon Cloud Security, praising our Linux capabilities. This large 8-figure transaction takes us deeper into the account where we're not only on every device, but now across large parts of their cloud. The win extends CrowdStrike leadership in securing the world's largest clouds. \r\nA global financial services giant replaced their Palo Alto Prisma Cloud products in a large 7-figure deal. The Palo Alto Cloud Security products required separate management consoles and separate agents because cloud security is on a separate Palo Alto platform altogether. CrowdStrike was able to deliver an expected 70% time reduction in management as well as more than $5 million in annual staffing cost savings. The patchwork of multiproduct, multi-agent multi-console separate platform technologies resulted in visibility gaps, asynchronous alerts and overall fatigue managing cloud security. Falcon's single platform with its integrated cloud security component was a win for the customer. \r\nCustomers are starting to realize that CSPM doesn't stop the breach. It is a compliance and reporting tool. Cloud security has moved beyond CSPM. Customers are increasingly realizing that a holistic suite encompassing runtime protection is the only way to protect from active real-time threats. CrowdStrike built the first native single agent and agentless cloud security solution. We've taken cloud security beyond CSPM to include CIEM for securing cloud identity, ASPM for locating, controlling and securing cloud applications, CWP to stop malicious behavior and breaches. And now we turn to securing the cloud data itself that flows in and out of the cloud. \r\nTurning our cloud security focus to date. We're incredibly excited to announce our intended acquisition of Flow security. Flow stood out as the most unique technology amongst a sea of early start-ups by delivering the industry's first and only cloud data runtime security solution. \r\nLet me explain. The majority of companies and cloud data security focus on 2 things: discovery and classification. Here's where Flow stands apart: Runtime data discovery and classification. Data is analyzed, pre and post decryption, enabling precise and instant results; Real time and continuous data visibility, a live view into data risk, not just at rest, but also in motion with LLM powered adaptive policies; Data leakage prevention, the ability to block data exfiltration including the data exposed through Gen AI services. Simply put, Flow is the industry's first and only cloud data runtime security solution. \r\nBut we'll also enhance our native data protection module, which is off to a great start, already replacing legacy DLP products in Fortune 500 accounts. Customer frustration with legacy DLP is at a fever pitch. Similar to the days of legacy AV where outdated products overstayed their welcome. We will now be able to offer a cloud-centric next-gen alternative, addressing a market currently shackled by ineffective legacy vendors estimated to be an $8 billion TAM in CY '28. With Flow, we will have the most comprehensive data protection from code to application to device to cloud focused on stopping breaches. \r\nNext, let's look at identity protection, which surpassed $300 million in ARR, more than doubling year-over-year. Q4 was also a record quarter of net new identity customer adds. With 80% of attacks involving identity vectors, we have made identity protection standard fare for modern cybersecurity because it is already integrated into our single agent. Other vendors attempt to offer identity protection through nonintegrated, afterthought features or simply lack identity protection altogether. Our identity threat detection and response module remains the market's only single-agent solution that stops lateral movement, protects credentials and secures where identities are actually born, active directory. \r\nWins from the quarter include a 7-figure deal with a mega cruise line using a next-gen product that can never be fully deployed. Upgrades and operations were a disaster. When I personally met with them, they were beyond frustrated with being the quality control test bed and tired of too many incidents that slip past their current vendor. Our identity solution delivered in one, not two agents, sets the Falcon platform apart. \r\nAn 8-figure transaction with a major chip manufacturer added identity to their Falcon deployment. Trapped in a large Microsoft ELA, this organization realized Microsoft needed to bring in a start-up to augment its current offering. This piecemeal approach to identity protection created a massive burden of deploying another unproven agent. The customer saw the immediate value of Falcon Identity. Our single agent and single-platform approach reduced their Microsoft dependency. \r\nLastly, let's discuss log-scale next-gen SIEM in inflecting Falcon platform solution. We added record net new next-gen SIEM ARR in Q4 and growing over 170% year-over-year. As of the end of Q4, our next-gen SIEM ending ARR is now greater than $150 million, selected by well over 1,000 customers. \r\nOur next-gen SIEM is quickly emerging as the go-to Splunk alternative for all businesses looking to leave legacy SIEMs. Following M&A consolidation in the legacy SIEM market, and mounting dissatisfaction with a slew of withering SIEMs, the market is hungry for better technology, lower TCO and instant time to value. \r\nIn large-scale next-gen SIEM, all CrowdStrike data is already resident, saving the expense and time of data transfer. Customers are looking to standardize on the right cloud-native data centric platform for actioning their data, where they're manually searching, using automated AI-powered queries or trusting partners to manage their next-gen SIEM Falcon experience. With pipeline already in the hundreds of millions, there's overwhelming interest in LogScale scale next-gen SIEM. \r\nOne of many noteworthy wins from the quarter was in partnership with Deloitte, which has a hypergrowth LogScale next-gen SIEM practice. Together, we closed a 7-figure multiyear next-gen SIEM deal with a large European manufacturer displacing Splunk and Elastic and beating out Azure's Sentinel. This customer now has 16 Falcon platform modules deployed. \r\nA major mobile computing company standardized on LogScale next-gen SIEM in a 7-figure multiyear deal replacing legacy SIEM. We competed against Palo Alto's XSIAM. The customer was looking for an open architecture versus a closed vendor locked-in approach to cybersecurity. The complexity of having to deploy many different Palo Alto products and multiple agents made CrowdStrike an even easier choice. \r\nLastly, a Fortune 500 hospitality brand grew its relationship with us, again, displacing Splunk and Azure Sentinel in a 7-figure deal. In partnership with E&Y and their global LogScale next-gen SIEM practice, this customer grew their SIEM use cases by bringing in security and IT data more than before, retaining that data for years and benefiting from faster searches. \r\nLogScale next-gen SIEM was significantly faster than Azure Sentinel with a substantially lower total cost of operation, which helped drive this win. Our LogScale next-gen SIEM wins illustrate our sticky and growing data gravity with the businesses of all sizes. I can confidently say LogScale next-gen SIEM is one of the fastest-growing SIEM solutions on the market today. \r\nOur pace of innovation has never been faster. We're incredibly excited to announce that Falcon for IT and Charlotte AI are generally available. As our customers look to solve increasingly complex IT challenges across their heterogeneous environments Falcon for IT excitement is palpable. Our customers are also excited about the gen AI productivity gains from Charlotte AI, where over 80% of our beta users believe they will save hours to days of work each week using Charlotte AI. \r\nThe third and final driver of CrowdStrike's growth at scale is our frictionless go-to-market. I'm a big believer that customers don't buy what they don't need and should never be forced to do so. At Falcon, we announced FalconFlex, a flexible licensing model where we enable customers to use the products they want when they want over the course of a multiyear subscription term. FalconFlex drives customer stickiness, enabling larger land and helping us expand with customers adopting more Falcon platform solutions faster. \r\nA recent noteworthy FalconFlex deal was a multimillion dollar transaction with a Fortune 500 technology company that leveraged FalconFlex to go all in with Falcon, consolidating and displacing legacy IT hygiene products, point cloud products and legacy DLP products. The right platform solutions and go-to-market make a partner ecosystem's leading choice. \r\nSome partnership highlights include: accelerating momentum with Dell. Since announcing our Dell partnership last year, we've transacted more than $50 million of total deal value together with customers in every segment and geography. We're in the early innings of where this partnership is going, and I'm thrilled with the momentum that we have with Dell as they standardize new offerings such as their own MDR service on Falcon. \r\nOur MSSP business is growing by triple digits year-over-year, fueled by the right technology, strategy and partners. MSSPs increasingly want the platform, not part of the platform, to power cybersecurity transformation. MSSPs are bringing Falcon to tens of thousands of SMBs who lack the staff and time but still need the outcome of the industry's best cybersecurity. \r\nOur AWS Marketplace business continues to accelerate at scale, surpassing $1 billion in sales the AWS Marketplace continues to be one of the fastest-growing routes to market. A vast majority of our marketplace business also transacts through resellers and SIs, where we've unified partners and cloud marketplaces for ease, speed and end customer value. \r\nThe Falcon platform is validated, tested and certified. Industry analysts regularly recognize Falcon and our leadership. Here are two recent examples. First, the Gartner's EPP Magic Quadrant. Our placement speaks for itself. CrowdStrike's positioning as highest in ability to execute and furthest to the right in completeness of vision in this year's Magic Quadrant solidifies our unequivocal market leadership ahead of Microsoft and every other vendor profile. Second, the Forester wave for cloud security placed CrowdStrike as one of only two leaders in the entire cloud security market, ranking highest for vision and innovation. \r\nIn conclusion, CrowdStrike's single agent, single unified data-centric platform and our mission to stop breaches sets us apart. Since starting the company, we brought cybersecurity to the cloud. We pioneered AI for cybersecurity, and we've quickly become the de facto security platform that disrupts, displaces and consolidates other vendors. I couldn't be more excited about the year we completed as well as our bright future. CrowdStrike's contribution to cybersecurity goes beyond technology. It's the power of the crowd. We are cybersecurity's community. \r\nWhen cybersecurity professionals apply for jobs, CrowdStrike certification is the required skill set. In the reseller and ISV ecosystem, CrowdStrike is at the top of the line card. In SoCs across every vertical and geography, CrowdStrike is the security operating system. It's CrowdStrike that's on the screen. When talking about the threat landscape, CrowdStrike pioneered commercial threat intelligence that governments and companies of all sizes depend on. It's CrowdStrike that delivers billions of new threat detections every month to stop the breach. It's CrowdStrike that is the search bar of security, where analysts complete millions of XDR queries daily. It's CrowdStrike that created cybersecurity's first dedicated Gen AI stock assistant to make every user a power user. It's CrowdStrike where more than 0.5 million cybersecurity defenders log in every day to protect society by stopping breaches. The technology, the crowd, the mission, this is what makes CrowdStrike cybersecurity's definitive platform. \r\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Burt.\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. CrowdStrike delivered an exceptional fourth quarter and a record finish to the year, highlighting our outstanding execution, growing market leadership and accelerating adoption of the Falcon platform. \r\nFor the full fiscal year, we achieved 34% and 36% ending ARR and revenue growth, respectively, while delivering significant leverage on the bottom line. Operating income grew 86% year-over-year to reach a record $660.3 million or 22% of revenue. And net income attributable to CrowdStrike and EPS more than doubled to reach a record $751.8 million or $3.09 per diluted share. \r\nFree cash flow grew 39% year-over-year to reach $938.2 million or 31% of revenue, exceeding our target for the year. Additionally, we are very proud to have achieved the important milestone of GAAP profitability for the past 4 quarters and full fiscal year in less than 5 years following our IPO. \r\nOur achievements in fiscal year 2024 represent another high watermark for CrowdStrike. Through our consistent focus on execution, we have efficiently scaled the business, growing ending ARR by over 10x from our IPO in fiscal year 2019, delivering significant operating leverage and growing our free cash flow margin profile to above 30%. We continue to aggressively invest in our innovation engine and flank the company to achieve its vision of reaching $10 billion in ARR over the next 5 to 7 years. \r\nMoving to the specifics of the fourth quarter, we achieved record net new ARR of $282 million, up 27% off of last year's record Q4, representing our second consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. And we finished the quarter with $3.44 billion in ending ARR, up 34% over last year. Demand in the quarter was broad-based, and we have a record Q1 pipeline as we executed on our platform strategy, closed many large consolidation deals and extended our leadership across the market from large enterprises to small businesses. \r\nWhile companies may be fatigued with other vendors, they have embraced CrowdStrike's platform strategy and want to buy more of the Falcon platform. This is evidenced by, first, the number of deals with 8 or more modules more than doubling year-over-year in Q4. Second, subscription customers where 5 or more, 6 or more and 7 or more modules growing to 64%, 43% and 27% of subscription customers, respectively. Third, the number of customers with greater than $1 million of ending ARR growing to more than 580. And finally, the growth of deals with total value exceeding $1 million accelerated to over 30% and reached an all-time record at over 250 in Q4. \r\nWe finished the year with 29,000 subscription customers which excludes smaller customers served through our MSSP partners. We are landing bigger with new customers on average adopting 4.9 modules out of the gate, an increase over last year. Our gross retention rate remained high at 98%, and our dollar-based net retention rate was consistent with last quarter at 119%, which is slightly below our benchmark as the mix of net new ARR from new customers has remained above our expectations and we continue to land bigger deals. For the interim FY '24 quarters, Net retention was 119% in Q3, 119% in Q2 and 122% in Q1. \r\nLooking into FY '25, a we expect our dollar-based net retention rate to fluctuate within plus or minus a few points of 120% as the business scales to even greater heights and customers continue to land bigger and with more modules. Moving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 33% over Q4 of last year to reach $845.3 million. Subscription revenue grew 33% over Q4 of last year to reach $795.9 million. Professional services revenue was $49.4 million representing 26% year-over-year growth. The geographic mix of fourth quarter revenue consisted of approximately 68% from the U.S., 16% from Europe, Middle East and Africa, 10% from the Asia Pacific region and 6% from all other markets. \r\nTotal gross margin increased by 282 basis points year-over-year to reach 78% and subscription gross margin was above 80% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 291 basis points over the prior year. Our strong gross margin performance was driven by our ability to command stable pricing, supported by the exceptional customer value delivered by the Falcon platform as well as our continued investments in data center and workload optimization. \r\nTotal non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $448.1 million or 53% of revenue compared to 60% of revenue in the prior year. Our strategic investments in talent and innovation underpin our ability to scale the business and deliver profitable growth. \r\nIn the fourth quarter, non-GAAP operating income grew 123% year-over-year to reach a record $213.1 million, and operating margin increased by 10 percentage points year-over-year to reach a record 25%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q4 grew to a record $236.2 million or $0.95 on a diluted per share basis, each more than doubling year-over-year. Our weighted average common shares used to calculate fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS attributable to CrowdStrike was on a diluted basis and totaled approximately 248 million shares. \r\nWe ended the fourth quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments grew to a record $3.47 billion. Cash flow from operations was a record $347.0 million. Free cash flow reached a record $283.0 million or 33% of revenue, achieving a Rule of 66 on a free cash flow basis. \r\nBefore I move to our outlook, I'd like to provide a few modeling notes. First, we are encouraged by the momentum in the business including larger deal sizes, increased win rates and a record Q1 pipeline. However, we continue to maintain a consistent and prudent approach to our outlook amid a macro environment that remains challenging, and therefore, the guidance we are providing today assumes a consistent challenging macro backdrop. \r\nSecond, while we do not specifically guide to ending or net new ARR, given the incredible performance of Q4, I will share our current seasonality assumptions with respect to net new ARR in Q1, which calls for Q1 net new ARR year-over-year growth to be at least double digits up to the low teens. \r\nThird, given our strong momentum in the market, we are increasing our pace of hiring in FY '25 as we continue to invest in our innovation engine and go-to-market functions to scale the business to $10 billion of ARR and beyond. As a result of increased hiring in the first half of the year, changes to the timing of our merit cycle and the timing of certain marketing programs, we expect operating leverage to be more weighted to the back half of FY '25. \r\nNext, we are raising our free cash flow target for FY '25 from between 30% and 32% to between 31% and 33% of revenue. Our assumptions on interest income and expense, CapEx and cash outlay for taxes will be included after this call in our earnings presentation available on our Investor Relations website. \r\nMoving to our outlook. For the first quarter of FY '25, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $902.2 million to $905.8 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 30% to 31%. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $188.1 million to $190.8 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $220.4 million to $223.1 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.89 to $0.90, utilizing a weighted average share count of 248 million shares on a diluted basis. \r\nFor the full fiscal year 2025, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3,924.9 to $3,989.0 million, reflecting a growth rate of 28% to 31% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $863.6 million and $913.0 million. We expect fiscal 2025 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $940.3 million and $989.7 million. Utilizing 250 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $3.77 to $3.97. \r\nGeorge and I will now take your questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nOkay. Great. Congrats to the team on a strong finish to the year. George, maybe for you. I think the number that sticks out the most to me from the quarter is the $850 million in ARR from maybe what I'll call platform products. So the question is, can you just talk about the competitive landscape in a couple of those areas like cloud security and SIEM. I mean, definitely a rising tide in some of those markets, but also some good competitors. What do you think is giving CrowdStrike a right to win in those markets?\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nWell, thanks, Saket. Obviously, a key part of our success has been that all of the modules are platform, which is really a key driver. And when I started the company, it was really about creating this data platform that allowed us to ingest data at scale and then create multiple use cases. And really, what you're seeing is many, many years of hard work that allow us to solve use cases beyond just core endpoint protection. So when we think about cloud security, customers are really looking to rationalize the alphabet soup of cloud products that are out there. And they're looking, not only for posture management, but runtime protection, and they want it all integrated into a data platform. \r\nSo I think given what we've done and some of the acquisitions, including now Flow, we are obviously well positioned in that area and a lot of interest from our customers, and we've seen a lot of success. When we think about the SIEM market and more -- maybe more importantly, the legacy SIEM market, customers are just frustrated with the existing technologies, the cost structure around those. And what they're looking for really is a data platform like CrowdStrike and now that LogScale's natively integrated into the product, it's a better way to give them the outcome they want, which is faster results, better overall outcomes and a lower TCO. So I think it's this data concept that we've been talking about for many years that everyone now is starting to see the fruits of our labor and how we can solve use case well beyond just endpoint protection. Burt?\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nYes. So I would agree, George. I think at the end of the day, for us, when we're thinking about the different products that are in our portfolio. It's really about the platform. We sell the platform regardless of what are the products that are in the platform. They all kind of work off of each other, and we're just out there solving as many outcomes as we possibly can.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brian Essex of JPMorgan.\n\nBrian Lee Essex\n\nGreat to see the strong results from the team. George, you articulated a few thoughts on consolidation and pricing in your prepared remarks. But I wanted to ask a little more directly a maybe follow-up to Saket's question both for you and Burt. One of the other vendors in the space has talked about a strategy of platformization. So maybe with that in context, how does this impact your go-to-market and pricing?\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nWell, thanks, Brian, as you might imagine, I heard a lot about platformization over the last week. To me, it's kind of a made up (inaudible) term. But what I believe our competitors are talking about is bundling discounting and giving products away for free, which is nothing new. In software and security software, it's been done for the last 30 years. So when we think about what we've seen in the past with other competitors. We know free isn't free. And what customers are saying is more consoles, more point products masquerading as platforms create fatigue in their environment. \r\nAnd one of the things, again, that we've been focused on is that single-agent architecture, a single platform, single console that allows us to stop the breach, but more importantly, drive down the operational cost and supply many use cases or solve many use cases that are out there. So I've been around the block for a bit. I've seen this movie of wrap and roll and bundling together with multiple products that were acquired. And last time I saw that, I was at McAfee. So I don't know, Burt, do you have anything to add to that?\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nYes. I think, George, look, at the end of the day, we sell on value. And we've never been a company that's done deep discounting. We've never been a company that has increased our prices to get more ARR. That's not us. And at the end of the day, for us, we're here to help customers get the greatest amount of outcomes at the lowest TCO, period. And to George's point, free is not free and good is not good enough.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Rob Owens of Piper Sandler.\n\nRobbie David Owens\n\nI was wondering if you could address the modest step-up in billings duration. After a year of compressing durations, your total billings outgrew your short-term billings, and it does appear that customers are committing for longer contracts. Wondering if that's a function of your consolidated platform or another dynamic in the market?\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nRob, so I think it's a couple of things. One, for sure, it's about the platform. But second, Q4 is -- historically, we've seen a lot more of the multiyear deals. We also see more renewals in Q4 as well. But billings in general, remember, it's a noisy metric, right? It's heavily influenced by duration and timing of deals within the given quarter. But -- and having said that, at the end of the day, we do manage the business to ARR. And that's the one that we focus in on. Billings for us is just an aftermath. You're right. It was a strong billings quarter, but that's not really how we run the business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein of Truist.\n\nJoel P. Fishbein\n\nCongrats on the great execution as well. George, just a follow-up for you on the data market or the DLP market and congrats on the acquisition of Flow. Just curious how that will be integrated. You didn't really mention how big that is for you guys, but obviously, a very big market that is ripe for disruption. And maybe talk about the competitive dynamics of that market as well.\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nSure. Well, we're excited about this because not only do we get the classification of data, but we also get the runtime protection in the cloud. So it's a perfect fit for our data protection module. And again, what I talked about in the prepared remarks was that there's a lot of similarities to what I saw when I started the company in legacy AV to legacy DLP. I don't even like the term DLP, we call it data protection because It's really about how data flows and data in motion, not only in a company's organization, but through all of their cloud and all of the applications. \r\nSo I think it's a perfect fit. We're excited about the team. We're excited about the technology. That will be integrated, of course, as part of our platform. We spend a lot of time on that, making sure the customer has got the right user experience. And we'll get this closed -- this acquisition closed out in the next couple of weeks and then we'll be heads down with the integration. But so far, so good on our data protection module. We've got some wins there and a tremendous amount of interest in replacing the legacy DLP technologies.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo.\n\nAndrew James Nowinski\n\nIt is a really amazing quarter again, particularly in light of some of the noise that's been in the market. So I wanted to ask about the expanded partnerships with Dell that you announced today and also about the -- I think, the Pax8 partnership that you announced at your user conference last year. I guess, first, how did both partners contribute to results in the quarter relative to your expectations? And then second, have you factored in the contribution from those partners into your FY '25 outlook?\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nYes, I'll take the first part, and I'll turn it over to Burt. So we obviously are very excited about the Dell partnership. I'll start with them. I talked about that earlier. And really, we're in the early innings. We're winning deals, large enterprise all the way down to SMB, taking advantage of their reach and their go-to-market motion. So still early days, and we've already put up some big numbers from that partnership. \r\nWhen we look at Pax8 and the like, again, it's still early days, but we've seen tremendous success, particularly down market in the SMB. And what customers are looking for, even the smaller customers are looking to solve big problems. They can't be hit by ransomware or they can't have an impact to their business. So it's a perfect model for us to get to those SMBs. And it's, like I said, early days, but tremendous results so far. Burt?\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nYes. So I think that -- we're very excited about both partnerships with Dell and Pax8, they represent additional routes to market, but it's still early days on both of them, as George had mentioned. But they're one of many routes to market. We do believe that they're going to bring deals to us, and we're excited to have them on board as partners.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Bank of America.\n\nTal Liani\n\nSo one of -- some of the -- we had discussions this kind of past few weeks about the pricing environment of the XDR market and the ability to offset this with add-on modules. And the question is -- you touched on it, but I want to ask, do you feel -- the contribution of Microsoft and Cortex from Palo Alto and others, do you feel their impact on pricing of individual components off your package? And is the story -- is there a story about price compression of each individual components offset by the bundle or that you just don't see the XDR pricing pressure that Palo Alto was talking about.\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nWell, again, I mean I can -- I try to focus on what we've been able to do. And as the leader in the space, we've been solving problems for a long time. And when we look about -- we look at the impact that ransomware and some of these very prominent breaches have had, you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars for companies. So to buy a platform that has the capabilities to stop breaches is really what customers are looking at. And when we think about sort of one-off modules or things of that nature, for us, we're looking at the total package and the solution of what we put together. \r\nAnd of course, it's a competitive environment, but you have to have a competitive product, you have to have the right level of innovation, and you have to have the right go-to-market motion, which we talked about in some of the prepared remarks. So it has been competitive. It has -- will be competitive. But at the end of the day, what we're finding is that customers want the right outcome. And we've seen that free is not free, and we see that good enough is not good enough. And I think customers are smart enough to realize the difference between price and total cost. And that's what we've been able to show with every dollar spent on CrowdStrike is a $6 return on their investment. And we're going to continue to deliver value and outcomes for customers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson of Needham..\n\nAlexander Henderson\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. So first thing you ever said to me, George, was that you're a platform, not an endpoint company. I think you've been proving it with high alacrity over the last year. \r\nWith the comments coming in about the platformization. It sounds like the response that you're having here is that the companies that are trying to do that are really just offering bundles of products, but they're not truly integrated. Your platform is based off of cloud native micro services, API-driven. And I think if you were to talk to the degree to which you integrate any acquisition into that platform, it would be radically different than what we're hearing or seeing from some of the other players. \r\nSo can you talk about why the micro service cloud-native architecture in a single platform integrated upfront is the way to go and how hard it is for companies that are trying to merge disparate packages into a platform that wasn't designed as a platform from the get-go because I think, ultimately, that's the key differentiator here. And I would think that with the acquisition of Flow, you'll be able to integrate it much more rapidly because it's API-driven, because it's micro service-based. Can you talk to that?\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nYes. Sure, I can. Thanks, Alex. It's a great question. And I do remember our early conversations finally, and you're absolutely right about being the platform for cybersecurity when I started the company. \r\nSo when we think about architecture, architecture does matter and really what we've created is a very data-centric architecture that allows us to get data at scale into our platform, leverage our AI and then create the outcomes. It's that collect once, use many. We have a single platform. Our competitors have many other platforms as they call them. We have a single agent. Our competitors have 5, 6, 7, 8 agents depending on the competitors. \r\nSo when we look at our architecture, it was really designed from the beginning to solve the problems of today and the future problems. And the result of that is ease of use, the outcome that a customer is looking for, stopping breaches and lowering the cost, and future proofing what they want. I've -- in a prior life, I've been involved in companies that acquired a lot of products. And I can tell you, it is near impossible to stitch all this stuff together, particularly at the agent level unless you're very diligent about it. \r\nAnd I can tell you from a CrowdStrike perspective, we've been very diligent about our acquisitions, as you've seen, and thoughtful on the pricing. But also what's important to realize is that we bought products and we really haven't sold some of them for the better part of 18 months because we wanted to focus on the integration, things like identity. And now we see the fruits of our labor. So it's this focused, long-term diligent approach to our acquisitions, I think, that have helped us because we started with a very innovative cloud-native platform from the beginning.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Roger Boyd of UBS.\n\nRoger Foley Boyd\n\nGreat. Congrats on a really strong end of the year. I wanted to talk about Charlotte. The customers that we've spoken to that were part of that early access program sound pretty positive on both what the product can do today as well as the pipeline and where it could go in the future. George, you said a couple of positive stats around automation. Any updated view on your ability to monetize the Charlotte product or the time line to monetization from here?\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nWell, yes, that is the goal. We already have paying customers in Charlotte. We just released it. So the good news for us, and I think the good news for our customers, is they see the value and they're willing to pay for it. Obviously, we're in the early innings of this. But the way we've architected it as a foundational component of our platform, it allows us to create expertise around different areas of the platform as well as automation, leveraging the native automation capabilities that we have. \r\nSo our overall goal, again, is how do you drive automation in the SoC, how do you modernize the SoC, and how do you take the collective wisdom of CrowdStrike and its years of knowledge in fast categories and bring that to bear for customers big and small? And so far, we've gotten the response from customers where they understand the time savings and the value that it can bring. So more to come on this. Obviously, we just GA-ed it over the last week or so. But overall, I'm very encouraged by what we're hearing and seeing from customers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC.\n\nMatthew George Hedberg\n\nI'll offer my congrats as well, guys. Burt, your new ARR commentary was helpful for Q1. I'm curious, this time last year, I believe you talked about flat net new ARR growth for fiscal '24. And obviously, I think you guys did about 6% this year. Any just sort of like directional guardrails you give us from a full year perspective in terms of just thinking about it from a net new perspective?\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nSo with respect to ARR, obviously, we don't guide to it. But we have talked about in the past where we've started the year in Q1 and build from there. And that's kind of really all I can really comment on ARR. You can kind of infer where we're going with our guide. And -- but at the end of the day, our guide -- the methodology has remained consistent, and that's how we think about it.\n\nMatthew George Hedberg\n\nSo it sounds like -- it sounds like your commentary on linearity, you would expect Q1 to be sort of the low point for net new growth -- or net new dollars for the year?\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nYes, That would be accurate.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from the line of John DiFucci of Guggenheim.\n\nJohn Stephen DiFucci\n\nListen, as everybody said, these are really impressive results, no matter how you look at it, but especially as compared to others out there. I'd like to ask another question about the past is -- I know, George, you think, but that's why the past is the past. It's great. It's great to see. But I'd like to ask another question about the future. \r\nI know Charlotte AI is the sexy new product. It's everybody -- are you an AI winner or are you a loser, I mean. And we'll see how that develops. But given your lightweight agent and all the data you collect or even could collect, it just seems that Falcon for IT could be a whole new world for you, which might make it harder given it might perhaps be a different buyer, but certainly worth it. I guess how should we think about the development of this product going forward, given your -- I know it just was generally available too, but I'm sure you've had early conversations with customers.\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nWell, I've got to tell you that the customer excitement around Falcon for IT is off the charts when we talked about it at Falcon and now that it's generally available. Customers are looking for a better solution in this area. And one of the things that we found is that the security team has been solving a lot of IT problems and challenges for IT for a long time, and we really needed to carve out a home for IT. So when you look at some of our competitors in that market, it's -- obviously, it's a pretty big market, but having a single agent and the ability to actually solve IT problems, which many of our customers were doing already, is fantastic. \r\nSo again, early days, but the feedback and the interest is off the charts for Falcon for IT, and it goes to the heart of how we built the platform. To collect data, it doesn't have to be security data. It can be almost any data related to either our agent first-party data or now third-party data we can ingest. And that solves many use cases beyond what we originally came to market with. So I think the sky is the limit there.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to George Kurtz for closing remarks. Sir?\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nSo I want to thank all of you for your time today. We appreciate your interest and certainly look forward to seeing you at our upcoming investor events. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

        "title": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) Soars 24% as Q4 Earnings Crush Estimates",
        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD shares jumped nearly 24% on Tuesday\u2019s extended trading session after the cloud-based cybersecurity solution provider reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results. Fourth-quarter revenues and earnings both witnessed a significant improvement on a year-over-year basis as well.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings increased more than twofold to 95 cents per share from the year-ago quarter\u2019s earnings of 47 cents. Quarterly earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 82 cents and came ahead of management\u2019s previous guidance of 81-82 cents. The robust bottom-line performance was mainly driven by higher revenues and better cost management.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues of $845.3 million rose 33% year over year and surpassed the consensus mark of $839.1 million. The top line was also higher than the company\u2019s earlier guidance of $836.6-$840 million. The strong adoption of the Falcon platform and better sales execution mainly aided top-line growth in the fourth quarter.\n\nCrowdStrike Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nCrowdStrike price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | CrowdStrike Quote\n\nTop Line in Detail\n\nSubscription revenues (94% of the total revenues) jumped 33% year over year to $795.9 million. Professional services revenues (6% of the total revenues) rose 26% year over year to $49.4 million. Our estimates for the Subscription and Professional Services segments were pegged at $788.9 million and $47.8 million, respectively.\n\nAs of Jan 31, 2024, annual recurring revenues (ARR) were $3.44 billion, up 34% year over year. The company added $281.9 million to its net new ARR in the reported quarter. Our fourth-quarter projections for ARR and net new ARR were $3.43 billion and $354 million, respectively.\n\nCrowdStrike ended the quarter with record deal volumes. During the reported quarter, the company closed more than 250 deals greater than $1 million in value, more than 490 deals greater than $500,000 in deal value and more than 1,900 deals greater than $100,000 in deal value.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s subscription customers, who adopted five or more cloud modules, represented 64% of the total subscription customers, those with six or more cloud modules accounted for 43%, and those with seven or more cloud modules represented 27% as of Jan 31, 2024. Deals with eight or more modules doubled on a year-over-year basis. CRWD ended the fourth quarter with more than 29,000 subscription customers, which excludes smaller customers served through managed security service provider partners.\n\nOperating Details\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s non-GAAP gross profit increased 37.6% to $661.2 million in the fourth quarter from $480.6 million in the year-ago quarter. The non-GAAP gross margin improved 300 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 78%. The strong gross margin performance was primarily driven by the company\u2019s ability to command stable pricing, supported by the exceptional customer value delivered by its Falcon platform, as well as its continued investments in data center and workload optimization.\n\nThe non-GAAP subscription gross profit soared 38% year over year to $638.6 million, while the gross margin expanded 300 bps to 80% on a year-over-year basis. The non-GAAP professional gross profit jumped 25% to $22.6 million, while the gross margin remained flat at 46% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 16.4% to $448 million from $385 million in the year-ago quarter. However, as a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses declined to 53% from 60% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nNon-GAAP sales and marketing (S&M) expenses jumped 19.9% year over year to $243.5 million. Non-GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses surged 10.4% year over year to $151.8 million. Non-GAAP general and administrative (G&A) expenses increased 18.6% year over year to $52.7 million. As a percentage of revenues, S&M, R&D and G&A expenses contracted by 300 bps, 400 bps and 100 bps to 29%, 18% and 6%, respectively.\n\nThe non-GAAP operating income surged more than twofold to $213.1 million from $95.6 million in the year-ago quarter, mainly driven by higher revenues. The non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter improved to 25% from 15% in the previous year\u2019s quarter, which primarily benefited from a higher gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.\n\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\n\nAs of Jan 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $3.47 billion. CrowdStrike had a long-term debt of $742.5 million.\n\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, CRWD generated operating and free cash flows of $347 million and $283 million, respectively. In full fiscal 2024, it generated operating and free cash flows of $1.17 billion and $938.2 million, respectively.\n\nGuidance\n\nCrowdStrike initiated guidance for the first quarter and fiscal 2025. For the fiscal first quarter, CrowdStrike anticipates revenues between $902.2 and $905.8 million. The non-GAAP operating income is expected in the band of $188.1-$190.8 million. Non-GAAP net income is forecasted to be in the $220.4-$223.1 million range. For the bottom line, the company expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of 89-90 cents per share.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, CRWD expects revenues between $3,924.9 million and $3,989 million. The non-GAAP operating income for fiscal 2025 is projected in the band of $863.6-$913, while non-GAAP net income is anticipated in the range of $940.3-$989.7 million. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated in the band of $3.77-$3.97 per share.\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nCrowdStrike currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

        "title": "5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "If you bought Nvidia stock years ago and held on to it, you are likely to be significantly wealthier today. This semiconductor stock benefitted greatly from the interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and generated millionaire-making returns, helping the company grow to be worth $2.1 trillion. However, it will be hard for new Nvidia investors to get the same kinds of returns going forward because it is already so large. Investors looking for similar return production will need to dig deeper and find rising stars small enough to multiply in size over the coming years.\n\nTo aid in that search, here are five AI stocks with the potential to make millionaires over the coming decade and beyond:\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nData analytics company Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) builds custom software and AI applications on its Gotham, Apollo, and AIP platforms. The company has a deep relationship with the U.S. government and has been scooping up commercial customers. U.S. commercial bookings grew over 100% year over year in Q4. The company is profitable and has a whopping $3.6 billion in cash against zero debt to keep investing to grow. PLTR Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe company's market cap is $55 billion, small enough that the stock has room to grow multiple times its current size if Palantir becomes the eventual mega-cap technology business investors hope. Palantir still has just 497 customers, leaving lots of room for more over the next decade and beyond.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nModular computer systems company Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) is growing its business grow at triple-digit rates thanks to the surge in demand for data center systems for AI. Supermicro's modular system is popular; management has pointed out that its growth far exceeds that of the broader industry. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang projects there will be a need for up to a trillion dollars of data center spending to accommodate the resource needs of AI. SMCI Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nConsidering Supermicro is still doing under $10 billion in annual sales, that's a considerable pie the company will be able to take a bite of. While the stock has already appreciated so much over the past year, the company is only now being added to the S&P 500 and is still worth just $50 billion today. That leaves room for long-term growth.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Symbotic\n\nRobotics company Symbotic(NASDAQ: SYM) is a game-changer in retail and e-commerce. The company is building proprietary fulfillment systems that efficiently store merchandise and use robotics to pick and fill orders. The company has only deployed 35 systems for nine customers, but mega-retailers like Walmart and Target are among them. The company is also developing fulfillment-as-a-service: rentable systems for third-party customers. SYM Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nHaving customers like Walmart (who rely on efficiency to keep prices low) shows confidence in the performance of these fulfillment systems. Symbotic is a young company but is already generating free cash flow. The company's $23 billion market cap leaves room for investment upside if Symbotic's systems become commonplace in the global economy.\n\n4. CrowdStrike\n\nCybersecurity company CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) has emerged as a leader in next-generation technology, using AI to identify and address threats proactively. The company has expanded beyond endpoint security to grow its addressable market to $100 billion. As you can see below, CrowdStrike is still theoretically very early in its growth journey at less than $3 billion in annual sales. CRWD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nCybersecurity is fragmented and competitive, a mix of next-generation players and older, legacy companies from the industry's early years. CrowdStrike's impressive growth over the past few years signals that the business could continue taking market share, and investors are poised to benefit. It's the most prominent company on this list at $75 billion, but decades of growth could be ahead.\n\n5. UiPath\n\nSoftware automation is still relatively foreign to most companies, but UiPath(NYSE: PATH) could change that. The company's software can observe, learn, and replicate simple computer tasks like filling out forms and organizing data. It's a real-world scenario of automating humans out of simple jobs. Importantly, UiPath is the widely recognized industry leader, according to Gartner. PATH Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe company already generates a lot of cash flow, and the stock market cap is only $13 billion. Automating office work could appeal to many companies worldwide, giving the stock potentially lucrative long-term return potential from its currently modest size.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Maria Riley, vice president of investor relations.\n\nPlease go ahead.\n\nMaria Riley -- Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for your participation today. With me on the call are George Kurtz, president and chief executive officer and co-founder of CrowdStrike; and Burt Podbere, chief financial officer. Before we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives, growth, including projections, and expected performance, including our outlook for the first quarter in fiscal year 2025 and any assumptions for fiscal periods beyond that, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this call.\n\nWhile we believe any forward-looking statements we make are reasonable, actual results could differ materially because the statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including the section titled risk factors in the company's quarterly and annual report. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, excluding revenue, all financial measures disclosed on this call will be non-GAAP.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has\u00a0more than tripled\u00a0the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 26, 2024\n\nA discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures in a reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is currently available in our earnings press release, which may be found on the investor relations website at ir.crowdstrike.com or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC today. With that, I will now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kurtz -- Co-Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us today. CrowdStrike delivered an exceptional fourth quarter that far exceeded our expectations. It was another quarter of records: record net new ARR of $282 million, continuing our acceleration trend, growing 27% year over year; record operating margin of 25%, up 10 percentage points year over year; record free cash flow reaching 33% of revenue; and a free cash flow rule of 66; record GAAP profitability; and record cloud identity and next-gen SIEM ending ARR of greater than $850 million, together more than doubling year over year. These results illustrate CrowdStrike's substantial and widening competitive mode, exceptional business acceleration, and validated market leadership.\n\nBuilding on my founding vision, CrowdStrike is the only single-platform, single-agent technology in cybersecurity that solves use cases well beyond endpoint protection. Falcon is the easiest and fastest cybersecurity technology to deploy. And our single AI-native platform makes vendor consolidation instant, frictionless, and natural. The feedback we receive from customers, prospects, and partners alike is consistent: eagerness to deploy the Falcon platform, ease of adopting more Falcon platform modules, and excitement from continuous innovation with new Falcon capabilities delivered weekly.\n\nLeaving stitched-together point products and PowerPoint platforms behind, CrowdStrike customers realize the benefits of superior outcomes and lower TCO. A recent IDC report echoes this, showcasing $6 of return for every dollar invested in the Falcon platform. That is ROI. Free is never free.\n\nCustomers understand the difference between product pricing and the total lifetime cost of operating inferior technology. Given the Falcon platform's ROI and TCO savings, we believe we will continue to see favorable pricing dynamics. I'm thrilled with our performance, which is a testament to the execution and passion from the very best team in cybersecurity. Unified by our focused mission, we stop breaches.\n\nMy gratitude to all CrowdStrikers on a job well done. Our execution and discipline across the business, coupled with overwhelmingly positive market feedback, gives me strong conviction in our fiscal year 2025 momentum, which Burt will cover in more detail. The current macro environment remains stable and consistent with prior quarters. We expect continued deal scrutiny throughout this coming year.\n\nWe remain focused on operational excellence while delivering market leading growth at scale, assisting organizations of all sizes to consolidate and improve their cybersecurity. In contrast to the macroeconomic backdrop, the state of the threat landscape has never been more elevated. In CrowdStrike's recent 2024 Global Threat Report, we unpack the harsh realities of cyber today. Key findings include, first, attacks are faster than ever.\n\nWhat took adversaries hours has shrunk to minutes and seconds. Attack speeds will only accelerate. Second, the cloud is increasingly under attack. We tracked a 75% increase in cloud intrusion attempts.\n\nThe cloud is today's battleground for cyberattacks. And third, generative AI is an adversary force multiplier. Gen AI puts advanced cybercrime tradecraft in the hands of attackers of all skill levels. Gen AI will dramatically grow the adversary population.\n\nThe Global Threat Report showcases our threat intelligence leadership. We collect trillions of threat signals daily, creating one of the world's largest and fastest-growing cyberthreat datasets. From day one, we've been an AI company, training the industry's most effective and accurate AI models to prevent attacks based upon our data mode. Embedded in the Falcon platform is a virtuous data cycle where we collect cybersecurity's very best threat intelligence data, build and train robust preventative and generative models, and protect CrowdStrike customers with community immunity.\n\nOur team of data science PhDs operate this continuous and real-time process, constantly evolving Falcon's AI foundation to predict adversary activity and stay ahead of threats. Our ever-growing data corpus and unique access to cyber's freshest data at the source, alongside our technology and our human incident response, threat analysts, data science, and engineering expertise, together serve as a structural competitive advantage. Along with AI, cybersecurity is a top priority in my discussions with numerous boards. In today's environment of heightened cyberattacks, the latest SEC breach disclosure regulation only increases the pressure on companies and their boards.\n\nWe regularly assist boards with regulation readiness by bringing cybersecurity from the backroom to the boardroom. This, alongside the severity of the threat landscape, makes effective cybersecurity an increasingly mission-critical necessity. That said, cybersecurity today is a frenetic vendor bizarre. Disjointed point feature copycat products clutter the market, attempting to band-aid symptoms instead of curing the illness.\n\nOS vendors use their market position to create a monoculture of dependence and risk, and in many cases, serve as the breach originator. Even worse, multi-platform hardware vendors evangelize their stitched-together patchwork of point products, masquerading as thinly veiled piecemeal platforms. And what organizations inevitably realize is that vendor lock-in leads to deployment difficulties, skyrocketing costs, and subpar cybersecurity. The outcome is shelfware and sunk costs.\n\nELA and bundling addiction become the only way to coast customers into purchasing nonintegrated point products. It's the organization trapped in these fragmented pseudo platforms, riddled with bolt-on point products, that are the ones suffering from fatigue. In stark juxtaposition, what CrowdStrike customers tell us is that when you build the right single data-centric AI platform, deliver the right frictionless native solutions, and architect the right go-to-market, organizations purchase because they need more, receive more, and understand how cybersecurity transformation saves them time and money. Our deal metrics validate this.\n\nFirst, record deal volumes. In Q4, we closed more than 250 deals greater than 1 million in deal value, more than 490 deals greater than 500,000 in deal value, and more than 1,900 deals greater than 100,000 in deal value. Deal counts grew by more than 30% year over year across all deal segments. Second, record platform adoption.\n\nDeals with eight or more modules more than doubled year over year. And lastly, continued rising win rates. In Q4, we saw steadily rising win rates across the board, validating our technological leadership over the competition. These results are driven by the following: the winning AI platform, the right solutions, and our frictionless go-to-market motion.\n\nLet me begin with our winning AI platform. The secret to cybersecurity's leading platform is our single platform has one console and one agent. It solves an ever expanding set of cybersecurity and IT use cases. Our single platform is open.\n\nOur single platform is data-centric, AI native, and scalable, delivering immediate times of value. Key wins prove the value of the Falcon platform, which makes point product consolidation and vendor replacement a reality. A recent seven-figure win in a Fortune 1000 company highlights how our platform consolidates at scale. Falcon replaced an OS security vendor, a legacy AV vendor, and a next-gen vendor.\n\nWe eliminated multiple Microsoft consoles and multiple agents to a single console, single agent, and single platform of Falcon. Our platform approach organically inspires customers to deploy Falcon Cloud Security as their first CSPM, CIEM, and ASPM solution. An eight-figure multiyear win in a Fortune 100 business, where the Falcon platform displayed five different products, with recent breaches costing them hundreds of millions, it costs too much to keep using ineffective cybersecurity tools. They purchased EDR, next-gen AV, identity, file integrity monitoring, and vulnerability management, reducing the number of agents on their devices by approximately 50%.\n\nWhat used to require five installs is now done with one. There are countless similar stories. Our platform approach makes landing with multiple solutions at once easy and adopting increasing capabilities over time in organic experience. We collect data once and reuse it many times for today's and tomorrow's use cases.\n\nOur application of gen AI makes cybersecurity predictive and accessible for all skill levels. It's all on one platform, one agent, and one integrated workflow. Next, delivering the right solutions. Our market-leading cloud security, identity protection, and next-gen SIEM solutions are in demand because they solve painful customer problems.\n\nThese businesses collectively are more than doubling year over year, each are IPO-able businesses, and each play lead roles in Falcon platform consolidation. I'd like to start with our breakout cloud security solution, where we are setting new records and winning at scale. Our cloud security momentum accelerated in the quarter, with net new ARR growing nearly 200% year over year. At more than $400 million in ending ARR, CrowdStrike is one of the largest cloud security businesses in the market and was recently positioned as a market leader in Forrester's cloud security wave.\n\nHere are a few recent cloud security wins. An eight-figure multi-year win in a hyper-growth AI company. This company's endpoint footprint is in the low thousands. However, with its rapidly expanding cloud estate, this transaction marks our largest inside sales deal of all time.\n\nFalcon Cloud Security protects their LLM development and cloud environment. This customer uses CrowdStrike for CFPM, CIEM, CWP, and ASPM. From the SMB to large enterprises, our sellers and partners win with Falcon Cloud Security. A leading hyperscaler grew its use of Falcon Cloud Security, praising our Linux capabilities.\n\nThis large eight-figure transaction takes us deeper into the account where we're not only on every device but now across large parts of their cloud. The win extends CrowdStrike leadership in securing the world's largest cloud. A global financial services giant replaced their Palo Alto Prisma Cloud products in a large seven-figure deal. The Palo Alto Cloud Security products required separate management consoles and separate agents because cloud security is on a separate Palo Alto platform altogether.\n\nCrowdStrike was able to deliver an expected 70% time reduction in management, as well as more than 5 million in annual staffing cost savings. The patchwork of multi-product, multi-agent, multi-console, separate-platform technologies resulted in visibility gaps, asynchronous alerts, and overall fatigue managing cloud security. Falcon's single platform, with its integrated cloud security components, was a win for the customer. Customers are starting to realize that CSPM doesn't stop the breach.\n\nIt is a compliance and reporting tool. Cloud security has moved beyond CSPM. Customers are increasingly realizing that a holistic suite encompassing runtime protection is the only way to protect from active real-time threats. CrowdStrike built the first native single-agent and agent-less cloud security solution.\n\nWe've taken cloud security beyond CSPM to include CIEM for securing cloud identity; ASPM for locating, controlling, and securing cloud applications; CWP to stop malicious behavior and breaches; and now, we turn to securing the cloud data itself that flows in and out of the cloud. Turning our cloud security focus to data, we're incredibly excited to announce our intended acquisition of Flow Security. Flow stood out as the most unique technology among a sea of early start-ups by delivering the industry's first and only cloud data runtime security solution. Let me explain.\n\nThe majority of companies in cloud data security focus on two things: discovery and classification. Here's where Flow stands apart: runtime data discovery and classification, data is analyzed pre- and post-decryption, enabling precise and instant results; real-time and continuous data visibility, a live view into data risk, not just at rest, but also in motion with LLM-powered adaptive policies; data leakage prevention, the ability to block data exfiltration, including the data exposed through gen AI services. Simply put, Flow is the industry's first and only cloud data runtime security solution. But we'll also enhance our native data protection module, which is off to a great start, already replacing legacy DLP products in Fortune 500 accounts.\n\nCustomer frustration with legacy DLP is at a fever pitch, similar to the days of legacy AV where outdated products overstayed their welcome. We will now be able to offer a cloud-centric, next-gen alternative, addressing a market currently shackled by ineffective legacy vendors estimated to be an $8 billion TAM in CY '28. With Flow, we will have the most comprehensive data protection from code to application, to device to cloud, focused on stopping breaches. Next, let's look at identity protection, which surpassed $300 million in ARR, more than doubling year over year.\n\nQ4 was also a record quarter of net new identity customer ads, with 80% of attacks involving identity vectors. We've made identity protection standard fare for modern cybersecurity because it is already integrated into our single agent. Other vendors attempt to offer identity protection through nonintegrated afterthought features, or simply lack identity protection altogether. Our identity threat detection and response module remains the market's only single-agent solution that stops lateral movement, protects credentials, and secures, where identities are actually born, active directory.\n\nWins from the quarter include a seven-figure deal with a mega cruise line using a next-gen product that can never be fully deployed. Upgrades and operations were a disaster. When I personally met with them, they were beyond frustrated with being the quality control test bed and tired of too many incidents that slipped past their current vendor. Our identity solution delivered in one, not two agents, sets the Falcon platform apart.\n\nAn eight-figure transaction with a major chip manufacturer added identity to their Falcon deployment. Trapped in a large Microsoft ELA, this organization realized Microsoft needed to bring in a start-up to augment its current offering. This piecemeal approach to identity protection created a massive burden of deploying another unproven agent. The customer saw the immediate value of Falcon identity.\n\nOur single-agent and single-platform approach reduced their Microsoft dependency. Lastly, let's discuss LogScale next-gen SIEM, an inflecting Falcon platform solution. We added record net new next-gen SIEM ARR in Q4, growing over 170% year over year. As of the end of Q4, our next-gen SIEM ending ARR is now greater than $150 million, selected by well over 1,000 customers.\n\nOur next-gen SIEM is quickly emerging as the go-to Splunk alternative for all businesses looking to leave legacy SIEMs. Following M&A consolidation in the legacy SIEM market and mounting dissatisfaction with a slew of withering SIEMs, the market is hungry for better technology, lower TCO, and instant time-to-value. In LogScale next-gen SIEM, all CrowdStrike data is already resonant, saving the expense and time of data transfer. Customers are looking to standardize on the right cloud-native data-centric platform for actioning their data, where they're manually searching, using automated AI-powered queries for trusting partners to manage their next-gen SIEM Falcon experience.\n\nWith pipeline already in the hundreds of millions, there's overwhelming interest in LogScale next-gen SIEM. One of many noteworthy wins from the quarter was in partnership with Deloitte, which has a hyper-growth, LogScale next-gen SIEM practice. Together, we closed a seven-figure, multiyear next-gen SIEM deal with a large European manufacturer, displacing Splunk and Elastic, and beating out Azure Sentinel. This customer now has 16 Falcon platform modules deployed.\n\nA major mobile computing company standardized a LogScale next-gen SIEM in a seven-figure multiyear deal, replacing a legacy SIEM. We competed against Palo Alto's XSIAM. The customer was looking for an open architecture versus a closed vendor locked-in approach to cybersecurity. The complexity of having to deploy many different Palo Alto products and multiple agents made CrowdStrike an even easier choice.\n\nLastly, a Fortune 500 hospitality brand grew its relationship with us, again, displacing Splunk and Azure Sentinel in a seven-figure deal. In partnership with E&Y and their global LogScale next-gen SIEM practice, this customer grew their SIEM use cases by bringing in security and IP data more than before, retaining that data for years and benefiting from faster searches. LogScale next-gen SIEM was significantly faster than Azure Sentinel with a substantially lower total cost of operation, which helped drive this win. Our LogScale next-gen SIEM wins illustrate our sticky and growing data gravity within businesses of all sizes.\n\nI can confidently say LogScale next-gen SIEM is one of the fastest-growing SIEM solutions on the market today. Our pace of innovation has never been faster. We're incredibly excited to announce that Falcon for IT and Charlotte AI are generally available. As our customers look to solve increasingly complex IT challenges across their heterogeneous environments, Falcon for IT excitement is palpable.\n\nOur customers are also excited about the gen AI productivity gains from Charlotte AI, where over 80% of our beta users believe they will save hours to days of work each week using Charlotte AI. The third and final driver of CrowdStrike's growth at scale is our frictionless go-to market. I'm a big believer that customers don't buy what they don't need and should never be forced to do so. At Falcon, we announced FalconFlex, a flexible licensing model where we enable customers to use the products they want, when they want, over the course of a multiyear subscription term.\n\nFalconFlex drives customer stickiness, enabling larger lands, and helping us expand with customers adopting more Falcon platform solutions faster. A recent noteworthy FalconFlex deal was a multimillion dollar transaction with a Fortune 500 technology company that leveraged FalconFlex to go all-in with Falcon, consolidating and displacing legacy IT Hygiene products, point cloud products, and legacy DLP products. The right platform, solutions, and go-to-market make us the partner ecosystem's leading choice. Some partnership highlights include accelerating momentum with Dell.\n\nSince announcing our Dell partnership last year, we've transacted more than $50 million of total deal value together with customers in every segment and geography. We're in the early innings of where this partnership is going, and I'm thrilled with the momentum that we have with Dell as they standardize new offerings, such as their own MDR service on Falcon. Our MSSP business is growing by triple digits year over year, fueled by the right technology, strategy, and partners. MSSPs increasingly want the platform, not part of the platform, to power cybersecurity transformation.\n\nMSSPs are bringing Falcon to tens of thousands of SMBs who lack the staff and time but still need the outcome of the industry's best cybersecurity. Our AWS Marketplace business continues to accelerate at scale, surpassing $1 billion in sales. The AWS Marketplace continues to be one of the fastest-growing routes to market. A vast majority of our Marketplace business also transacts through resellers and SIs where we've unified partners and cloud marketplaces for ease, speed, and end customer value.\n\nThe Falcon platform is validated, tested, and certified. Industry analysts regularly recognize Falcon and our leadership. Here are two recent examples. First, the Gartner's EPP Magic Quadrant.\n\nOur placement speaks for itself. CrowdStrike's positioning as highest in ability to execute and furthest to the right in completeness of vision in this year's Magic Quadrant solidifies our unequivocal market leadership, ahead of Microsoft and every other vendor profile. Second, the Forrester Wave for cloud security placed CrowdStrike as one of only two leaders in the entire cloud security market, ranking highest for vision and innovation. In conclusion, CrowdStrike's single-agent, single unified data-centric platform, and our mission to stop breaches set us apart.\n\nSince starting the company, we brought cybersecurity to the cloud, we pioneered AI for cybersecurity, and we've quickly become the de-facto security platform that disrupts, displaces, and consolidates other vendors. I couldn't be more excited about the year we completed, as well as our bright future. CrowdStrike's contribution to cybersecurity goes beyond technology. It's the power of the crowd.\n\nWe're a cybersecurity community. When cybersecurity professionals apply for jobs, CrowdStrike certification is a required skillset. In the reseller and ISV ecosystem, CrowdStrike is at the top of the line card. In SOCs across every vertical and geography, CrowdStrike is the security operating system.\n\nIt's CrowdStrike that's on the screen. When talking about the threat landscape, CrowdStrike pioneered commercial threat intelligence that governments and companies of all sizes depend on. It's CrowdStrike that delivers billions of new threat detections every month to stop the breach. It's CrowdStrike that is the search bar of security, where analysts complete millions of XDR queries daily.\n\nIt's CrowdStrike that created cybersecurity's first dedicated gen AI stock assistant to make every user a power user. It's CrowdStrike where more than half a million cybersecurity defenders log in every day to protect society by stopping breaches. The technology, the crowd, the mission, this is what makes CrowdStrike's cybersecurity definitive platform. With that, I'll turn the call over to Burt.\n\nBurt Podbere -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today, are non-GAAP. CrowdStrike delivered an exceptional fourth quarter and a record finish to the year, highlighting our outstanding execution, growing market leadership, and accelerating adoption of the Falcon platform. For the full fiscal year, we achieved 34% and 36% ending ARR and revenue growth, respectively, while delivering significant leverage on the bottom line.\n\nOperating income grew 86% year over year to reach a record $660.3 million, or 22% of revenue. And net income attributable to CrowdStrike and EPS more than doubled to reach a record $751.8 million, or $3.09 per diluted share. Free cash flow grew 39% year over year to reach $938.2 million, or 31% of revenue, exceeding our target for the year. Additionally, we are very proud to have achieved the important milestone of GAAP profitability for the past four quarters and full fiscal year in less than five years following our IPO.\n\nOur achievements in fiscal year 2024 represent another high watermark for CrowdStrike. Through our consistent focus on execution, we have efficiently scaled the business, growing ending ARR by over 10x from our IPO in fiscal year 2019, delivering significant operating leverage and growing our free cash flow margin profile to above 30%. We continue to aggressively invest in our innovation engine and flight the company to achieve its vision of reaching $10 billion in ARR over the next five to seven years. Moving to the specifics of the fourth quarter, we achieved record net new ARR of $282 million, up 27% off of last year's record Q4, representing our second consecutive quarter of accelerating growth.\n\nAnd we finished the quarter with $3.44 billion in ending ARR, up 34% over last year. Demand in the quarter was broad-based, and we have a record Q1 pipeline as we executed on our platform strategy, closed many large consolidation deals, and extended our leadership across the market from large enterprises to small businesses. While companies may be fatigued with other vendors, they have embraced CrowdStrike's platform strategy and want to buy more of the Falcon platform. This is evidenced by, first, the number of deals with eight or more modules more than doubling year over year in Q4.\n\nSecond, subscription customers were five or more, six or more, and seven or more modules growing to 64%, 43%, and 27% of subscription customers, respectively. Third, the number of customers with greater than $1 million of ending ARR growing to more than 580. And finally, the growth of deals with total value exceeding $1 million accelerated to over 30% and reached an all-time record at over 250 in Q4. We finished the year with 29,000 subscription customers, which excludes smaller customers served through our MSSP partners.\n\nWe are landing bigger with new customers on average adopting 4.9 modules out of the gate, an increase over last year. Our gross retention rate remained high at 98%, and our dollar-based net retention rate was consistent with last quarter at 119%, which is slightly below our benchmark, as the mix of net new ARR from new customers has remained above our expectations and we continue to land bigger deals. For the interim FY '24 quarters, net retention was 119% in Q3, 119% in Q2, and 122% in Q1. Looking into FY '25, we expect our dollar-based net retention rate to fluctuate within plus or minus a few points of 120% as the business scales to even greater heights and customers continue to land bigger and with more modules.\n\nMoving to the P&L, total revenue grew 33% over Q4 of last year to reach $845.3 million. Subscription revenue grew 33% over Q4 of last year to reach $795.9 million. Professional services revenue was $49.4 million, representing 26% year-over-year growth. The geographic mix of fourth quarter revenue consisted of approximately 68% from the U.S.; 16% from Europe, Middle East, and Africa; 10% from the Asia-Pacific region; and 6% from all other markets.\n\nTotal gross margin increased by 282 basis points year over year to reach 78%. And subscription gross margin was above 80% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 291 basis points over the prior year. Our strong gross margin performance was driven by our ability to command stable pricing, supported by the exceptional customer value delivered by the Falcon platform, as well as our continued investments in data center and workload optimization. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $448.1 million, or 53% of revenue, compared to 60% of revenue in the prior year.\n\nOur strategic investments in talent and innovation underpin our ability to scale the business and deliver profitable growth. In the fourth quarter, non-GAAP operating income grew 123% year over year to reach a record $213.1 million. And operating margin increased by 10 percentage points year over year to reach a record 25%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q4 grew to a record $236.2 million, or $0.95 on a diluted per share basis, each more than doubling year over year.\n\nOur weighted average common shares used to calculate fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS attributable to CrowdStrike was on a diluted basis and totaled approximately 248 million shares. We ended the fourth quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments grew to a record $3.47 billion. Cash flow from operations was a record $347.0 million.\n\nFree cash flow reached a record $283.0 million, or 33% of revenue, achieving a rule of 66 on a free cash flow basis. Before I move to our outlook, I'd like to provide a few modeling notes. First, we are encouraged by the momentum in the business, including larger deal sizes, increased win rates, and a record Q1 pipeline. However, we continue to maintain a consistent and prudent approach to our outlook amid a macro environment that remains challenging.\n\nAnd therefore, the guidance we are providing today assumes a consistent, challenging macro back. Second, while we do not specifically guide to ending or net new ARR, given the incredible performance of Q4, I will share our current seasonality assumptions with respect to net new ARR in Q1, which calls for Q1 net new ARR year-over-year growth to be at least double digits up to the low teens. Third, given our strong momentum in the market, we are increasing our pace of hiring in FY '25 as we continue to invest in our innovation engine and go-to-market functions to scale the business to $10 billion of ARR and beyond. As a result of increased hiring in the first half of the year, changes to the timing of our merit cycle and the timing of certain marketing programs, we expect operating leverage to be more weighted to the back half of FY '25.\n\nNext, we are raising our free cash flow target for FY '25 from between 30% and 32% to between 31% and 33% of revenue. Our assumptions on interest, income, and expense, capex and cash outlay for taxes will be included after this call in our earnings presentation available on our investor relations website. Moving to our outlook. For the first quarter of FY '25, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $902.2 to $905.8 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 30% to 31%.\n\nWe expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $188.1 to $190.8 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $220.4 to $223.1 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.89 to $0.90, utilizing a weighted average share count of 248 million shares on a diluted basis. For the full fiscal year 2025, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3,924.9 to $3,989.0 million, reflecting a growth rate of 28% to 31% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $863.6 and $913.0 million.\n\nWe expect fiscal 2025 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $940.3 million and $989.7 million. Utilizing 250 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $3.77 to $3.97. George and I will now take your questions.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your question please, Saket.\n\nSaket Kalia -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\nOK, great. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question here, and congrats to the team on a strong finish to the year.\n\nGeorge Kurtz -- Co-Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Saket.\n\nSaket Kalia -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\nGeorge -- sure thing. George, maybe for you. I think the number that sticks out the most to me from the quarter is the $850 million in ARR from maybe what I'll call platform products. So, the question is, can you just talk about the competitive landscape in a couple of those areas like cloud security and SIEM? I mean, definitely a rising tide in some of those markets, but also some good competitors.\n\nWhat do you think is giving CrowdStrike a right to win in those markets?\n\nGeorge Kurtz -- Co-Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, thanks, Saket. Obviously, a key part of our success has been that all of the modules are platform, which is really key driver. And when I started the company, it was really about creating this data platform that allowed us to ingest data at scale and then create multiple use cases. And really, what you're seeing is many, many years of hard work that allow us to solve use cases beyond just core endpoint protection.\n\nSo, when we think about cloud security, customers are really looking to rationalize the alphabet soup of cloud products that are out there. And they're looking not only for posture management but runtime protection, and they want it all integrated into a data platform. So, I think given what we've done and some of the acquisitions, including now Flow, we are obviously a -- well-positioned in that area and a lot of interest from our customers, and we've seen a lot of success. When we think about the SIEM market and maybe more importantly the legacy SIEM market, customers are just frustrated with the existing technologies, the cost structure around those.\n\nAnd what they're looking for really is a data platform like CrowdStrike and now LogScale natively integrated into the product. It's a better way to give them the outcome they want, which is faster results, better overall outcomes, and a lower TCO. So, I think it's this data concept that we've been talking about for many years that everyone now is starting to see the fruits of our labor and how we can solve use cases well beyond just endpoint protection. Burt?\n\nBurt Podbere -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, so I would agree, George. I think at the end of the day, for us, when we're thinking about, you know, the different products that are in our portfolio, it's really about the platform. We sell the platform, regardless of what are the products that are in the platform. They all kind of work off of each other.\n\nAnd we're just out there solving as many outcomes as we possibly can.\n\nSaket Kalia -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Brian.\n\nBrian Essex -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Good afternoon. Thank you for the question -- for taking the question, and great to see the strong results from the team. George, you articulated a few thoughts on consolidation and pricing in your prepared remarks.\n\nBut I wanted to ask a little more directly and maybe follow up to Saket's question, both for you and Burt, you know, one of the other vendors in the space just talked about a strategy of platformization. So, maybe with that in context, how does this impact your go-to-market and pricing?\n\nGeorge Kurtz -- Co-Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, thanks, Brian. As you might imagine, I heard a lot about platformization over the last week. To me, it's kind of a made-up fugazi term. But what I believe our competitors are talking about is bundling, discounting, and giving products away for free, which is nothing new in software and security software.\n\nIt's been done for the last 30 years. So, when we think about what we've seen in the past with other competitors, we know free isn't free. And what customers are saying is more consoles, more point products masquerading as platforms create fatigue in their environment. And one of the things, again, that we've been focused on is that single-agent architecture, single platform,single console that allows us to stop the breach, but more importantly, drive down the operational cost and supply many use cases -- or solve many use cases that are out there.\n\nSo, I've been around the block for a bit. I've seen this movie of wrap-and-roll and bundling together with multiple products that were acquired. And, you know, last time I saw that I was at McAfee. So, I don't know, Burt, you have anything to add to that?\n\nBurt Podbere -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. I think, George, look, at the end of the day, we sell on value. And we've never been a company that's done deep discounting. We've never been a company that has increased our prices to get more ARR.\n\nThat's not us. And at the end of the day for us, you know, we're here to help customers get the greatest amount of outcomes at the lowest TCO. Period. And to George's point, free is not free, and good is not good enough.\n\nBrian Essex -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nThanks, Burt.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead, Rob.\n\nRob Owens -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\n\nYeah, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could address the modest step-up in billings duration. After a year of compressing durations, your total billings outgrew your short-term billings. And it does appear that customers are committing for longer contracts.\n\nI'm wondering if that's a function of your consolidated platform or another dynamic in the market? Thanks.\n\nBurt Podbere -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nSo, hey, Rob, so I think it's a couple of things. One, for sure it's about the platform. But second, Q4 is, historically, we've seen a lot more of the multiyear deals. We also see more renewals in Q4 as well.\n\nBut billings in general, remember, it's a noisy metric, right? It's heavily influenced by duration and timing of deals within the given quarter. But -- and having said that, at the end of the day we do manage the business to ARR. And that's the one that we focus in on. Billings for us is just an aftermath.\n\nYou're right, it was a strong billing quarter, but that that's not really how we run the business\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein of Truist. Please go ahead, Joel.\n\nJoel Fishbein -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\n\nThank you, and congrats on the great execution as well. George, just a follow-up for you on the data market or the DLP market, and congrats on the acquisition of Flow. Just curious how that will be integrated. You didn't really mention how big that is for you guys, but obviously, a very big market that is right for disruption.\n\nAnd maybe talk about the competitive dynamics of that market as well.\n\nGeorge Kurtz -- Co-Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nSure, well, we're excited about this because not only do we get the classification of data, but we also get the runtime protection in the cloud, so it's a perfect fit for our data protection module. And again, what I talked about in prepared remarks was that there's a lot of similarities to what I saw when I started the company in legacy AV to legacy DLP. I don't even like the term DLP. We call it data protection because it's really about how data flows and data in motion, not only in a company's organization, but through all of their cloud and all of the applications.\n\nSo, I think it's a perfect fit. We're excited about the team. We're excited about the technology. That will be integrated, of course, as part of our platform.\n\nWe spent a lot of time on that, making sure the customer's got the right user experience. And, you know, we'll get this acquisition closed out in the next couple of weeks, and then we'll be heads down with the integration. But so far so good on our data protection module. We've got some wins there and a tremendous amount of interest in replacing the legacy DLP technologies.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your question, please, Andrew.\n\nAndy Nowinski -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\nThank you for taking the question. It was just a really amazing quarter again, particularly in light of some of the noise that's been in the market. So, I wanted to ask about the expanded partnerships with Dell that you announced today, and also about the, I think, the Pax8 partnership that you announced at your user conference last year. I guess, first, how did both partners contribute to results in the quarter relative to your expectations? And then, second, have you factored in a contribution from those partners into your FY '25 outlook?\n\nGeorge Kurtz -- Co-Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah, I'll take the first part, and I'll turn it over to Burt. So, we obviously are very excited about the Dell partnership. I'll start with them. I talked about that earlier.\n\nAnd really, we're in the early innings. We're winning deals, large enterprise all the way down to SMB, taking advantage of their reach and their go-to-market motion. So, still early days, and we've already put up some big numbers from that partnership. When we look at Pax8 and the like, again, it's still early days, but we've seen tremendous success, particularly down market in the SMB.\n\nAnd what customers are looking for, even the smaller customers are looking to solve big problems. They can't be hit by ransomware. They can't have an impact to their business. So, it's a perfect model for us to get to those SMBs and, you know, it's like I said, early days but tremendous results so far.\n\nBurt?\n\nBurt Podbere -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. So, I think that we're very excited about both the partnerships, both Dell and Pax8. They represent, you know, additional routes to market, but it's still early days on both of them, as George had mentioned. But they're one of many routes to market.\n\nWe do believe that they're going to bring deals to us, and we're excited to have them on board as partners.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Bank of America. Please go ahead, Tal.\n\nTal Liani -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nHi, guys. So, we had discussions this past few weeks about the pricing environment of the XDR market and the ability to offset this with add-on modules. And the question is, you touched on it, but I want to ask, do you feel the contribution of Microsoft and Cortex from Palo Alto and others, do you feel their impact on pricing of individual components of your package? And is there a story about price compression of each individual component offset by the bundle, or that you just don't see the XDR pricing pressure that Palo Alto was talking about?\n\nGeorge Kurtz -- Co-Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, again, I mean, I can -- I try to focus on what we've been able to do. And as the leader in the space, we've been solving problems for a long time. And when we look about -- we look at the impact that ransomware and some of these very prominent breaches have had, you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars for companies. So, to buy a platform that has the capability to stop breaches is really what customers are looking at.\n\nAnd when we think about sort of one-off modules or things of that nature, you know, for us, we're looking at the total package and the solution of what we put together. And of course, it's a competitive environment, but you have to have a competitive product, you have to have the right level of innovation, and you have to have the right go-to-market motion, which we talked about in some of the prepared remarks. So, it has been competitive. It will be competitive.\n\nBut at the end of the day, what we're finding is that customers want the right outcome. And we've seen the free is not free, and we see that good enough is not good enough. And I think customers are smart enough to realize the difference between price and total cost. And that's what we've been able to show with every dollar spent on CrowdStrike is a $6 return on their investment.\n\nAnd, you know, we're going to continue to deliver value and outcomes for customers.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson of Needham. Please go ahead, Alex.\n\nAlex Henderson -- Needham and Company -- Analyst\n\nGreat, thank you so much. So, first thing you ever said to me, George, was that you're a platform, not an endpoint company. I think you've been proving it, you know, with high alacrity over the last year. With the conference coming in about platformization, it sounds like the response that you're having here is that the companies that are trying to do that are really just offering bundles of products, but they're not truly integrated.\n\nYour platform is based on cloud-native microservices, API-driven. And I think if you were to talk to the degree to which you integrate any acquisition into that platform, it would be radically different than what we're hearing or seeing from some of the other players. So, can you talk about why the microservice cloud-native architecture in a single platform integrated upfront is the way to go and how hard it is for companies that are trying to merge disparate packages into a platform that wasn't designed as a platform from the get-go? Because I think, ultimately, that's the key differentiator here. And I would think that with the acquisition of Flow, you'll be able to integrate it much more rapidly because it's API-driven, because it's microservice-based.\n\nCan you talk to that?\n\nGeorge Kurtz -- Co-Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah, sure I can. Thanks, Alex. It's a great question. And I do remember our early conversation, finally, and you're absolutely right about being the platform for cybersecurity when I started the company.\n\nSo, when we think about architecture, architecture does matter. And really, what we've created is a very data-centric architecture that allows us to get data at scale into our platform, leverage our AI, and then create the outcomes. It's that collect once, reuse many. We have a single platform.\n\nOur competitors have many other platforms, as they call them. We have a single agent. Our competitors, you know, have five, six, seven, eight, eight, depending on the competitor. So, when we look at our architecture, it was really designed from the beginning to solve the problems of today and the future problems.\n\nAnd the result of that is ease of use, the outcome that a customer is looking for, stopping breaches and lowering the cost, and future-proofing what they want. I've -- in a prior life, you know, I've been involved in companies that acquired a lot of products. And I can tell you, it is near impossible to stitch all this stuff together, particularly at the agent level, unless you're very diligent about it. And I can tell you from a CrowdStrike perspective, we've been very diligent about our acquisitions, as you've seen, and thoughtful on the pricing.\n\nBut also, what's important to realize is that we've bought products, and we really haven't sold some of them for the better part of 18 months because we wanted to focus on the integration, things like identity. And now we see the fruits of our labor. So, it's this focused, long-term, diligent approach to our acquisitions, I think, that have helped us because we started with a very innovative cloud-native platform from the beginning.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Boyd of UBS. Please go ahead, Roger.\n\nRoger Boyd -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. And again, congrats on a really strong end of the year. I wanted to talk about Charlotte.\n\nThe customers that we've spoken to that were part of that early access program sound pretty positive on both what the product can do today, as well as the pipeline and where it could go in the future. George, you said a couple of positive stats around automation. Any updated view on your ability to monetize the Charlotte product or the timeline to monetization from here? Thanks.\n\nGeorge Kurtz -- Co-Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, yeah, that is the goal. We already have paying customers in Charlotte, and we just released it. So, the good news for us, and I think the good news for our customers, is they see the value and they're willing to pay for it. Obviously, you know, we're in the early innings of this.\n\nBut the way we've architected it as a foundational component of our platform, it allows us to create expertise around different areas of the platform, as well as automation, leveraging the native automation capabilities that we have. So, our overall goal again is, how do you drive automation in a SOC? How do you modernize a SOC? And how do you take the collective wisdom of CrowdStrike and its years of knowledge in vast categories and bring that to bear for customers, big and small? And so far, we've gotten the response from customers where they understand the time savings and the value that it can bring. So, more to come on this. Obviously, we just [Inaudible] it over the last week or so.\n\nBut overall, I'm very encouraged by what we're hearing and seeing from customers.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC. Please go ahead, Matt.\n\nMatt Hedberg -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nGreat, thanks for taking my question. I'll offer my congrats as well, guys. Burt, your ARR -- your net new ARR commentary was helpful for Q1. I'm curious, this time last year, I believe you talked about flat net new ARR growth for fiscal '24.\n\nAnd obviously, I think you guys did about 6% this year. Any just sort of like directional guardrails you could give us from a full year perspective in terms of -- you know, sort of what you're thinking about from a net new perspective?\n\nBurt Podbere -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nHey, Matt. Thanks. So, with respect to ARR, obviously, we don't guide to it, but we have talked about in the past where we've, you know, started the year in Q1 and built from there. And that's kind of really all I can really comment on, on ARR.\n\nYou can kind of infer where we're going with our guide. But at the end of the day, our guide, the methodology has remained consistent. And that's how we think about it.\n\nMatt Hedberg -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nSo, it sounds like Q1 -- it sounds like your commentary on linearity, you'd expect Q1 to be sort of the low point for net new growth -- or net new dollars per year?\n\nBurt Podbere -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, that would be accurate.\n\nMatt Hedberg -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nExcellent, thanks guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks very much. Our next question -- actually, pardon me, our last question comes from the line of John DiFucci of Guggenheim. Please go ahead, John.\n\nJohn DiFucci -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst\n\nThanks. Thank you for taking my question. Listen, guys, as everybody said, these are really impressive results no matter how you look at it, but especially as compared to others out there. I'd like to ask another question about, you know, the past is, I know, George, you think that the past is the past.\n\nIt's great. It's great to see. But I'd like to ask another question about the future. I know Charlotte AI is the sexy new product.\n\nIt's everybody, are you an AI winner or are you a loser? I mean -- and we'll see how that develops. But given your lightweight agent and all the data you collect or even could collect, it just seems that Falcon for IT could be a whole new world for you, which might make it harder, given it might, perhaps, be a different buyer but certainly worth it. I guess, how should we think about the development of this product going forward, given your -- you know, I know it just was generally available, too, but I'm sure you've had early conversations with customers.\n\nGeorge Kurtz -- Co-Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, I've got to tell you that the customer excitement around Falcon for IT is off the charts when we talked about it at Falcon and now that it's generally available. Customers are looking for a better solution in this area. And one of the things that we found is that the security team has been solving a lot of IT problems and challenges for IT for a long time. And we really needed to carve out a home for IT.\n\nSo, when you look at some of our competitors in that market, it's -- you know, obviously it's a pretty big market. But having a single agent and the ability to actually solve IT problems, which many of our customers were doing already, is fantastic. So, again, early days, but the feedback and the interest is off the charts for Falcon for IT. And it goes to the heart of how we built the platform.\n\nTo collect data, it doesn't have to be security data. It can be almost any data related to either our agent first-party data, or now third-party data we can ingest. And that solves many use cases beyond what we originally came to market with. So, I think the sky's the limit there.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to George Kurtz for closing remarks. Sir?\n\nGeorge Kurtz -- Co-Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo, I want to thank all of you for your time today.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. gave a forecast for revenue and profit in the current quarter that far surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectations, crediting a single-platform strategy that has allowed it to gain market share.

It sees revenue of $902.2 million to $905.8 million, also surpassing estimates.\n\nThe Austin, Texas-based company\u2019s earnings beat comes at a time of extreme volatility for cybersecurity stocks. High-profile cybersecurity attacks have created new demand opportunities for some security firms while others have largely missed out. In stark contrast to CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks Inc. plunged in February after cutting its revenue forecast for the year, saying customers were facing cybersecurity \u201cspending fatigue.\u201d\n\nCrowdStrike shares surged as much as 25% in premarket trading on Wednesday before exchanges opened in New York, setting the shares up for the biggest gain since at least March 2020 if the move holds. Other cybersecurity companies including SentinelOne Inc., Fortinet Inc. and Palo Alto Networks also gained.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, CrowdStrike reported adjusted earnings of 95 cents a share, beating estimates of 83 cents. Quarterly revenue also exceeded estimates, hitting $845.3 million.\n\nChief Executive Officer George Kurtz credited the \u201cexceptionally strong\u201d results to the company\u2019s strategy of offering its security products on a single platform. Unlike rival Palo Alto, he said, CrowdStrike\u2019s products are \u201call on one platform, one agent and one integrated workflow.\u201d Kurtz noted on a call with investors that an unnamed financial services firm had replaced its Palo Alto cloud products \u201cin a large seven-figure deal.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike also announced that it had agreed to buy Flow Security, a firm that runs a cloud-data protection platform.\n\n(Updates with premarket trading in fourth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace Immigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market\u2019s Need for Workers Private Equity\u2019s Green Star Started It All With a Database Why Elon Musk Has It In for Sam Altman The Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace Doors\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nCrowdStrike shares have added about 22.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.6%.\n\nWhat's Next for CrowdStrike?\n\nWhile CrowdStrike has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for CrowdStrike: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.80 on $897.83 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.65 on $3.91 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Software is currently in the top 20% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nZeroFox Holdings, Inc. (ZFOX), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2024.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.06 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +57.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nZeroFox Holdings, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $56.95 million, up 25.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) Posts Q4 Sales In Line With Estimates, Stock Jumps 16.8%\n\nCybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) reported results in line with analysts' expectations in Q4 FY2024, with revenue up 32.6% year on year to $845.3 million. The company expects next quarter's revenue to be around $904 million, in line with analysts' estimates. It made a non-GAAP profit of $0.95 per share, improving from its profit of $0.47 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Q4 FY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $845.3 million vs analyst estimates of $840 million (small beat) ARR: $3.44 billion vs analyst estimates of $3.40 billion (1.2% beat) Operating Profit (non-GAAP): $213.1 million vs analyst estimates of $187.8 million (13.5% beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $0.95 vs analyst estimates of $0.82 (15.3% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q1 2025 is $904 million at the midpoint, slightly above what analysts were expecting (non-GAAP EPS guidance for the period more convincingly ahead) Management's revenue guidance for the upcoming financial year 2025 is $3.96 billion at the midpoint, slightly above analyst expectations and implying 29.5% growth (vs 36.7% in FY2024) (non-GAAP EPS guidance for the period more convincingly ahead) Free Cash Flow of $283 million, up 18.4% from the previous quarter Gross Margin (GAAP): 75.3%, up from 72.4% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $75.36 billion\n\n\"CrowdStrike delivered an exceptionally strong and record fourth quarter with net new ARR growth accelerating to 27% year-over-year, reaching a new high of $282 million and ending ARR growing 34% year-over-year to reach $3.44 billion,\u201d said George Kurtz, CrowdStrike's president, chief executive officer and co-founder.\n\nFounded by George Kurtz, the former CTO of the antivirus company McAfee, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) provides cybersecurity software that protects companies from breaches and helps them detect and respond to cyber attacks.\n\nStory continues\n\nEndpoint Security\n\nAlmost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks. As the volume of internet enabled devices grows, every device that employees use to connect to business networks represents a potential risk. Endpoint security software enables businesses to protect devices (endpoints) that employees use for work purposes either on a network or in the cloud from cyber threats.\n\nSales Growth\n\nAs you can see below, CrowdStrike's revenue growth has been impressive over the last two years, growing from $431 million in Q4 FY2022 to $845.3 million this quarter. CrowdStrike Total Revenue\n\nUnsurprisingly, this was another great quarter for CrowdStrike with revenue up 32.6% year on year. On top of that, its revenue increased $59.32 million quarter on quarter, a solid improvement from the $54.39 million increase in Q3 2024. This is a sign of slight re-acceleration of growth.\n\nNext quarter's guidance suggests that CrowdStrike is expecting revenue to grow 30.5% year on year to $904 million, slowing down from the 42% year-on-year increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. For the upcoming financial year, management expects revenue to be $3.96 billion at the midpoint, growing 29.5% year on year compared to the 36.3% increase in FY2024.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares. Click here to claim your Special Free Report on a fallen angel growth story that is already recovering from a setback.\n\nCash Is King\n\nIf you've followed StockStory for a while, you know that we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can't use accounting profits to pay the bills. CrowdStrike's free cash flow came in at $283 million in Q4, up 35.1% year on year. CrowdStrike Free Cash Flow\n\nCrowdStrike has generated $938.2 million in free cash flow over the last 12 months, an eye-popping 30.7% of revenue. This robust FCF margin stems from its asset-lite business model, scale advantages, and strong competitive positioning, giving it the option to return capital to shareholders or reinvest in its business while maintaining a healthy cash balance.\n\nKey Takeaways from CrowdStrike's Q4 Results\n\nThis was a strong quarter for CrowdStrike, with the company beating slightly on revenue and ARR but very convincingly on operating profit. Keeping with that theme, while forward guidance for next quarter and the full year were only slightly above expectations, non-GAAP EPS guidance was more convincingly ahead, showing better-than-expected profitability. Lastly, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) warned of weakness in security spending a few weeks ago when it reported earnings, sending waves of caution across the sector. Cybersecurity peers that reported after Palo Alto put up mixed results, which kept investors on edge for CrowdStrike's results. The stock is up 16.5% after reporting and currently trades at $347 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in CrowdStrike right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

The tax costs for intellectual property integration relating to acquisitions are included in the GAAP provision for income taxes. The income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles assets, including purchased patents, acquisition related expenses, amortization of debt issuance costs and discount, gains and other income from strategic investments attributable to CrowdStrike and legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits included in the GAAP provision for income taxes were not material for all periods presented. (2) For periods in which we had diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders, the sum of the impact of individual reconciling items may not total to diluted Non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders because of rounding differences or because the basic share counts used to calculate GAAP net loss per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders differ from the diluted share counts used to calculate non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders. The GAAP net loss per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders calculation uses a lower share count as it excludes dilutive shares which are included in calculating the non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders.\n\nCROWDSTRIKE HOLDINGS, INC.

CrowdStrike uses the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. CrowdStrike believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as these measures eliminate the effects of certain variables unrelated to CrowdStrike\u2019s overall operating performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nOther companies, including companies in CrowdStrike\u2019s industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of CrowdStrike\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.\n\nInvestors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate CrowdStrike\u2019s business.\n\nNon-GAAP Subscription Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Subscription Gross Margin\n\nCrowdStrike defines non-GAAP subscription gross profit and non-GAAP subscription gross margin as GAAP subscription gross profit and GAAP subscription gross margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense, and amortization of acquired intangible assets.\n\nNon-GAAP Income from Operations\n\nCrowdStrike defines non-GAAP income from operations as GAAP income (loss) from operations excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets (including purchased patents), acquisition-related expenses (credits), mark-to-market adjustments on deferred compensation liabilities, and legal reserve and settlement charges.\n\nNon-GAAP Net Income Attributable to CrowdStrike\n\nThe company defines non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to CrowdStrike excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets (including purchased patents), acquisition-related expenses (credits), net, amortization of debt issuance costs and discount, mark-to-market adjustments on deferred compensation liabilities, legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits, acquisition-related provision (benefit) for income taxes, losses (gains) and other income from strategic investments, and losses (gains) on deferred compensation assets.\n\nNon-GAAP Net Income per Share Attributable to CrowdStrike Common Stockholders, Diluted\n\nCrowdStrike defines non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders, as non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike divided by the weighted-average shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that CrowdStrike defines as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, capitalized internal-use software and website development costs, and purchases of deferred compensation investments. CrowdStrike monitors free cash flow as one measure of its overall business performance, which enables CrowdStrike to analyze its future performance without the effects of non-cash items and allow CrowdStrike to better understand the cash needs of its business. While CrowdStrike believes that free cash flow is useful in evaluating its business, free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, net cash provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP. The utility of free cash flow as a measure of CrowdStrike\u2019s liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in CrowdStrike\u2019s cash balance for any given period. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate free cash flow differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison.\n\nExplanation of Operational Measures\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\n\nARR is calculated as the annualized value of CrowdStrike\u2019s customer subscription contracts as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms. To the extent that CrowdStrike is negotiating a renewal with a customer after the expiration of the subscription, CrowdStrike continues to include that revenue in ARR if CrowdStrike is actively in discussion with such an organization for a new subscription or renewal, or until such organization notifies CrowdStrike that it is not renewing its subscription.\n\nMagic Number\n\nMagic Number is calculated by performing the following calculation for the most recent four quarters and taking the average: annualizing the difference between a quarter\u2019s Subscription Revenue and the prior quarter\u2019s Subscription Revenue, and then dividing the resulting number by the previous quarter\u2019s Non-GAAP Sales & Marketing Expense. Magic Number = Average of previous four quarters: ((Quarter Subscription Revenue \u2013 Prior Quarter Subscription Revenue) x 4) / Prior Quarter Non-GAAP Sales & Marketing Expense.\n\nFree Cash Flow Rule of 40\n\nFree cash flow rule of 40 is calculated by taking the current quarter total revenue year-over-year growth rate percentage and summing it with the current quarter free cash flow margin percentage.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240305166829/en/\n\nContacts\n\nInvestor Relations Contact \r\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\r\nMaria Riley, Vice President of Investor Relations\r\ninvestors@crowdstrike.com \r\n669-721-0742\r\n\r\nPress Contact \r\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\r\nKevin Benacci, Sr. Director, Corporate Communications\r\npress@crowdstrike.com \r\n216-409-5055",

        "content": "Why CrowdStrike (CRWD) Shares Are Getting Obliterated Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) fell 6.8% in the afternoon session after stocks declined, with investors likely taking profits. The Nasdaq fell 1.6%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.9%. Some of the big tech names felt the heat, with Tesla, Netflix, and Microsoft all declining by more than 2%. Notably, iPhone manufacturer Apple was also down nearly 3% following a research report by Counterpoint that suggested a decline in iPhone sales in China in the first six weeks of the year. The weak demand report could signal that the purchasing power of consumers in the region is weakening. Otherwise, we have found no other fundamental or rate-related reasons explaining the broad market decline.\n\nIt is a week packed with information for investors to digest. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will give updates to Congress on March 6th and 7th, 2024, about the current monetary outlook, recent policy actions, and progress toward bringing inflation back down. Finally, on March 8th, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report nonfarm payrolls for the month of February. The insight gleaned from the economic data and updates during the week could inform the market's outlook on equities and other assets for better or worse. Investors expect the Fed to begin cutting rates this year, with the expectation of the first rate cut as early as the first half of the year.\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nCrowdStrike's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 16 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 12 days ago, when the company gained 5.8% as chip and AI stocks surged alongside broader market gains, with the Nasdaq rising by 2.1%, the S&P 500 by 1.5%, and the Dow gaining 0.57% following Nvidia's outstanding earnings results.\n\nDuring its Q4'2024 earnings, Nvidia reported impressive topline results (7.6% revenue beat), big gross margin improvement, and EPS outperformance vs. Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue grew 265% year-on-year and 22% sequentially during the quarter. The strong topline performance was mostly driven by the data center segment, which was up 409% year-over-year and 27% sequentially as demand for Nvidia processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs (large language models), and other AI workloads continued to accelerate. The company estimated that roughly 40% of Data Center revenue was driven by AI-related applications. Guidance for the next quarter was also good, with revenue, gross margin, and implied operating profit coming in ahead of expectations. Overall, Nvidia's strong performance during the quarter highlighted the growing demand for AI-related technology and demonstrated the abundant growth opportunity for innovators within the space.\n\nCrowdStrike is up 18.3% since the beginning of the year, but at $291.93 per share it is still trading 12.7% below its 52-week high of $334.55 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike's shares at the IPO in June 2019 would now be looking at an investment worth $5,034.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Growth Stocks to Buy if There's a Stock Market Sell-Off",
        "content": "Many investors wonder when a sell-off might occur with the market continually notching new highs. While I don't think it's in the cards just yet, it's good to be prepared if there is one.\n\nThis makes it easy to act when the market is falling, allowing you to quickly make decisions instead of needing to analyze. If there's a market sell-off, I'm buying these three stocks first.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nFirst off is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), one of the hottest stocks in the market. Nvidia's GPUs (graphics processing units) are best in class for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, which has caused the company to grow dramatically over the past year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ending Jan. 28) alone, its revenue rose 265% year over year to $22.1 billion.\n\nBut the stock is pricey, trading at around 33 times forward earnings. So, if there's a market sell-off, there's a good chance this premium comes down. That would open the door for me to purchase the stock, as I've missed out on most of its performance.\n\nNvidia is operating in a massive market, with the global GPU market opportunity expected to reach $400 billion by 2032. So, while Nvidia would likely get hit hard in a sell-off, it will be fine over the long term.\n\n2. CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) is not only my favorite cybersecurity stock, but it's the market's favorite as well. This has caused CrowdStrike's stock to become inflated, trading at 27 times sales. CRWD PS Ratio Chart\n\nIf CrowdStrike could snap its fingers and become instantly profitable with a 30% profit margin, it would trade at 90 times earnings. That's more expensive than Nvidia, even from a hypothetical standpoint.\n\nCrowdStrike also has a massive market opportunity estimated at about $225 billion by 2028. With its annual recurring revenue rate rising 35% to $3.15 billion in Q3 FY 2024 (ending Oct. 31), it has a long way to go before saturating its market.\n\nI'm a huge fan of CrowdStrike as a business, but it's not a great buy at this price, so I'll wait until a sell-off occurs.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Costco\n\nSticking with the trend of great companies at expensive prices, Costco (NASDAQ: COST) fits this category. It's also a completely different investment style than the other two, being a commerce store.\n\nCostco has been a market-crushing investment for some time, thanks to its strong execution. Costco isn't going to light the world on fire with amazing growth, but it will consistently grow its earnings at a pace greater than 10% over the long term. COST EPS Basic (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nBy growing its earnings faster than the 10% threshold, Costco is well positioned to beat the market. But at 51 times trailing earning and 48 times forward earnings, it's unbelievably expensive and trades far above where it normally does. COST PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nIf Costco comes back down in a market pullback, I'll be sure to add more shares to my portfolio. Until then, I'll hold off because it's just too expensive to consider buying now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL is leaving no stone unturned to bolster its presence in the automobile sector on the back of robust AI capabilities for Android Auto.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the company announced the wide availability of its AI message summarizing feature on the newest version of Android Auto.\r\n\r\nThis feature is applicable for messages with a minimum of 40-word limit, allowing AI to automatically summarize longer texts or busy group chats while driving. This provides users with a quick and easy way to stay updated on unread messages.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is expected to gain significant popularity among car owners using the Android platform on the back of its latest move.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the AI message summarizing feature is in sync with Alphabet\u2019s continued efforts to enhance its product and service offerings with the power of AI, which, in turn, will likely strengthen its presence in the booming global AI market space. Per a Fortune Business Insights report, the global AI market size is expected to reach $2.02 trillion by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 21.6% between 2023 and 2030.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGrowing Android Auto Initiatives\n\nApart from the AI message summarizing feature, Google Maps on Android Auto now displays 3D buildings while driving, a feature that is enabled by default. The feature can be turned off in Google Maps settings. However, 3D buildings only appear when Android Auto is in light mode and disappear when the UI switches to dark mode.\r\n\r\nFurther, Google's MyRadar, a radar-first weather app, is now available on Android Auto, offering hyperlocal forecasts, push notifications and Wear OS support. MyRadar's \"RouteCast\" feature provides alerts and forecasts for the weather along your car's route, offering valuable weather insights for drivers.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors will aid Alphabet in capitalizing on growth opportunities present in the promising automotive infotainment market. Per a Grand View Research report, the global automotive infotainment market is expected to witness a CAGR of 9.9% between 2024 and 2030.\r\n\r\nWe note that the company\u2019s increasing efforts to bolster its Android Auto portfolio will expand its Android offerings. This, in turn, will boost its Google Services segment, which remains the key growth catalyst for Alphabet. Its shares have rallied 44.2% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 46.8%.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $286.52 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are CrowdStrike CRWD, Badger Meter BMI and AMETEK AME.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Help Make You a Fortune",
        "content": "\"Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders.\" -- Warren Buffett, from the 2022 Berkshire Hathaway letter to shareholders\n\nOne big winner can make a fortune. No one knows this better than the Oracle of Omaha.\n\nTake Apple, one of Buffett's most famous investments. A $50,000 investment, made in 2007 -- the same year the iPhone debuted -- would have grown to a cool $3.5 million today, a mere 17 years later.\n\nAre there any stocks out there today with that type of potential? Of course. Here are three that might have what it takes. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nTopping the list is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The company that made former CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer some of the richest men in the world is once again the largest company on the face of the Earth with a market cap topping $3 trillion. And thanks to its many artificial intelligence (AI)-related ventures, Microsoft stands an excellent chance of creating many more fortunes.\n\nLet's start with the company's cloud services business. It's already a massive moneymaker for Microsoft, generating $25.9 billion in its most recent quarter (the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023). That makes it the second-largest cloud services vendor globally, trailing only Amazon Web Services.\n\nAs AI usage ramps up, Microsoft stands to benefit from increased cloud services. Indeed, after decelerating some in 2022, cloud spending appears to be reaccelerating as organizations explore how AI can improve their processes and generate efficiencies.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft's longstanding partnership with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, makes Microsoft a major player in the race to develop the next AI breakthrough.\n\nFinally, Microsoft's often underrated search, news, and advertising segment is gaining market share and growing at close to double-digits, thanks in part to its ChatGPT-powered features, which were added last year.\n\nMicrosoft has multiple pathways to riches on the AI front. Given its outstanding track record and excellent management, Microsoft could be one AI stock that makes many fortunes going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. CrowdStrike\n\nNext is CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). While nowhere near the size of Microsoft, CrowdStrike is still likely to make a number of fortunes in the coming years, thanks to its cutting-edge AI-powered cybersecurity offerings.\n\nThe company runs perhaps the premier cybersecurity platform available today, which protects networks, endpoints, and data through add-on modules that are tailored to its customers' needs. Its modules are scalable and designed to increase in effectiveness as their data inputs grow larger. In other words, CrowdStrike's product becomes better the longer a customer uses and feeds more data to its AI.\n\nWhat's more, this network effect isn't limited to just one customer. As more organizations adopt CrowdStrike's platform, its AI is able to draw on more scenarios and interactions that help the system detect and prevent unwanted activity across its entire protection umbrella -- similar to the way local law enforcement agencies can rely on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list to be on the lookout for specific individuals they themselves may have never encountered.\n\nFinancially, CrowdStrike is rocking and rolling. In its most recent quarter (the three months ended Oct. 31, 2023), the company reported $786 million in revenue, up 35% from a year earlier. Moreover, annual recurring revenue (ARR) -- a closely watched metric for companies selling subscription-based products -- increased to $3.15 billion, with $223 million of net new ARR added in the quarter.\n\nIn short, this means CrowdStrike is growing its subscription base, through bringing in new customers and by upselling additional security modules to existing customers.\n\nAt any rate, the company's solid growth points to big things ahead, as the number of cyber threats continues to grow -- meaning CrowdStrike's growth curve could extend for many years to come.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nLast, but by no means least, is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Let's face it: No company or stock has ridden the AI wave better or to greater heights than Nvidia. The company is now America's third-largest public company with a market cap hovering near $2 trillion -- up from $279 billion fewer than 18 months ago.\n\nImprobable as it may seem, it's entirely possible that Nvidia could continue its ascent -- even passing Apple and Microsoft to become the largest company globally.\n\nThat's because its rate of growth is truly eye-popping. Revenue grew 265% as of its most recent quarter (the three months ended Jan. 28). Moreover, estimates of future growth are sky-high.

        "content": "Surging cyber threats from nation-state actors and sophisticated ransomware have made security spending a priority for organizations. The massive spending boom will be a tailwind for cybersecurity stocks.\n\nWhile cyber was a priority area of spending, several factors have heightened the urgency. First, the risks from state-sponsored actors from nations like China and Russia have escalated. Notably, the warning by FBI Director Christopher Wray that Chinese hackers were preparing to attack critical infrastructure was ominous.\n\nSecondly, with the surge in ransomware attacks in 2023, organizations are now attentive. Executives saw the harm breaches like the Las Vegas casino hacks and Clorox (NYSE:CLX) attack caused on operations. In such a dangerous environment, taking preventative measures is a no-brainer, considering the dire consequences.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, due to Securities Exchange Commission disclosure guidelines, Chief Information Security Officers must prepare robust defenses. The latest news about a breach on United Health (NYSE:UNH) highlights the vulnerabilities companies are facing. Cybersecurity stocks will continue to see surging demand for their tools.\n\nCyberArk Software (CYBR) Cyberark (CYBR) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nCyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR) is a global leader in identity security solutions. Its software-as-a-service platform offers identity protection paired with the right level of controls. CyberArk is among the cybersecurity stocks firing on all cylinders and delivered superb results on Feb. 8.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, the company saw annual recurring revenues (ARR) surge 36% year-over-year (YOY) from $570 million to $774 million. Subscription annual recurring revenues grew from $364 million to $582 million, a 60% YOY growth. Due to the outsized growth, subscriptions now account for 75% of total ARR.\n\nThe quarter was a record for net new subscription ARR, adding $78 million. For the full year, the cybersecurity player added $204 million in net new ARR. In terms of customers, the firm ended the year with an impressive customer base. As of December 2023, 55% of Fortune 500 companies were customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of growth, management sees a $50 billion total addressable market. Thus, they are maintaining an optimistic outlook for 2024, expecting 22% to 24% revenue growth in 2024. Additionally, they expect ARR in the range of $968 to $983 million, representing 25% to 27% growth.\n\nCYBR stock is a buy today, given the healthy demand for identity security. It\u2019s a free cash flow positive growth stock that will ride industry tailwinds higher.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnder the stewardship of CEO George Kurtz, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been a trailblazer. It has achieved one of the best growth rates in the industry, recording a 68% compounded annual revenue growth rate over the last five years.\n\nToday, this cloud-native cloud security provider is a security giant with ARR hitting $3.15 billion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Yet, despite its size, the company continues to deliver start-up-like growth numbers. For instance, in the latest quarter reported on Nov. 28, 2023, total revenue increased by 35%.\n\nWhat\u2019s more impressive about Crowdstrike\u2019s growth is that it has maintained a higher level of profitability among cybersecurity stocks. Non-GAAP gross margins in Q3 were 78%, improving from 75% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. Additionally, the company generated free cash flow of $239 million.\n\nSeveral research firms have recognized Crowdstrike\u2019s platform, Falcon, for its robust security offerings. MITRE has awarded the product a 100% perfect coverage score across visibility, protection and analytic detections. It was also recognized last year as a leader in endpoint security by Forrester Wave.\n\nIn terms of growth, the company is growing through new customers and expanding current relationships. Module adoption rates were 63% and 42% for five or more and six or more, respectively. The firm is also releasing new products like the Raptor release for the next generation Falcon platform.\n\nGiven the massive runway from customer additions, CrowdStrike has a decade of growth ahead. Organizations are moving from fragmented multi-agent tools, and CrowdStrike\u2019s cloud-native single-platform architecture is the right choice.\n\nOkta (OKTA) Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy: Okta (OKTA)\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOkta (NASDAQ:OKTA) stock has had a series of fits and starts in the past year due to execution issues. First, the firm has suffered several breaches that have dented confidence. Secondly, there have been lingering concerns about customer growth due to these breaches.\n\nHowever, after an impressive Q4 FY2024 report where subscription revenue rose 20% YOY, it\u2019s time to have a second look. Results were outstanding across the board. Current remaining performance obligations increased 16% YOY and the firm generated free cash flow of $166 million.\n\nIndeed, customers are turning to Okta to power their identity infrastructure and manage their identity use cases. Particularly, revenue benefited due to a shift upmarket to large enterprise customers.\n\nGiven the impressive results, Bank of America analyst Madeline Brooks is stepping off the sidelines with an upgrade to \u201cbuy\u201d and a $135 price target. She argues that growth concerns are abating. Moreover, she sees management\u2019s FY2025 revenue guidance of $2.495 billion to $2.505 billion, representing 10% to 11% growth, as too conservative.\n\nEven better, they see the deal pipeline heading into FY2025 as very robust. Furthermore, with Okta landing larger enterprise clients, they expect an upside to revenue estimates. At a forward EV/Sales multiple of 5.5, Okta is relatively cheap compared to other fast-growing cybersecurity stocks. Fundamentals are improving and OKTA stock could soar.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on Mar 5.\n\nThe company anticipates fourth-quarter revenues in the band of $836.6-$840 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $839.1 million, indicating an improvement of 31.7% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.\n\nCrowdStrike expects non-GAAP earnings between 81 cents and 82 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings is pegged at 82 cents, which coincides with management\u2019s higher-end guidance. The consensus mark for the bottom line suggests an improvement of 74.5% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s non-GAAP earnings of 47 cents per share.\n\nThe company\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 16.6%.\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nCrowdStrike Price and EPS Surprise\n\nCrowdStrike price-eps-surprise | CrowdStrike Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results are likely to reflect the benefits of the continued solid demand for its products, given the healthy environment of the global security market. The increasing number of people logging into employers' networks has triggered a greater need for security and might have spurred the demand for CRWD\u2019s products in the fiscal fourth quarter. A strong pipeline of deals indicates the same.\n\nStellar revenue growth in subscriptions might have contributed significantly to the fourth-quarter top line. Further, the increasing number of net new subscription customers may have acted as a tailwind.\n\nOur fourth-quarter estimate for Subscription revenues is pegged at $788.9 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 31.9%. Revenues from the Professional Services segment are likely to increase 22.4% year over year to $47.8 million in the fourth quarter.\n\nMoreover, CrowdStrike\u2019s collaboration with Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) is an upside, benefiting the company from its products\u2019 availability on the AWS platform. The expansion in the volume of transactions through Amazon\u2019s AWS Marketplace, growth in co-selling opportunities with AWS salesforce and the uptake of AWS service integrations are likely to have contributed to CRWD\u2019s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, elevated expenses for enhancing sales and marketing capabilities and increased investments in research and development are likely to have weighed on the company\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter bottom line.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for CrowdStrike this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that\u2019s not the case here.\n\nThough CRWD currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1, it has an Earnings ESP of -0.08%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, SEMrush SEMR, Guidewire Software GWRE and TD SYNNEX SNX have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\n\nSEMrush carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +23.08%. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Mar 4. Its bottom-line result surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 112.5%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for SEMrush\u2019s fourth-quarter bottom line is pegged at earnings of 3 cents per share, indicating a robust improvement from the year-ago quarter\u2019s loss of 8 cents. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $83.2 million, calling for a year-over-year increase of 20.9%.\n\nGuidewire Software is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Mar 7. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +4.76% at present. Guidewire Software\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing on one occasion, the average surprise being -42.22%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 21 cents per share, suggesting a strong improvement from the year-ago quarter\u2019s loss of 21 cents. Guidewire Software\u2019s quarterly revenues are estimated to improve 3.6% to $240.9 million.\n\nTD SYNNEX carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.76%. The company is anticipated to report first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Mar 26. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters while missing on one occasion, with the average surprise being 7.4%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for TD SYNNEX\u2019s first-quarter earnings stands at $2.86 per share, indicating a year-over-year decline of 2.4%. It is estimated to report revenues of $14.37 billion, which implies a decrease of approximately 5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Vishay\u2019s shares have lost 9.6% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 9.2%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2024 revenues is pegged at $733.20 million, indicating a fall of 15.8% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nVishay currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are CrowdStrike CRWD, Badger Meter BMI and AMETEK AME.

        "content": "Earnings season is winding down but there are still some popular and red-hot companies that have yet to report. Even though the Earnings All Star videos are ending for the season, it\u2019s still vital to check in on these end-of-the-season all-stars.\n\nTwo of them have not missed in the last 5 years and one only has one miss during that same period. It\u2019s not easy beating every quarter, or nearly every quarter, for 5 years. It was also during the pandemic years, which makes these earnings surprise track records even more impressive.\n\nThese stocks are popular but the companies themselves also have loyal fan bases.\n\nMost of these stocks are hitting new highs going into this report. Will they be able to surprise again and keep the rally going?\n\nThis Week\u2019s 5 Red-Hot Earnings Charts\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD)\n\nCrowdStrike has not missed since its 2019 IPO. That\u2019s impressive given the pandemic.\n\nShares of CrowdStrike have busted out to new all-time highs in 2024, gaining 174% over the last year. It\u2019s not cheap, with a forward P/E of 85.\n\nWill CrowdStrike beat again?\n\n2. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF)\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch, the specialty apparel and accessory retailer, has put together 3 huge earnings beats in a row. It has been one of the hottest stocks this year.\n\nShares of Abercrombie & Fitch have jumped 335% over the last year. Abercrombie & Fitch still trades with an attractive forward P/E of 18.9.\n\nIs Abercrombie & Fitch simply too hot to handle?\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU)\n\nLululemon has only missed one time in the last 5 years and it was in 2020 when the covid pandemic first hit. That\u2019s an impressive track record given all the supply chain issues that hit the retailers the last few years.\n\nShares of Lululemon are up 52% over the last year but are off recent highs. It now trades with a forward P/E of 31.\n\nWill Lululemon surprise again this quarter?\n\nStory continues\n\n4. Broadcom Inc. (AVGO)\n\nBroadcom has a perfect 5 years earnings track record. It is an earnings all-star. What an impressive chart.\n\nShares of Broadcom are breaking out to new all-time highs in 2024. It is up 126% over the last year. Broadcom\u2019s forward P/E is now 27.\n\nWill another earnings beat be a catalyst to send Broadcom shares even higher?\n\n5. Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST)\n\nCostco has only missed on earnings 3 times in the last 5 years. It has beat 4 quarters in a row.\n\nShares of Costco have busted out to new all-time highs in 2024, gaining 52% in the last year. It\u2019s not cheap. Costco trades with a forward P/E of 47.\n\nWill this report, which covers the holiday period, be a catalyst to push Costco shares even higher?\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of LULU in her own personal portfolio and owns shares of AVGO in the Insider Trader portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Recently,\u00a0more and more companies are offering AI-powered solutions and products every day to ride the wave of AI stocks. Yet for investors, this can be confusing, as just because a company claims to incorporate AI, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean profitability. Now, more than ever, understanding the value an AI brings to a technological product or service is critical for investing.\n\nThe projects investors should look out for tend to have two different identifiers for determining product value. The first is any application where AI provides a generative product, such as a chat answer or a visual image. This is the application most commonly thought of when discussing AI, but it\u2019s far from the most lucrative.\u00a0AI computing applications, like data interpretation and network processing, are the second and most impactful to the tech industry.\n\nFor investors looking to understand these applications, these three\u00a0AI stocks provided insight into the long-term potential of artificial intelligence.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAI Stocks: Nvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA company logo on smartphone against background of red stock chart. Business crisis, collapse of trading and investment, bankruptcy, falling value concept. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecently,\u00a0Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) seems to be at the center of the AI universe thanks to aggressive investing in the integration process. This is because the tech giant applies its expertise in graphics processing units to accelerate AI development. As such, there are three major projects currently driving Nvidia\u2019s meteoric rise that investors should watch.\n\nFirst, the\u00a0Nvidia DGX Systems\u00a0are custom supercomputers that specialize in data processing for AI learning and research. Second, the Nvidia Deep Learning Institute offers expert-level education to developers looking to apply AI to their projects. Third, and potentially most important, Nvidia\u2019s new\u00a0A100 Tensor Core GPU\u00a0has a memory bandwidth of 2 terabytes per second.\n\nTherefore, the GPU can process data at never-before-possible speeds, exponentially accelerating the learning speed of current large language models. As Nvidia continues cementing its market dominance, innovation-driven investors cannot afford to pass up the best AI stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith its\u00a02023 revenue reaching over 2.24 billion dollars, CrowdStrike\u2019s (NASDAQ:CRWD) rise to success has been astonishing. In an increasingly connected and computerized world, CrowdStrike\u2019s focus on cybersecurity has led to a highly profitable business model. Continuing this success now hinges on using AI computing to protect networks as the industry booms.\n\nTo achieve this, CrowdStrike currently leverages AI and machine learning algorithms to scan networks in real-time and detect threats. Further increasing security, CrowdStrike also uses\u00a0AI to recognize dangerous behavioral patterns\u00a0that could lead to new cyber attack methods. Ultimately, CrowdStrike\u2019s AI applications rely on high-speed data processing to decide how to keep a customer\u2019s network safe.\n\nThanks to this innovative AI-driven cybersecurity approach, CrowdStrike maintains a strong buy rating. Moreover, as the future of computing moves towards the cloud,\u00a0CrowdStrike profits could soar\u00a0alongside AI stocks.\n\nArista (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a 31% annual stock growth rate, Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) now plans to use AI as rocket fuel to keep climbing. Arista specializes in telemetry and analytics using network switches to keep a finger on the pulse of internet traffic flows. The company also currently offers services in security and protection, as well as intent-based networking.\n\nTo maximize profits using AI, Arista will likely use machine learning to take\u00a0high-level business objectives and apply them to network policy. By doing so, Arista assures that policy compliance flows down thoroughly throughout network requirements.\n\nFurthermore, Arista networks could continue to benefit from the expanding popularity of generative AI. That\u2019s because it\u00a0increases demand for network switches for training large language models, which directly influences Arista\u2019s offerings. Savvy investors would be wise to jump on Arista\u2019s transition into becoming one of the AI stocks of the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Top Trader\u201d Issues A.I.

        "title": "Is It Worth Investing in CrowdStrike (CRWD) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nCrowdStrike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.17, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 42 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.17 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 42 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 37 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 88.1% and 7.1% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CRWD Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRWD\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for CrowdStrike here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying CrowdStrike, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in CRWD?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for CrowdStrike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.4% over the past month to $2.95.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for CrowdStrike. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for CrowdStrike may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "SPRX: This Unknown ETF Returned Nearly 90% Last Year",
        "content": "With just $72.3 million in assets under management (AUM), the Spear Alpha ETF (NASDAQ:SPRX) is tiny and unknown, but with a total return of nearly 90% last year, it\u2019s worthy of more attention. I\u2019m bullish on this new, under-the-radar ETF based on its eye-catching performance last year and its concentrated, compelling collection of growth stocks, which ties together an interesting collection of promising themes.\n\nWhat Is the SPRX ETF\u2019s Strategy?\n\nThe Spear Alpha ETF is an actively-managed ETF from Spear Funds that \u201cinvests in companies benefiting from breakthrough trends in industrial technology.\u201d\n\nSPRX\u2019s aim is to find and invest in \u201cunderappreciated opportunities across different value chains that are beneficiaries of\u2026\u201d secular themes such as artificial intelligence (AI), automation and robotics, enterprise digitalization, environmental focus and decarbonization, photonics and additive manufacturing, and space exploration.\u00a0SPRX looks for long-term capital growth.\n\nEclectic Group of Holdings\n\nSPRX holds just 27 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 75% of assets, so this is not a diversified ETF.\u00a0However, SPRX seeks to be an actively-managed, concentrated fund, so diversification isn\u2019t really the goal. If the fund\u2019s top picks do well, the fund is going to do very well, and if they don\u2019t, it is going to perform poorly.\n\nBelow is an overview of SPRX\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nAs you can see, SPRX hits the theme of investing in generative AI through its top two holdings, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Nvidia makes up 11.9% of the fund\u2019s assets, while Advanced Micro Devices accounts for 9.9%. These large positions paid off, as Nvidia is up 235.5% over the past year, while Advanced Micro Devices is up 124.1%. Within this theme, the fund also has a top 10 position in Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), which is up 53.2% over the past year.\n\nBeyond generative AI, the fund\u2019s managers also clearly have a favorable view toward cybersecurity stocks, as Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS), and SentinelOne (NYSE:S) are all top 10 positions.\n\nStory continues\n\nSPRX is also invested in a handful of software stocks, including Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), Confluent (NASDAQ:CFLT), and Hubspot (NYSE:HUBS). Electric vehicles appear to be another area of interest as the fund is invested in both Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN).\n\nWhile the fund clearly skews towards technology stocks, interestingly, SPRX isn\u2019t the type of fund that simply invests in the household name tech stocks and calls it a day. The fund notably has investments in several basic materials and metals and mining stocks, including Freeport McMoran (NYSE:FCX), Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), and Albemarle (NYSE:ALB).\n\nThis is a smart area for a fund focused on electrification and decarbonization to invest in. SPRX\u2019s managers clearly recognize that if the world is going to electrify more of its vehicle fleet and power grid, then copper from companies like Freeport McMoran and lithium from companies like Albemarle are going to be more in demand.\n\nI actually prefer investments in stocks like these to the likes of Rivian and other EV stocks because, unlike Rivian, they are making profits right now, they trade for inexpensive valuations, and many of them are also dividend stocks.\n\nAll in all, SPRX has an interesting portfolio and takes an omnivorous approach toward investing in what it sees as the major growth themes that it believes will drive the market, going forward.\n\nEye-CatchingPerformance\n\nSPRX only launched in 2021, so it doesn\u2019t yet have a long track record of performance to evaluate it.\u00a0The fund had a difficult 2022, losing 45.0% for the year as the market punished tech and growth stocks.\n\nHowever, it bounced back in resounding fashion in 2023, with a spectacular gain of 88.0%.\n\nWhile technology and growth stocks were up generally, SPRX\u2019s gain of 88% still stands out, as its returns easily surpassed those of popular tech and growth-themed index ETFs. For example, the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) returned 54.9% for the year, and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK) returned 56.0%.\u00a0To be clear, these are fantastic returns that any investor would be happy with, but SPRX still managed to beat them for the year.\n\nSPRX also outperformed perhaps the most popular actively-managed technology ETF in the market, the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK), which returned a stellar 67.6% in 2023.\n\nWhile it would be unreasonable to expect SPRX, or any ETF, to continue to put up these types of results, the fund looks promising based on what it has achieved thus far.\n\nWhat Is SPRX\u2019s Expense Ratio?\n\nOne downside of SPRX is that its expense ratio of 0.75% is on the high side. This 0.75% expense ratio means that an investor in the fund will pay $75 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually.\n\nThat being said, this is a smaller, actively managed ETF, so it is unsurprising that its fees are high. It\u2019s also worth noting that these fees aren\u2019t out of line with other popular actively managed technology ETFs. For example, the aforementioned ARK Innovation ETF also charges 0.75%.\n\nIf the fund is performing well like it did last year, many investors won\u2019t mind paying this expense ratio, but if its performance suffers a downturn, this fee could end up being a bitter pill for investors to swallow.\n\nIs SPRX Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SPRX earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SPRX stock price target of $26.91 implies 8.1% upside potential.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nSPRX is a small, under-the-radar, actively managed technology ETF that burst onto the scene with a return of nearly 90% last year, outperforming popular technology and growth index ETFs as well as popular actively-managed tech ETFs. The fund clearly warrants further attention from investors.\n\nWhile it would be unreasonable to expect it to continue to put up results at these levels, its track record so far is impressive, and it looks like it is continuing this momentum with a return of 9.9% thus far in 2024.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on this ETF based on its supercharged performance and its intriguing portfolio, which brings in a variety of growth themes ranging from AI to the materials needed for vehicle electrification. SPRX brings a unique and omnivorous approach to growth investing that you don\u2019t find in all tech funds, many of which buy large-cap tech companies and call it a day.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that as a small, actively-managed fund, SPRX is a pricey investment option with an expense ratio of 0.75%. If the fund continues to soundly outperform the market from here, this expense ratio will be water under the bridge, but these high fees could start to sting if the fund underperforms.\n\nGiven its short track record, high fees, and concentrated portfolio, SPRX is likely best suited for risk-tolerant investors.\n\nDisclosure",

The company's earnings report is expected on March 5, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $0.82, indicating a 74.47% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $839.08 million, showing a 31.65% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for CrowdStrike Holdings. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.4% upward. CrowdStrike Holdings presently features a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nInvestors should also note CrowdStrike Holdings's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 87.88. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 31.09, so one might conclude that CrowdStrike Holdings is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's also important to note that CRWD currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.44. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. CRWD's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.82 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 68, positioning it in the top 27% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) reached a significant support level, and could be a good pick for investors from a technical perspective. Recently, CRWD broke through the 20-day moving average, which suggests a short-term bullish trend.\n\nThe 20-day simple moving average is a well-liked trading tool because it provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period. Additionally, short-term traders find this SMA very beneficial, as it smooths out short-term price trends and shows more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.\n\nSimilar to other SMAs, if a stock's price moves above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive, while price falling below the moving average can signal a downward trend.\n\nOver the past four weeks, CRWD has gained 6.8%. The company is currently ranked a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), another strong indication the stock could move even higher.\n\nThe bullish case solidifies once investors consider CRWD's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 2 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.\n\nGiven this move in earnings estimate revisions and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on CRWD for more gains in the near future.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing in just about any Magnificent 7 stocks earlier in 2023 would have made anyone significant returns. The Nasdaq, which tracks many major technology equities,\u00a0rose\u00a0by 43.4% in 2023, beating all other major indices. The S&P500 and the Nasdaq are up nearly 7% since the start of the current year. Undergirding the rally are the legacy tech giants and rising technology disruptors. Below are three tech disruptors investors should own now.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity firm on the rise, and the company has undoubtedly come a long way. IDC said CrowdStrike was the\u00a0largest player\u00a0in the Worldwide Endpoint Security market in 2022, even outpacing Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\u00a0In Q4 2023, Forrester, an IT research and consulting firm, also named CrowdStrike, a leader in the space.\n\nThe cybersecurity firm specializes in cloud-based\u00a0endpoint protection and threat intelligence services. Its comprehensive platform leverages artificial intelligence, behavioral analytics and threat intelligence to detect and prevent breaches.\u00a0CrowdStrike\u2019s comprehensive suite of solutions has led to its meteoric rise. The company\u2019s Q4 earnings underscored how a cybersecurity firm could grow even during economic uncertainty. In particular, CrowdStrike beat earnings Wall Street estimates and saw top-line growth in 2023, reaching 54% on a year-over-year basis, while revenue for the quarter increased 45% year-over-year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s shares have climbed more than 140% by the end of 2023. In 2024, the cybersecurity firm\u2019s share price has risen more than 22%. As enterprises continue to pursue digital transformation plans, CrowdStrike will definitely be a beneficiary.\n\nManhattan Associates (MANH) a backlit photograph of the statue of liberty against the skyscrapers of NYC\n\nInvestors traumatized by post-COVID supply chain bottlenecks that created enormous cost pressures for many companies might be interested in Manhattan Associates (NASDAQ:MANH). The company is a leading provider of software solutions for supply chain management, inventory optimization and omnichannel commerce. Three of Manhattan\u2019s solutions include Omnichannel Commerce, Supply Chain Execution and Supply Chain Planning.\u00a0Omnichannel Commerce\u00a0helps companies connect with their suppliers better while automating the purchase order process.\u00a0Supply Chain Execution\u00a0tools allow companies to manage their warehouses or shipyards and understand which products are where and which transportation vehicles are in use. The\u00a0last solution offers\u00a0a layer of data analytics on the first two solutions, providing companies with demand forecasting capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nManhattan Associates also had a strong end to 2024. The company beat Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates, and revenue for the full year rose 22% to $929 million. Manhattan Associates\u2019 management team also provided rosy guidance for 2024. Supply chain solutions will continue to be in demand, especially as two critical canals, the Panama Canal and the Suez, have suffered blockages. Manhattan Associates\u2019 shares rose 77% in 2023, and the stock could rally even more as investors allocate capital to companies bringing digital transformation to supply chains globally.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir\u2019s (NYSE:PLTR) artificial intelligence solutions are definitely gaining traction. In the company\u2019s third quarter earnings report, the company\u2019s \u201cU.S. Commercial business segment\u201d increased revenue figures by 37% on a year-over-basis driven by demand for Palantir\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Platform. The data analytics firm\u2019s AIP can deploy commercial and open-source large language models onto internally held data sets and, from there, recommend business processes and actions. Similarly, in their fourth quarter report, not only did financial figures come above Wall Street estimates, but CEO Alex Karp noted there was strong demand for AIP.\n\nThis point excited investors as Palantir\u2019s shares popped 19% during the after-hours trading session. Many Wall Street analysts were concerned that Palantir\u2019s AI solutions were only hype, but that was not the case based on customer demand.\n\nWhile Palantir\u2019s valuation is certainly looking stretched, the company\u2019s prospects could widen as AI solutions continue rising in popularity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Trending Stock CrowdStrike (CRWD) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this cloud-based security company have returned +7.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which CrowdStrike falls in, has gained 11.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share, indicating a change of +74.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.95 points to a change of +91.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 indicates a change of +23.8% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for CrowdStrike.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate of $839.08 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +31.7%. The $3.05 billion and $3.91 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +36.1% and +28.3%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $786.01 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +35.3%. EPS of $0.82 for the same period compares with $0.40 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $777.2 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.13%. The EPS surprise was +10.81%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Market Downturn? 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy With $1,000 and Hold Forever",
        "content": "The past few months, as stock prices have primarily marched higher, have felt great. However, the emotions of investing can also trap investors and shorten memories. It wasn't that long ago that the mood on Wall Street was doom and gloom.\n\nIt's easy to forget just how volatile Wall Street can be. Generally speaking, the market doesn't go in one direction for too long, and the pivot can sometimes happen fast. Many technology stocks have hit sudden turbulence over the past week or so, which could signal that this bull market's first correction is upon us.\n\nEmbrace it. Corrections are healthy and allow investors to buy high-flying stocks on a pullback. Some of the leading artificial intelligence (AI) stocks come to mind here.\n\nHere are three stocks that investors can buy for under $1,000 and confidently hold for the long term. Consider nibbling now and buying more aggressively if market weakness continues.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nData and AI software company Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) is generating a ton of growth momentum with commercial customers after building its business catering mainly to the U.S. government and its allies. Palantir builds custom software on its proprietary platforms, which help customers analyze data and trends, aiding real-time decision-making in end markets ranging from national security to healthcare. The bottom-line pitch is that data is becoming a competitive edge, and Palantir helps its customers tap into their data.\n\nIt's still remarkably early in Palantir's growth story. The company ended 2023 with just 375 commercial accounts. There are 350,000 large corporations worldwide. Now, Palantir's top 20 customers each spend over $55 million annually on average, so this software isn't going to fit into every company's budget. But it seems reasonable that Palantir could build a customer base in the thousands over the next decade and beyond.\n\nThe best part is that Palantir is also becoming a very profitable company. It's consistently profitable according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and analysts believe earnings could compound at 26% annually over the next three to five years. It isn't cheap, even for its expected growth, at 69 times earnings. Investors should relish a market pullback that offers up Palantir at lower prices.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nTechnology conglomerate Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has wedged itself into the AI battle, leaning on its cloud platform Azure and its strong partnership with ChatGPT and Sora creator OpenAI. Microsoft is weaving AI technology into its business, including Microsoft 365 software, Bing search, and enterprise software apps. Azure also powers AI for other companies as the world's second-leading cloud platform.\n\nThe great thing about Microsoft is that it's such a robust and well-rounded company that investors get some upside from AI but ultimately hold a forever stock. Microsoft generates nearly $70 billion in annual free cash flow and carries a fortress-like balance sheet with a AAA credit rating, higher than the U.S. government. In other words, Microsoft might be the world's least likely company to fail.\n\nThe combination of AI excitement and Microsoft's sterling reputation have priced the stock at a lofty 34 times earnings, and analysts expect earnings growth averaging 16% annually moving forward. If market weakness brings shares down from their all-time highs, investors should put Microsoft near the top of their buying list.\n\n3. CrowdStrike Holdings\n\nCybersecurity is a tremendous long-term growth trend. The increasingly digital economy demands better security technology to protect against sophisticated attacks and hackers. CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) is among a new cohort of next-generation security platforms that use cloud technology and AI to provide real-time protection that adapts and improves on the fly.\n\nCrowdStrike sells different products and services in modules, and cross-selling to customers has supported strong revenue growth. Approximately 63% of customers pay for at least five modules as of Q3 of CrowdStrike's fiscal year 2024, and 26% pay for seven or more. The business is highly profitable, converting 30% of its revenue to cash flow, and has an additional $2.4 billion in net cash.\n\nThe stock's been on a tear, soaring 170% over the past year. Today, CrowdStrike trades at 80 times earnings, which is steep, even with annual earnings growth expected to average 36%. Again, investors shouldn't try to time their first purchase perfectly but don't jump in all at once out of fear of missing the boat. Build a position slowly, and lean into buying if the market starts pouring cold water on the stock's hot momentum.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

The cybersecurity company went public at $34 with a valuation of $6.7 billion, and it now trades at about $300 with a market cap of $70 billion.\n\nThe bulls loved CrowdStrike because it was disrupting older cybersecurity companies with its cloud-native services, which locked its customers into sticky subscriptions and eliminated the need for on-site appliances. From fiscal 2020 (which ended in Jan. 2020) to fiscal 2023, its annual revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 67% as its total number of subscription customers more than quadrupled from 5,431 to 23,019.\n\nThose breakneck growth rates are impressive, but could CrowdStrike continue expanding and become a trillion-dollar company by 2040? Let's review its business model to see if it has a shot at joining the four-comma club. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCrowdStrike's hypergrowth days could be over\n\nAnalysts expect CrowdStrike's revenue to rise 36% in fiscal 2024, 29% in fiscal 2025, and 26% in fiscal 2026. We should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but they suggest its business is maturing as it faces more competitors.\n\nFor example, Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) is expanding into the cloud security market with Prisma, Microsoft is rolling out more first-party cybersecurity services for its cloud-based ecosystem, Cisco is integrating more cybersecurity services into its own networking equipment, and its smaller challenger SentinelOne is trying to automate the entire threat detection process with AI algorithms across a hybrid mix of on-site appliances and cloud-based services.\n\nThe cloud-native network security market could expand at a CAGR of 14% from 2024 to 2029, according to Global Market Estimates. Mordor Intelligence expects the cloud endpoint security market -- where CrowdStrike's Falcon mainly operates -- to grow at a CAGR of only 12% during the same period.\n\nCrowdStrike might continue to grow faster than the broader industry as it expands its ecosystem and gobbles up its smaller competitors, but it probably can't replicate its hypergrowth rates from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023. That gradual slowdown could be worrisome for a stock that already trades at 23 times next year's sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow fast will CrowdStrike grow over the next 16 years?\n\nIf CrowdStrike grows its top line at a CAGR of 20% from 2023 to 2040, its annual revenue will rise from $2.2 billion to $50 billion. If it's still trading at 20 times sales by then, its market cap could hit $1 trillion. That said, it would need to play its cards nearly perfectly to maintain that high growth rate and premium valuation.\n\nWith a more conservative CAGR of 15% -- which seems more realistic as it faces tougher competitive challenges and unpredictable macro headwinds -- its revenue would reach $24 billion by 2040. If it's trading at a more reasonable 10 times sales, which would be comparable to Palo Alto Networks' current price-to-sales ratio, it could be worth about $240 billion.\n\nFocus on these core growth metrics instead\n\nSimply put, CrowdStrike has a narrow but viable path toward hitting a trillion-dollar valuation by 2040 -- but it could easily fall short of that lofty target as its growth cools off.\n\nSo instead of wondering if CrowdStrike will ever become a trillion-dollar company, investors should focus on its growth in customers and their increased adoption of its cloud modules instead. In its latest quarter, 42% of its customers were using at least six of its modules, compared to 36% of its customers a year ago. It's also remained profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis for three consecutive quarters as it reined in its spending and stock-based compensation.\n\nThose fundamental improvements indicate its ecosystem is sticky and that it still has plenty of pricing power in the crowded cybersecurity market. So as a long-term investor in CrowdStrike, I believe it could still easily generate more multibagger gains over the next two decades -- and I'm not concerned about its ability to join the 12-zero club in the distant future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why",
        "content": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) jumped 5.8% in the morning session as chip and AI stocks surged alongside broader market gains, with the Nasdaq rising by 2.1%, the S&P 500 by 1.5%, and the Dow gaining 0.57% following Nvidia's outstanding earnings results. During its Q4'2024 earnings, Nvidia reported impressive topline results (7.6% revenue beat), big gross margin improvement, and EPS outperformance vs. Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue grew 265% year-on-year and 22% sequentially during the quarter. The strong topline performance was mostly driven by the data center segment, which was up 409% year-over-year and 27% sequentially as demand for Nvidia processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs (large language models), and other AI workloads continued to accelerate. The company estimated that roughly 40% of Data Center revenue was driven by AI-related applications.\n\nGuidance for the next quarter was also good, with revenue, gross margin, and implied operating profit coming in ahead of expectations. Overall, Nvidia's strong performance during the quarter highlighted the growing demand for AI-related technology and demonstrated the abundant growth opportunity for innovators within the space.\n\nIs now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nCrowdStrike's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 15 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was one day ago, when the company dropped 11.8% after cybersecurity stocks fell as industry stalwart, Palo Alto Networks reported fourth-quarter results and lowered full-year guidance for revenue and billings, with both metrics also falling below Wall Street's expectations. This is never a good sign. Furthermore, billings and revenue guidance for next quarter also missed Wall Street's estimates, with EPS below as well. Palo Alto Networks highlighted many challenges during the quarter, including 1.) weakness in the U.S. federal vertical, which impacted billings and revenue growth, and 2) Customers' conservativeness regarding upfront cash payments.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe long-term demand forecast provided was also concerning as management highlighted the possibility of \"a period of 12 to 18 months of pressure on our top-line growth rates, notably billings.\" In addition, the top-line growth metrics are expected to be impacted by the company's shift towards a \"platformization\" strategy, which will make it easier for customers to consolidate their usage of cybersecurity solutions and provide the possibility of accessing some products for free in the early adoption phase. Under this strategy, Palo Alto Networks noted that a typical customer adopting the platform \" will not pay us for our technology for a period of time. As these programs ramp over the next year, we expect a change to our billings and revenue growth for the next 12 to 18 months.\" This strategy may drive more competition within the cybersecurity space as industry players adjust their pricing/product strategies to stay competitive.\n\nOverall, this was a weaker quarter for Palo Alto Networks, with the poor guidance highlighting several issues within the business as well as potential challenges for cybersecurity players in the coming quarter.\n\nCrowdStrike is up 25.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $308.88 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $334.55 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike's shares at the IPO in June 2019 would now be looking at an investment worth $5,325.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.",

        "title": "Cyberattacks are the No. 1 worry for business leaders\u2014and AI may be able to help",
        "content": "Executives consider cyberattacks the top threat to their companies, and artificial intelligence only exacerbates the risk by helping hackers infiltrate computer systems more quickly and effectively. But AI can also help protect businesses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for companies to look for these next-generation technologies to identify and prevent attacks using things like AI,\u201d George Kurtz, CEO of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, told Fortune.\n\nThe number of cyberattacks in the U.S. hit an all-time high in 2023 with more than 3,200 breaches, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that educates the public about cybercrime. These breaches threaten businesses because they can shut down sales, destroy reputations, create legal headaches, and put individual customers in danger.\n\nCrowdStrike monitors companies\u2019 systems for hacking and blocks cyberattacks based on what it calls \u201cindicators of attack,\u201d or IOAs. These IOAs are sequences of events in a computer system that signal a breach might be taking place. For example, a signal may include a user downloading an online file and opening it, and then the file uploading code, erasing other computer files, and deleting their backups. Each of these actions alone might indicate normal computer use but together suggest something nefarious.\n\n\u201cThere are only so many ways to rob a bank,\u201d Kurtz said, comparing the methodology of hacking to another kind of crime. \u201cYou have to get in and get out. It doesn\u2019t matter what shirt you\u2019re wearing, or whether you have a gun or a knife.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, there are only so many ways to commit a cyberattack, and CrowdStrike dreams up new scenarios through IOAs and tries to stop them. Previously, CrowdStrike researchers and analysts would create these IOAs by hand, said chief technology officer Elia Zaitsev. They collected patterns of behavior on customers\u2019 computer systems, read about new kinds of hacks, and came up with sequences of actions for their technology to look for. \u201cIt\u2019s very time-consuming,\u201d Zaitsev told Fortune.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut in 2022, the company launched AI-powered IOAs. CrowdStrike\u2019s AI systems can crawl through the trillions of data points from its customers\u2014including Target, Salesforce, Intel, and Wyoming\u2019s state government\u2014and suggest new patterns that may signal breaches.\n\n\u201cIt gets smarter as it goes through the data,\u201d Kurtz said. \u201cIt finds more, and then it gets better, and then it finds more.\u201d\n\nThe AI-powered IOAs are also more effective than human-created sequences, Zaitsev added. \u201cWe have found that the AI-powered IOAs are better at catching the bad stuff but also less noisy in detecting benign things,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cIt\u2019s giving us our cake and letting us eat it too.\u201d\n\nOther cybersecurity companies are using AI in similar ways. Darktrace, a British cybersecurity company, uses AI to learn the intricacies of individual companies and identify when a user or device deviates from how they normally work, signaling a potential breach. Microsoft\u2019s security business, called Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, also uses AI to predict if devices are at risk for an attack and automatically increases security if it determines they are.\n\nWhile cybersecurity protections can help companies identify and stop attacks, they aren\u2019t foolproof. Cyber experts are often left playing catch-up with bad actors who are constantly figuring out new techniques. Just as cyber companies are using AI to stop attacks, hackers are adopting it, and breaches are getting more sophisticated as a result. For example, AI can write a persuasive phishing email without the typos or format inconsistencies that may be a red flag to a target. It can also aid in cloning the voice of a family member, which can be used to ask for money over the phone.\n\n\u201cAI is a wonderful tool for defenders,\u201d said George Berg, associate professor and former chair of the information security department at the State University of New York at Albany. \u201cBut it is at least comparably effective for offenders.\n\n\u201cAll an attacker needs is to find one weakness to access a system,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cA defender has to find and block all of them. The advantage is with the attacker.\u201d\n\nHacking grunt work\n\nCyberattacks happen for many reasons. Nation-state groups may be looking to gather intelligence on specific companies. Last month, for example, a suspected Russian state-sponsored group hacked into Microsoft and accessed corporate email accounts, looking for information related to the group itself, Microsoft said.\n\nMoney is another motivator. Bad actors may break in, encrypt files, and demand ransom. In 2021, meat processor JBSpaid an $11 million ransom to hackers after a breach, the U.S. division chief said at the time, that caused a daylong shutdown of all its U.S. beef plants and interruptions at poultry and pork operations. Hacking groups may also deface websites as a form of activism. Such was the case in 2020 when foreign hackers posted messages on dozens of U.S. government websites to express their anger after a U.S. airstrike killed an Iranian general.\n\n\u201cFor a nation-state attack, AI will help the hackers a little bit, but they already have people with insane skills,\u201d Arthur Conklin, information security professor at the University of Houston, told Fortune. \u201cFor the people doing botnets and ransomware\u2014the common criminals of the internet\u2014it will help them incredibly.\u201d\n\nHacking is a \u201clong path with boring grunt work,\u201d he said, including writing code and searching through data\u2014tasks that AI can do with enough precision to be effective. Because AI supercharges and speeds up hacks, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see an increased number of attacks in the future, Berg added.\n\nGenerative AI, too\n\nZaitsev of CrowdStrike acknowledges the difficulties. \u201cIt\u2019s an arms race where you\u2019re always a step behind the adversaries,\u201d he said.\n\nCrowdStrike has another AI product that is supposed to make it easier for both security professionals and employees with little technology experience to protect themselves and their companies. In addition to CrowdStrike\u2019s AI-powered IOAs, the company last year introduced a generative AI chatbot called Charlotte AI that can answer questions from anyone using CrowdStrike security products about their individual systems, such as whether they are vulnerable to a specific kind of attack. It can also explain cybersecurity problems, like what a specific kind of malware is and how to avoid it. As a resource for an entire company, Charlotte can help onboard novice users and further train experienced ones, Zaitsev said.\n\nIt can also gather information and perform tasks for an IT department. For example, a user may enter a query, \u201cShow me all failed log-in attempts from New York,\u201d and the system will offer a list, giving security personnel the information they need to take further steps.\n\n\u201cCharlotte will be another leg of growth for us,\u201d Kurtz said, adding that AI is at the core of what\u2019s growing the company.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

As of 1:35 p.m. ET, shares of Zscaler(NASDAQ: ZS) had plunged by 13.9%, SentinelOne(NYSE: S) was down 10.8%, CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) had tumbled by 9.4%, Fortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT) was off by 4.2%, and Cloudflare(NYSE: NET) had lost 4.2%.\n\nA check of all the usual sources -- regulatory filings, analyst commentary, and financial reports -- found no company-specific news fueling these declines, suggesting the stock price moves were driven by the dismal outlook and strategy shift by a rival in the space. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSolid results with a dose of uncertainty\n\nAfter the close Tuesday, Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW)reported results for its fiscal 2024 second quarter, and investors were taken aback. For the period, which ended Jan. 31, revenue grew 19% year over year to $2 billion, driven higher by expanding relationships with existing customers. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.46, up 39%.\n\nThose results exceeded analysts' consensus estimates, which had called for revenue of $1.97 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.30.\n\nHowever, it was a dramatic shift in the company's strategy that surprised investors, and which led management to slash Palo Alto's full-year guidance.\n\nPalo Alto Networks offers three platforms, which include network security, cloud security, and security operations. CEO Nikesh Arora announced Palo Alto was seeking to accelerate its multiplatform strategy. He noted that the customer lifetime value of a client that adopted two of its three platforms was five times the value of a single-platform customer. For those that adopt three platforms, the number is more than 40 times larger -- so it's understandable that the company would seek to accelerate multiplatform adoption.\n\nTo support this shift in strategy, management noted that beginning Thursday, it will be \"launching a significant number of platform offers to our customers\" in the form of incentives, free trials, and discounts. Over the next 12 to 18 months as this program ramps up, Arora expects Palo Alto to take a hit to revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of that, management has reduced its guidance. For the company's fiscal third quarter, management is guiding for revenue in a range of $1.95 billion and $1.98 billion, which would amount to year-over-year growth of 14% at the midpoint. Perhaps most telling is its outlook for billings to grow by just 3% to $2.33 billion, which illustrates the consequences of the company's decision -- at least over the short term.\n\nArora also noted the company was beginning to see \"spending fatigue in cybersecurity.\" Investors took that as a bad sign for the whole industry, and many stocks in the space sold off in unison.\n\nMaking a mountain out of a company-specific molehill\n\nSo what does all this mean for Palo Alto's rivals?\n\nIn a word -- nothing.\n\nGuggenheim analyst John DiFucci questioned the company's need to offer incentives \"when other companies embark on similar paths of consolidation without having to give away product for a time.\"\n\nJefferies analyst Joseph Gallo addressed spending fatigue, writing, \"While it's logical for cyber fatigue in Palo Alto's mega deals, we haven't heard this from anywhere else,\" suggesting this was a company-specific issue.\n\nIt seems like a stretch to suggest that competitors will suffer due to Palo Alto's shift in strategy.\n\nOn Tuesday, Zscaler scored two price target hikes from analysts. The first came courtesy of Truist, which maintained a buy rating on the stock and increased its price target to $260, which would equate to roughly 20% upside after Wednesday's plunge. The analyst noted that after discussions within the industry, demand seems to have stabilized \"despite the challenging macro environment.\" UBS was even more bullish, keeping a buy rating and boosting its price target to $300, or upside potential of roughly 40%. That analyst suggested the environment was more positive than the company's conservative guidance suggests.\n\nIn the wake of Palo Alto's results, Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci maintained a buy rating on SentinelOne shares while boosting its price target to $32, proposing potential upside of about 23%. The analyst said he expects another \"top-line beat and raise\" when the company reports early next month.\n\nGuggenheim was also bullish on CrowdStrike, with a buy rating and price target of $358, which would result in potential gains for investors of 23% from current levels. DiFucci believes CrowdStrike will \"grow faster and attain greater scale\" in the coming years, benefiting shareholders.\n\nThis is all a long way of suggesting that the fate of an industry doesn't rest on one company.\n\nTo be clear, none of these stocks is cheap by traditional valuation metrics. Cloudflare, CrowdStrike, and Zscaler currently trade at forward price-to-sales ratios of 15, 14, and 14, respectively, while Fortinet and SentinelOne each have forward price-to-sales ratios of 7.\n\nOf this quintet of stocks, CrowdStrike is the surest bet for my money. The company is still generating robust growth and has achieved the scale necessary to thrive.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

The solution was built to replace traditional data loss prevention tools.

FDP helps customers anticipate threats by simulating future scenarios, allowing cybersecurity teams to test policies beforehand to ensure effectiveness without disrupting end-user experiences prior to implementation.\n\nWith the general availability of these solutions businesses will now be able to merge the benefits of GenAI, Security and IT in one place. This integration will facilitate improved collaboration between analysts and engineers, enabling faster results derived from insights driven by data.\n\nThis announcement comes at a time when there\u2019s a rising demand for cyber security owing to the slew of data breaches amid the growing hybrid working trend that need off-premise computers to connect with the business\u2019s owned infrastructure.

        "title": "The Next Big Cybersecurity Threat: Artificial Intelligence (AI). 2 Stocks to Buy Right Now.",
        "content": "Each year, global consulting firm PwC surveys thousands of leading CEOs to gauge their temperature on the risks and opportunities facing their businesses. PwC just released the 27th edition of that survey, and it revealed some very useful insights about the world's most dominant technology trend right now: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nOf the 4,702 respondents, 64% believe generative AI will increase cybersecurity risks in their organization over the next 12 months. It was the leading concern as it relates to AI, outranking the spread of misinformation and the potential reputational risks it could cause.\n\nGenerative AI has the ability to create hyperrealistic emails for phishing scams, and it can even produce deep fake audio recordings designed to impersonate executives over the phone. These sneaky attacks are targeted at employees to convince them to click on malicious links or hand over sensitive information, and it's becoming harder for the average person to tell the difference between what's real and what isn't.\n\nAs a result, proactive and automated cybersecurity software is more critical than ever. Here's why Tenable (NASDAQ: TENB) and CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) will likely benefit significantly from the explosion in AI-based cyberattacks.\n\n1. Tenable is a leader in vulnerability management\n\nIgnoring cyber threats is no longer an option for companies that operate online. Deploying proactive cybersecurity tools to constantly identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited should be a core pillar of every cyber strategy. Tenable's Nessus platform is the most widely deployed vulnerability management tool in the cybersecurity industry.\n\nNessus actively scans operating systems, devices, and cloud networks looking for points of vulnerability that could be used by a malicious actor to launch an attack. It offers the broadest coverage of any tool of its kind, protecting against over 82,000 known common vulnerabilities and exposures -- and it's also the most accurate in identifying them.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Tenable has expanded far beyond Nessus. It offers a host of specific tools for advanced cloud protection, identity protection, and attack surface management, among others. It also offers a tool called ExposureAI, which uses generative AI to help security teams get a tighter grip on potential attack paths. It can find, explain, and recommend actions to limit exposures proactively.\n\nTenable serves more than 40,000 organizations worldwide. At the end of 2023, 1,721 of those customers were spending at least $100,000 per year on its products. That number grew by 21% compared to the year-ago period, which highlights the growing need for advanced cybersecurity in larger organizations.\n\nTenable delivered $798.7 million in revenue during 2023, which was up 17% year over year and comfortably above its prior forecast.\n\nBut that is a mere drop in the bucket compared to the company's addressable market, which it estimates will grow to $33 billion by 2027. Tenable stock is relatively cheap compared to many of its peers in the cybersecurity industry, and that makes it an enticing opportunity for investors.\n\n2. CrowdStrike is a leader in AI-powered cybersecurity\n\nAs I touched on earlier, employees are often the most vulnerable part of any organization when it comes to cyber threats. CrowdStrike estimates that 90% of all successful attacks originate at the endpoint -- the computer or device used by staff members to access emails, messaging platforms, and the broader internet.\n\nCrowdStrike is an endpoint protection specialist, but its flagship Falcon platform is a holistic solution for enterprises seeking full protection in the cloud and identity spheres, too (among others). AI is at the core of its software; as one of the largest cybersecurity providers in the world, CrowdStrike has an enormous, growing pool of data to draw upon to train its models.\n\nIn fact, the company's AI observes over 2 trillion security events per day, and it makes a mind-boggling 180 million indicator-of-attack (IoA) decisions every second. An example of an IoA is when an employee falls prey to an email phishing scam, which is often the first stage of a potential breach. Therefore, the more IoAs and events CrowdStrike observes through its customers, the smarter its AI becomes at autonomously preventing such occurrences.\n\nCrowdStrike will report its financial results for the fiscal 2024 full year (ended Jan. 31) next month. However, in the recent fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 31), the company's annual recurring revenue (ARR) surpassed $3 billion for the first time. There could be substantial growth on the horizon, though, because management has outlined a plan to more than triple its ARR to $10 billion within the next seven years.\n\nCrowdStrike shares are trading at an all-time high, but that shouldn't be surprising given the recent survey results out of PwC. The stock is relatively expensive at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 27.7 -- Tenable stock trades at one-third of that -- which is something investors should consider before buying.\n\nHowever, the need for CrowdStrike's AI-powered products will likely increase going forward, so investors with a time horizon of at least five years could potentially do very well by owning the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tenable right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tenable, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tenable wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2024 CrowdStrike Global Threat Report: From Breakout to Breach in Under Three Minutes; Cloud Infrastructure Under Attack",
        "content": "Report indicates adversaries seek to disrupt global elections and exploit generative AI technology\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, February 21, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD) today announced the findings of the 2024 CrowdStrike Global Threat Report, highlighting a surge in adversaries leveraging stolen identity credentials to exploit gaps in cloud environments and maximize the stealth, speed and impact of cyberattacks. The report also details the biggest threats on the horizon for 2024, including the disruption of global elections and the exploitation of generative AI to lower the barrier of entry and launch more sophisticated attacks.\n\nIn the 10th annual edition of the cybersecurity leader\u2019s seminal report, CrowdStrike highlights activity from some of the 230+ prolific threat groups that it tracks today. Key findings in the 2024 report include:\n\nDramatic Increase in Attack Velocity: The speed of cyberattacks continues to accelerate at an alarming rate. The report indicates that the average breakout time is down to only 62 minutes from 84 in the previous year (with the fastest recorded attack coming in at 2 minutes and 7 seconds). Once initial access was obtained, it took only 31 seconds for an adversary to drop initial discovery tools in an attempt to compromise victims. Stealthy Attacks Spike as Adversaries Compromise Credentials: The report notes a sharp increase in interactive intrusions and hands-on-keyboard activity (60%) as adversaries increasingly exploit stolen credentials to gain initial access at targeted organizations. Adversaries Follow as Business Moves to the Cloud: Adversaries turned their sights to the cloud through valid credentials \u2013 creating a challenge for defenders looking to differentiate between normal and malicious user behavior. The report shows cloud intrusions increased by 75% overall with cloud-conscious cases amplifying by 110% Year-over-Year. The Exploitation of Generative AI on the Horizon: In 2023, CrowdStrike observed nation-state actors and hacktivists experimenting with and seeking to abuse generative AI to democratize attacks and lower the barrier of entry for more sophisticated operations. The report highlights how generative AI will likely be used for cyber activities in 2024 as the technology continues to gain popularity. Disrupting Democracy by Targeting Global Elections: With more than 40 democratic elections scheduled in 2024, nation-state and eCrime adversaries will have numerous opportunities to disrupt the electoral process or sway voter opinion. Nation-state actors from China, Russia and Iran are highly likely to conduct mis- or disinformation operations to sow disruption against the backdrop of geoconflicts and global elections.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Over the course of 2023, CrowdStrike observed unprecedented stealthy operations from brazen eCrime groups, sophisticated nation-state actors and hacktivists targeting businesses in every sector spanning the globe. Rapidly evolving adversary tradecraft honed in on both cloud and identity with unheard of speed, while threat groups continued to experiment with new technologies, like GenAI, to increase the success and tempo of their malicious operations,\" said Adam Meyers, head of Counter Adversary Operations, CrowdStrike. \"To defeat relentless adversaries, organizations must embrace a platform-approach, fueled by threat intelligence and hunting, to protect identity, prioritize cloud protection, and give comprehensive visibility into areas of enterprise risk.\"\n\nAs the cybersecurity consolidator in the AI-era, CrowdStrike pioneered the adversary-focused approach to cybersecurity and provides customers with adversary-driven intelligence, human-led analysis and the groundbreaking technology required to stay ahead of threats. This unique approach combines the unparalleled power of CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Intelligence with CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae OverWatch\u2019s elite team of threat hunters to fuel the AI-native CrowdStrike XDR Falcon\u00ae platform to accelerate investigations, remediate threats and ultimately stop breaches.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nDownload the 2024 CrowdStrike Global Threat Report.

We stop breaches.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a simple way to describe the cybersecurity firm. While Crowdstrike moves faster than its adversaries, the corporation\u2019s stock price has moved even faster. The stock is up by 413% over the past five years and has almost tripled over the past year.\n\nIntuit (INTU) Intuit and turbotax logo on a phone screen on top of a keyboard. INTU stock.\n\nSource: Julio Ricco / Shutterstock\n\nIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) took a more straightforward approach with its Super Bowl commercial. This commercial is a case study of first-time homeowners who turned to Turbo Tax because they needed help with filing their taxes. Viewers get to see a Turbo Tax representative discuss what happened and how the first-time homeowners were assisted along the way.\n\nThe commercial comes to an end with Intuit mentioning Turbo Tax\u2019s 100% accuracy guarantee. It\u2019s a good and concise way to close out the commercial as it gives people another reason to feel comfortable with using the popular software.\n\nTurbo Tax isn\u2019t the only financial software under the Intuit umbrella. The company also owns several business software companies like Mailchimp. Intuit doesn\u2019t seem to get as much buzz as high-flying tech companies that are invested in AI. However, the stock has marched 62% higher over the past year and is up by 161% over the past five years. That\u2019s enough to outperform the major indices.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in MSFT.

        "title": "ChatGPT Stock Predictions: 3 Cybersecurity Companies the AI Bot Thinks Have 10X Potential",
        "content": "With artificial intelligence becoming increasingly ingrained in our daily lives, can the innovation pick out the best cybersecurity stocks for robust returns? I\u2019m eager to find out!\n\nHeading over to ChatGPT, I asked the digital intelligence platform to provide me with cybersecurity stocks that have \u201cserious upside potential,\u201d mentioning the 10X target. Given the limitations for AI stock predictions, I wasn\u2019t caught off guard with its suggestions. If anything, I was a bit bored.\n\nNevertheless, I simply wanted an answer to my inquiry without attempting to shake it down until I heard something I wanted to hear; otherwise, what would be the point? With that in mind, let\u2019s explore AI\u2019s top choices for cybersecurity stocks with serious upside potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leading provider of cloud-native endpoint security solutions. Further, its platform offers advanced threat protection, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and threat intelligence services to enterprises and organizations worldwide. Due to the rising frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, CrowdStrike\u2019s innovative approach could position CRWD stock for long-term growth.\n\nPressing the intelligent chatbot for more information, it stated that CrowdStrike enjoys a strong growth trajectory. Since its inception, it has consistently posted strong financial metrics and has expanded its market share. Looking at the numbers myself, it\u2019s definitely onto something. Right now, CrowdStrike prints a 43.5% three-year revenue growth rate. That\u2019s much better than most other cybersecurity stocks.\n\nNow, the challenge that clouds CRWD is that while analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy, the average price target sits at $300.42. From the time of writing, the estimate implies a loss of more than 9%. That\u2019s not surprising given the 90.2X forward earnings multiple.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the high-side price target lands at $375, implying over 13% upside. If by 10X returns you meant 1.10X, CRWD is your investment. Still, as a long-term idea, it\u2019s not bad for AI stock predictions.\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nI don\u2019t fault ChatGPT for this idea one bit because how it could possibly know? But I wouldn\u2019t necessarily shower Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) as a 10X opportunity. Why? Since the beginning of the year, ZS already gained over 19% of market value. In the past 52 weeks, it\u2019s up over 90% or nearly double. That\u2019s not a great recipe for buying low and selling high.\n\nStill, ChatGPT remarks that it could be one of the top cybersecurity stocks due to its cloud security mechanisms. Per the chatbot, the company\u2019s platform features a zero-trust security architecture. Via Zscaler\u2019s website, zero trust represents a protocol that no entity should be trusted by default. Such a standard should prevent the weakest link from imposing vulnerabilities on the entire chain.\n\nLooking at this particular context, the narrative becomes clear. With more businesses adopting cloud-based technologies, it\u2019s vital to shore up any vulnerabilities. As well, remote work protocols could represent a nightmare for organizational security.\n\nAnalysts rate shares a strong buy. However, the average price target sits at $244.27, implying almost 4% downside from where I am. In fairness, though, the high-side target is $311, implying 23% upside. Again, that\u2019s decent for AI stock predictions.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo be quite blunt, I was nervous that ChatGPT would select Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). It wasn\u2019t to the level of Milli Vanilli winning a Grammy or anything like that. Still, PANW stock carries the same disadvantage that Zscaler does, just worse. On a year-to-date basis, Palo Alto shares gained just under 27%. In the trailing year, the enterprise returned shareholders over 113%.\n\nSo, can the fire keep burning? It\u2019s unfair to put this on ChatGPT. However, from a longer-term framework, Palo Alto\u2019s comprehensive suite of cybersecurity solutions \u2013 including firewall, cloud security, endpoint protection and threat intelligence services \u2013 should help spark gradual upside interest. Let\u2019s face it, nefarious actors won\u2019t ever stop their activities. The only way cyberthreats cease is if the internet fails altogether. We don\u2019t want that.\n\nIn that sense, PANW and the other top-tier ideas are permanently relevant cybersecurity stocks. As you might imagine, analysts also rate shares a strong buy. However, the average price target of $356.63 basically calls for 3% downside risk. However, the most optimistic target aims for $450, which would be about 23% up.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Shares of CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) have surged to new highs this year, but analysts at HSBC think the cybersecurity specialist has more in the tank. The bank's financial services firm recently adjusted its price target to $411, representing an upside of 25% from the current share price of $329.\n\nThe firm initially rated the stock a buy in September when the shares traded around $165. Since then, CrowdStrike has reported solid growth as companies continue to view cybersecurity as a must-have in today's environment.\n\nIs CrowdStrike a good long-term buy?\n\nIt's unclear exactly what prompted the price target raise, but Wall Street analysts are constantly adjusting price targets to reflect a stock's recent performance, and that's probably all that was going on in this case. Still, CrowdStrike has achieved strong, profitable growth that is deserving of a rising stock price.\n\nRevenue grew 35% year over year in the October-ending quarter. Annual recurring revenue reached a record $3.15 billion, which shows the company gaining scale and all the benefits it accrues to profitability. Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled year over year to $0.82. Image source: CrowdStrike.\n\nMoreover, CrowdStrike said it achieved a perfect score in visibility, protection, and analytics detections in MITRE's testing. This explains a lot of the growth it is experiencing right now.\n\nIt's also notable that CrowdStrike reported accelerating growth in cloud security -- a market expected to reach $68 billion in value by 2028, according to MarketsandMarkets.\n\nInvestors should expect the stock to pull back at some point after a sharp rise. The shares do trade at an expensive valuation compared to others in the industry. But CrowdStrike is showing a lot of strength in a competitive field that makes it one of the best cybersecurity stocks to own for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks That Could More Than Triple Their Revenue by 2030",
        "content": "Rising interest rates and other macro headwinds drove many investors away from hypergrowth stocks over the past two years. However, that sell-off also compressed many of those stocks' valuations to more sustainable levels.\n\nTherefore, investors who can tune out the near-term noise should consider investing in a few companies that could at least triple their annual revenues by the end of the decade. These three volatile growth stocks fit that description: Lucid Group(NASDAQ: LCID), Symbotic(NASDAQ: SYM), and CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD). Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Lucid Group\n\nLucid's stock has declined nearly 90% since the company went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition (SPAC) company in 2021. The luxury electric vehicle (EV) maker quickly ran out of juice as it broadly missed its own production targets.\n\nAfter initially claiming it could produce 20,000 Air sedans in 2022 and 49,000 sedans in 2023, it only pumped out 7,180 sedans in 2022 and 8,428 sedans in 2023. It blamed that painfully sluggish start on supply chain constraints and other macro headwinds, but it believes it can significantly ramp up its production as it expands its AMP-1 plant in Arizona and its new AMP-2 plant in Saudi Arabia. It also plans to roll out its second vehicle, the Gravity SUV, this year.\n\nLucid is still firmly backed by the Saudi Arabian government, which owns more than 60% of its shares through its Public Investment Fund (PIF). Analysts also expect its revenue to soar at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 148% from $618 million in 2023 to $3.8 billion in 2025 -- so it could be significantly undervalued right now at 6 times next year's sales. Lucid is still deeply unprofitable, but it says it has enough cash to last through 2025. If it successfully ramps up its production, its revenue could surge even higher from 2025 to 2030 and drive its stock toward big multibagger gains.\n\n2. Symbotic\n\nSymbotic provides warehouse automation services for large retailers. It claims the installation of just one of its $50 million modules (which bundle together its robots and software) can generate $250 million in lifetime savings over 25 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nSymbotic notably generated 88% of its revenue from Walmart, which is also one of its top investors, in fiscal 2023 (which ended last September). However, it's gradually expanding beyond Walmart by signing new automation deals with other big customers like Target, Albertsons, C&S Wholesale, and GreenBox -- a new warehouse-as-a-service joint venture it formed with its other big backer SoftBank. That growing list of partnerships could help it establish a meaningful lead in the fragmented warehouse automation market.\n\nSymbotic also went public by merging with a SPAC, but its stock has soared 130% since its first trading day in 2022. Its stock doesn't look cheap at 15 times this year's sales, but it could have plenty of upside potential. Analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 44% from $1.2 billion in fiscal 2023 to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2026, and it could have even more room to run as more retailers fully automate their warehouses.\n\n3. CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that only provides cloud-native security services. That disruptive approach eliminates the need for on-site appliances, which are generally expensive, take up a lot of space, require constant maintenance, and are difficult to scale as an organization expands.\n\nCrowdStrike's first-mover advantage in the cloud-native security space has enabled it to grow like a weed since its IPO in 2019. From fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last January), its revenue grew at a CAGR of 80%. Analysts expect its revenue to increase at a CAGR of 31% from $2.2 billion in fiscal 2023 to $5.0 billion in fiscal 2026.\n\nThat growth is being driven by its market share gains and the rising adoption of its cloud-based modules. In its latest quarter, 42% of its customers had already adopted at least six of its modules, compared to just 36% of its customers a year ago.\n\nEven if CrowdStrike continues to grow at a more modest CAGR of 25% from fiscal 2026 to fiscal 2030, it could generate more than $12 billion in revenue by the final year. It will also likely inorganically expand its ecosystem of cloud-based services by gobbling up even more companies. Its profitability has also been improving as its revenue growth cools off.\n\nCrowdStrike's stock has soared nearly 190% over the past 12 months and might seem a bit pricey at 20 times next year's sales, but its dominance of the cloud-native cybersecurity space justifies that premium valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Symbotic right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Symbotic, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Symbotic wasn\u2019t one of them.

If the selection process is done right, you'll end up with a bunch of growth stocks that can continue to power ahead year after year, allowing you to compound your wealth and better prepare you for retirement. Buying and holding these stocks is the key to achieving long-term wealth as their share prices continue marching higher.\n\nGrowth stocks that will do well include businesses with catalysts that can propel their revenue and free cash flow higher. They should also possess a strong competitive moat and a sticky customer base that allows them to continue to do well. Let's dig deeper into three growth stocks that could surge this year based on their financial results, business developments, and prospects. Image source: Getty images.\n\nCrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) is a cybersecurity company that offers an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven platform to spot cyber threats and boost its clients' online security. With digitalization being a key driving force for change in many organizations, the need for cybersecurity and threat protection represents a strong tailwind. CrowdStrike's recent financial results for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, ending Oct. 31, demonstrate the business' rapid growth. Total revenue jumped 37.8% from a year ago to $2.2 billion, with subscription revenue making up 94% of the total. Gross profit increased by 41.1% to $1.7 billion, as gross margin improved from 73.5% a year ago to 75.2%. The business also generated a positive free cash flow of $656.6 million for the first nine months, 40% higher than the $467.4 million in the comparative prior year.\n\nSubscription annual recurring revenue has been climbing steadily, too, hitting a new high of $3.2 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 for 35% year-over-year growth. That's more than six times the recurring revenue booked just four years ago and is testament to how rapidly CrowdStrike increased both its bookings and customer base. Sixty-three percent of its customers use five or more modules on its platform, while slightly more than a quarter use seven or more modules, showcasing the success of the software-as-a-service company's land and expand strategy. Management estimates that the total addressable market for AI-native security platforms is around $100 billion in the calendar year 2024, and that figure will rise to $225 billion by calendar year 2028. With such a massive addressable market, CrowdStrike should enjoy a long growth runway that will last for many more years.\n\nStory continues\n\nWorkday\n\nWorkday(NASDAQ: WDAY) offers its cloud application for finance and human resources functions with analytics embedded with AI and machine learning. The business also boasts more than 10,000 global customers operating in more than 175 countries, and it serves 70% of the top 50 Fortune 500 companies, demonstrating its broad reach and appeal. Total revenue for the first nine months of 2024 rose 16.8% from a year ago to $5.3 billion, of which subscription services made up 90.7%, or $4.8 billion. The company also generated net income of $192.5 million, reversing the net loss of $241.1 million in the prior year. Free cash flow for the first nine months amounted to $972.3 million, 44% higher than the $676.7 million from a year ago.\n\nWorkday continues to enhance its cloud offering with the introduction of AI updates such as generative AI capabilities and a manager insight hub that offers managers automated insights for overseeing their teams. The company also released a new Workday AI Marketplace to help customers locate and launch trusted AI apps within the platform's ecosystem. Just this month, Workday announced a collaboration with Insperity to jointly develop, brand, and market a comprehensive human resources solution for small and medium-sized companies. The company believes it has a total addressable market of around $142 billion, giving the business ample opportunities to capture more business and grow its top and bottom lines.\n\nNetflix\n\nNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) is a market leader in streaming services and boasts a wide slate of movies and TV series catering to audiences around the world. The company reported a rise in revenue, profitability, and free cash flow for 2023. Revenue rose 6.7% year over year to $33.7 billion, with operating income climbing 23.5% year over year to $6.9 billion. Net income came in at $5.4 billion for the year, up 20.4% year over year. Netflix saw a big surge in free cash flow generation at $6.9 billion for 2023, up more than fourfold year over year from just $1.6 billion in 2022. Membership levels hit a new high of 260.3 million, up close to 13% year over year, as Netflix's portfolio of movies and TV series continued to attract customers from all over the globe.\n\nThere could be more to come for the streaming company this year. Netflix sees a $600 billion revenue opportunity across pay TV, film, games, and branded advertising, but the business makes up only around 5% of this addressable market. TV viewing is still less than 10% in each country, representing a significant untapped opportunity to increase Netflix's reach. The company is also well known for its new, original TV series and the large audiences that gravitate toward some of these titles, allowing Netflix to take the top spot for original TV series and film for 48 and 41 out of 52 weeks, respectively, in 2023.\n\nThe streaming TV giant makes use of analytics to understand its customers' preferences and keep them coming back, thereby generating higher retention and also recommending the service to their friends, increasing acquisition.\n\nNetflix can periodically raise its prices to drive additional investment to broaden its slate of movies and TV shows while its advertisement tier is catching on quickly, accounting for 40% of new signups in the ad markets it's targeting. Account sharing has also been nipped in the bud, with the business seeing many more customers signing up for their accounts.\n\nNetflix sees a near-term addressable market of around 500 million connected TV users, excluding China and Russia, that should continue to grow as broadband penetration increases around the world.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "On Feb. 9, the S&P 500 closed above 5,000 for the first time ever. Optimism around artificial intelligence (AI) has been a significant catalyst, with stocks like Nvidia leading the market higher. But Nvidia isn't your only option. Here are three other AI stocks worth considering right now.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMy first pick is the largest company in the world by market cap: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nWhat makes Microsoft stand out in the AI crowd right now is how quickly the company is bringing AI advancements to market. Thanks to its long-standing partnership with OpenAI, the company integrated ChatGPT features into its Bing search engine and Edge internet browser more than a year ago.\n\nAnd while some people might dismiss the company's search and related ad business, that's a mistake, because by any normal business measure, Microsoft's search business is enormous.\n\nFor example, in its latest quarter (the three months ending Dec. 31), Microsoft generated $3.2 billion from search and its news feed's advertising business. That's about the same as the quarterly revenue of Domino's Pizza, Pinterest, CrowdStrikeHoldings(NASDAQ: CRWD), and DraftKings combined.\n\nAnd search is just one area where Microsoft is incorporating new AI features. The company has also debuted its new AI-powered Copilot \"everyday AI companion.\" By purchasing a subscription, users can access generative AI features to help improve and streamline tasks like summarizing and replying to email and building charts and graphs.\n\nIn short, Microsoft is probably doing more than any other company to bring AI to the public, creating yet another competitive advantage for the world's most valuable company.\n\n2. CrowdStrike Holdings\n\nNext up is CrowdStrike Holdings, the company behind one of the most popular AI-powered cybersecurity platforms.\n\nCrowdStrike's signature offering is the Falcon platform, a scalable, dynamic endpoint security solution. Organizations can purchase multiple security modules depending on their needs and budget.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancially, CrowdStrike is right where a young company early in its life cycle should be. It is growing fast and generating ample free cash flow.\n\nRevenue in its most recent quarter (ending on Oct. 31, 2023), jumped 35% to $786 million. Free cash flow over the last 12 months has increased to $864 million. And the company's customer count has grown 35% year over year. CRWD Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nCRWD free cash flow, data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nGranted, CrowdStrike's lofty price-to-sales multiple of 28 makes it an expensive stock. Yet for long-term, growth-oriented investors, it's a name to remember.\n\n3. Super Micro Computer\n\nLastly, let's talk about one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street: SuperMicroComputer (NASDAQ: SMCI).\n\nUp 171% year to date as of this writing, Super Micro Computer is firing on all cylinders thanks to the AI revolution.\n\nThe reason is that the company makes server racks, the physical hardware used in data centers to hold, cool, and store the cutting-edge AI chips made by Nvidia, AMD, and others.\n\nSince cloud giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon are buying AI chips at lightning speed, the demand for server racks is also through the roof. In fact, analysts estimate that the company's sales will more than double in 2024 to $14.5 billion, with a 34% jump expected in 2025. SMCI Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nNevertheless, this isn't a stock for everyone. Given how quickly shares have skyrocketed, the stock's valuation -- a price-to-earnings multiple of 58 -- puts it well out of consideration for value investors.\n\nHowever, for those looking for a company that will benefit from the growth of physical AI infrastructure and data centers, Super Micro Computer is a stock to consider.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leading cloud-native endpoint security platform. While other companies have just begun integrating AI, this security company has been doing so for a decade. Its Falcon platform utilizes advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning to offer real-time threat detection and automated responses.\n\nAs cyber threats evolve in complexity and frequency, Crowdstrike has become a critical defense for businesses worldwide. It has positioned itself as the AI-native security platform. Today, it serves several cyber end markets, including endpoint security, security and IT operations, observability, managed services, cloud security and identity protection.\n\nStory continues\n\nDue to its leadership in cloud endpoint security, it has seen a rapid expansion in its customer base. Moreover, it has a high retention rate and earns more revenues as customers adopt more Falcon modules. New customers, plus the land and expand model that leads to additional subscriptions to more Falcon modules, have brought tremendous success. Subscription annual recurring revenue has grown from $71 million in Q1 fiscal year 2018 to $3.15 billion in Q3 FY2024.\n\nCRWD stock is soaring with subscription revenue growth in the first three-quarters of FY2024, up 37%. Yet despite these astonishing growth numbers, management expects to maintain this momentum. Their optimism is buttressed by a growing total addressable market, which they expect to grow from $100 billion to $225 billion in 2028.\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs usual, Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) reported another impressive quarterly report on Feb. 13. Revenues rose 26% year-over-year to $589.6 million. Initially, the stock sold off but has recovered those losses. Any weakness in this stock for growth is an opportunity to buy.\n\nOver the past five years, Datadog has cemented its leading position in cloud-scale monitoring and analytics. It provides an integrated platform that monitors servers, databases, tools and services through a software-as-a-service data analytics platform. Its platform enables companies to improve operational performance and ensure the high availability of their services.\n\nAs companies migrate to cloud computing, the demand for Datadog\u2019s services is expected to surge. The International Data Corporation (IDC) projects that cloud spending growth will average 19.9% annually through 2027. Datadog will capture part of these cloud budgets, given its comprehensive monitoring solutions across cloud providers, servers, databases and applications.\n\nDigging into the latest results, it\u2019s clear that this stock for growth isn\u2019t slowing down. Besides the 26% revenue growth, customer growth was also impressive. Customers with an ARR of $1 million or more increased from 317 in 2022 to 396 as of Dec. 31, 2023. Over the same period, customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more increased from 2,780 to 3,190, a 15% increase.\n\nDatadog\u2019s growth is backed by the secular shift from on-premises to the cloud. Management expects revenue of $2.555-$2.575 billion in FY2024, representing at least 19.9% growth. The company has always surprised to the upside and will do so again.\n\nXP (XP) Light bulb on tablet and Stock graph and business technology icon with abstract electronic circuit background. best fintech stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nXP (NASDAQ:XP) is a leading technology-driven financial services platform transforming Brazil\u2019s financial landscape.

        "content": "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index was one of the best-performing exchanges in 2023. Just six weeks into 2024, it may be headed for a repeat performance. The index is up approximately 7% and the story is the same for the top tech stocks. That means a focus on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nIn 2023, companies made a point of telling investors about their AI capabilities. In 2024, investors are being more discerning about AI. Specifically, they want to know how companies are going to use AI to increase profits.\n\nThat narrows the list a little bit. But as the early returns show, there are still several companies to choose from. Here are three of the top tech stocks that have posted strong returns in the last 12 months.

And that growth isn\u2019t expected to slow down anytime soon.\n\nPLTR stock is up 40% in 2024 and 160% in the last 12 months. So, it\u2019s not like it needed much help from bullish earnings. And there are many analysts saying the time may come for a pullback.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, I agree. I tend to take a long-term outlook based on fundamentals. However, after each of its last two earnings reports, PLTR stock has had a pullback of around 15-20%. Will lightning strike a third time? Possibly, but it shouldn\u2019t be something that concerns long-term investors.\n\nThat\u2019s because Palantir continues to silence its critics. First, it didn\u2019t have any commercial clients. Now it has over 20 major partners including companies AWS and Google Cloud. Palantir increased its commercial revenue by 70% year-over-year and is guiding for 40% growth in its commercial sector this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd the reason for that is what the company calls unprecedented demand for its artificial intelligence platform. Maintaining that demand will be the key to justifying the company\u2019s eye-popping valuation which appears to be the next objection for the company to overcome.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou could easily put Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) on a list of top tech stocks, but Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) may be a (slightly) better option for 2024. The reason comes down to supply and demand. Nvidia simply can\u2019t meet the insatiable demand for its AI chips.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD recently released its own MI100 AI chips. At launch, the company projected $2 billion in sales for the year. However, on the earnings call, CEO Lisa Siu increased the forecast to $3.5 billion, and analysts believe that may be too conservative.\n\nAlthough AMD stock is nearing the top of its current consensus price target. But the key word there is current. Analysts have been increasing their price targets since the earnings report and if the company keeps capturing market share fueled by increasing demand, it\u2019s not hard to see the stock flirting with a $200 price target by the end of the year. As it is, AMD stock is finding solid support around $168 since the earnings report.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity makes this list of top tech stocks for the way it showcases both sides of the AI coin. On the one hand, artificial intelligence will create more ways for bad actors to try to breach protected information. On the other hand, companies like CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) are using AI as part of its cybersecurity platform as an extra layer of protection.\n\nThe question investors have to ask is how much is that worth? Revenue and earnings are growing strongly YOY. And about $3 billion of that revenue was of the recurring variety that shareholders love. But with a stock price that\u2019s up 180% in the last 12 months and 30% so far in 2024, it\u2019s fair to ask if all that growth is priced in.\n\nHowever, the company is getting ready to report earnings on March 5, 2024. And ahead of that report, analysts are starting to raise their price targets for CRWD strike.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in PLTR.

Low liquidity remains a concern.\n\nAMETEK (AME) Rides on Acquisition Benefits & Organic Growth\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Navitar, Alphasense, Magnetrol International, and Crank Software buyouts are aiding AMETEK's Electronic Instruments unit. Strong organic growth continues to drive the top-line.\n\nEngine Products Unit Benefits Howmet (HWM) Amid Rising Costs\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Howmet's Engine Products unit is driven by strength in the commercial aerospace, defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets. High operating costs remain a concern.\n\nTractor Supply's (TSCO) Life Out Here Strategy Bodes Well\r\nPer Zacks analyst, Tractor Supply's Life Out Here Strategy is contributing to its performance. This strategy focuses on customers, digitization, execution, team members and total shareholder return.\n\nRestructuring Initiatives Aid Mohawk (MHK), High Costs Ail\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Mohawk is benefiting from restructuring initiatives, bolt-on acquisitions and low input costs. However, residential sector softness, and high costs and expenses hurt prospects.\n\nLoan, Rates Aid Valley National (VLY), Strain on NIM A Woe\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, strategic buyouts, decent loan balance and high interest rates will aid Valley National's financials. Yet, elevated costs, pressure on NIM and commercial loan exposure are woes.\n\nNew Upgrades\n\nWatts Water (WTS) To Benefit From Strong Product Portfolio\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, WTS will benefit from product development, geographic expansion and efficient cost management.

        "title": "Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting: 3 Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "We're halfway through the second month of the year, and Cathie Wood has a lot of ground to make up. The Ark Invest founder, CEO, and ace investor finds her largest exchange-traded fund trading lower in 2024, even after a 5% surge on Wednesday.\n\nShe's still making moves, lately adding to some of her biggest gainers over the past year. Wood added to existing stakes in CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Archer Aviation(NYSE: ACHR) on Wednesday. Let's take a closer look.\n\n1. CrowdStrike Holdings\n\nCathie Wood's funds may be lower this year, but you can't blame CrowdStrike. The cybersecurity specialist has seen its shares soar 31% so far this year, and that's on top of more than doubling in 2023.\n\nAnalysts are struggling to keep up. Eric Heath at Keybanc bumped his price target from $245 to $318 a month ago. On Wednesday, he jacked up that price goal to $375. It's a 53% overall hike in less than four weeks. He's naturally sticking to his overweight rating. Heath is upbeat about the fiscal fourth quarter CrowdStrike will discuss on March 5, backed by strong channel checks for its endpoint security and identity protection products. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIt's a good time for CrowdStrike's Falcon line of cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. Companies need to protect their sites and their customers, and you can't skimp on your reputation. Revenue rose 34% in its fiscal third quarter, ahead of expectations. Adjusted earnings soared 85%, trouncing Wall Street projections by at least 9% for the fourth period in a row.\n\nCrowdStrike is also now profitable on a reported basis. Its guidance calls for 32% revenue growth in next month's fiscal first-quarter report, but the market has seen a steady string of \"beat and raise\" performances here. Expectations may be high, but reality has been even higher for CrowdStrike these days.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta was another big winner of 2023 that Wood was buying up on Wednesday. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp has seen its stock nearly quadruple since the start of last year. The crazy thing is that the stock is still somehow reasonably cheap.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta ended 2022 on a rough note, with top-line declines in the final three quarters. Revenue growth turned positive last year, accelerating every single quarter of 2023. The top line isn't the only thing moving higher. Wall Street continues to paint rosier portraits of the social media giant with every financial checkpoint.\n\nThree months ago, analysts figured that Meta would earn $16.03 a share this new year and $18.78 a share next year. Those targets now stand at $19.92 and $22.96, respectively. Despite almost soaring fourfold since revenue growth turned positive, Meta is trading at a reasonable 21 times earnings. Put another way, you could've bought Meta at the beginning of 2023 for just a little more than 5 times what analysts now see it earning next year.\n\n3. Archer Aviation\n\nWood is flying high on electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVOTL) aircraft upstarts. She owns significant positions in a couple of them, but Archer Aviation is one of her favorites. She now owns more than 9% of the company's total shares outstanding.\n\nArcher won't be profitable anytime soon. It's going to take years before it generates meaningful revenue. That doesn't mean the stock isn't moving on news. Archer keeps scoring partnership deals and other wins as it builds out its next-generation fleet of air taxis. Two weeks ago, it announced it had completed its Midnight aircraft's first phase of the flight test program. This will still take years to play out, but momentum is building in its favor. Like CrowdStrike and Meta, Archer has more than doubled since the start of last year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In the dynamic media landscape where adaptability and digitization have become paramount, The New York Times Company NYT stands out as a beacon of innovation. Despite operational challenges, the company has not just survived but thrived, thanks to its expanding subscriber base and strategic transformation efforts. NYT's success lies in its commitment to diversifying revenue streams, optimizing expenses and streamlining operations. Its focus on bundled subscriptions reflects a smart response to changing reader preferences.\r\n\r\nBy embracing technology, The New York Times Company has cultivated strong connections with its audience. Through strategic acquisitions such as Wirecutter and The Athletic, the company has expanded its reach, tapping into new markets and engaging wider audiences. These moves highlight NYT\u2019s agility, ensuring they remain relevant and connected with their readership.\n\nImpressive Subscriber Growth\n\nThe New York Times Company concluded the fourth quarter of 2023 with roughly 10.36 million subscribers across its print and digital products, including roughly 9.7 million digital-only subscribers. Of the 9.7 million subscribers, about 4.22 million were bundle and multiproduct subscribers. There was a net increase of 880,000 in digital-only subscribers compared with the fourth quarter of 2022.\r\n\r\nSubscription revenues of $430.4 million grew 3.9% year over year. Subscription revenues from digital-only products jumped 7.2% to $288.7 million. This reflects an increase in bundle and multiproduct revenues and a rise in other single-product subscription revenues.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, The New York Times Company achieved consistent growth in its digital-only average revenue per user (ARPU). The ARPU increased to an impressive $9.24 in the final quarter from $8.93 in the year-ago period. This increase in ARPU can be attributed to subscribers transitioning from promotional pricing to higher rate plans and the introduction of price hikes for tenured non-bundle subscribers.\r\n\r\nManagement envisions first-quarter 2024 total subscription revenues to increase about 7-9%, with digital-only subscription revenues anticipated to rise approximately 11-14%.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWith rapid digitization in the core areas of advertising and readers increasingly gravitating toward online sources, newspaper companies have been reallocating resources to focus on online publications. The New York Times Company has demonstrated unwavering attempts to rapidly acclimatize to the changing face of the multiplatform media industry. For the first quarter of 2024, The New York Times Company foresees a low-to-high-single-digit jump in digital advertising revenues.\r\n\r\nShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have advanced 11.5% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 9.9%.\n\n3 Stocks Worth Looking\n\nSome better-ranked stocks are CrowdStrike Holdings CRWD, Meta Platforms META and StoneCo Ltd.

        "title": "Potential Stock Splits in 2024: 2 Monster Growth Stocks Up More Than 400% and 1,000% in 4 Years to Buy Now",
        "content": "Share prices of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) soared more than 1,000% and 400%, respectively, over the last four years. Those monster gains make the companies stock-split candidates in 2024, but both are worthwhile investments whether or not those splits happen.\n\nA survey from Morgan Stanley identified artificial intelligence (AI) as the most highly prioritized IT spending category in 2024. Nvidia and CrowdStrike are both positioned to benefit as businesses lean into automation. The survey also identified security software as the third-largest IT spending priority this year. That means endpoint security specialist CrowdStrike actually sits at the intersection of two powerful trends.\n\nHere's why long-term investors should consider buying these two monster growth stocks.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia is an accelerated computing company. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to render ultra-realistic visual effects in video games and other multimedia. They are also used to accelerate processing for compute-intensive data center applications like artificial intelligence. Nvidia dominates both markets. Its GPUs account for more than 95% of workstation graphics processors, and 80% to 95% of machine learning chips as measured by sales.\n\nNvidia has extended its ability to monetize AI with data center networking equipment and central processing units, both purpose-built for AI. It has also delved into cloud infrastructure and subscription software services with DGX Cloud, a platform that streamlines AI application development across use cases like video analytics, autonomous machines, and intelligent avatars. DGX Cloud also supports the development of generative AI applications.\n\nThe ability to blend hardware, software, and services gives Nvidia an immense competitive advantage.\n\n\"Nvidia stands out, in our view, not only because it participates in so many parts of the dynamic AI economy, but because it has synthesized its offerings into a first-of-its-kind AI-as-a-service delivered through the cloud,\" Argus analyst Jim Kelleher recently wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia reported stunning results in the third quarter. Its revenue jumped 206% to $18.1 billion on record data center sales, and non-GAAP net income increased sixfold to $10 billion due to margin expansion driven by pricing power and a mix shift toward more profitable data center products. Even so, Nvidia has hardly begun to tap what management sees as a $1 trillion addressable market.\n\nGrand View Research forecasts that the GPU market will grow at an annualized rate of 28% through 2030, and the AI market is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 37% during the same period. Nvidia's sales growth should be somewhere between those figures, but its bottom line should grow more quickly as high-margin software and services account for an increasing share of its revenue.\n\nIndeed, Wall Street expects Nvidia's earnings per share to grow by 81% annually over the next five years. In that context, its present valuation of 95.1 times earnings actually seems reasonable. Of course, the story would change quickly if Nvidia fails to meet those earnings growth expectations, but long-term investors comfortable with that risk should consider opening a small position in this stock today.\n\n2. CrowdStrike Holdings\n\nCrowdStrike is a cybersecurity software and services vendor. Its portfolio includes more than two dozen applications that cover several large security markets, playing into the growing demand for solutions that support vendor consolidation. Organizations are increasingly eager to reduce the costs and complexity of their cybersecurity systems by unifying the workflows on a single platform. CrowdStrike is ideally situated to benefit from that trend.\n\nIts platform packs superior AI and provides unparalleled threat protection, according to consultancy Frost & Sullivan. Those selling points have helped the company earn a leadership position in several software verticals, including endpoint security, cloud security, and managed detection and response. That gives CrowdStrike access to unique data that improves its AI, creating a network effect that enhances its protection capabilities.\n\nCrowdStrike reported solid financial results in the third quarter, though economic headwinds and pessimism continued to drag on business spending. Revenue increased 35% to $786 million on strong demand for endpoint security solutions, and there was encouraging momentum in cloud security, identity, and security operations products. The company also reported record GAAP net income of $27 million, its third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability.\n\nRapid innovation has kept CrowdStrike on the cutting edge of security software for years, and the company is still steaming along. It recently announced new modules for IT automation, data protection, and exposure management. CrowdStrike also launched a beta version of Charlotte AI, a natural language assistant. Those products widen its addressable market and strengthen its status as a vendor consolidator.\n\nWall Street expects annualized sales growth of 30% over the next five years. Admittedly, the stock still looks pricey at 27.8 times sales, but patient investors comfortable with volatility should also feel comfortable opening a small position today. CrowdStrike is a leader in several cybersecurity markets, and demand for its software and services should trend higher in the years ahead, given the rising costs and prevalence of cybercrime. That should translate into market-beating returns for patient shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "New office cements CrowdStrike\u2019s commitment to provide industry leading protection to organizations in India and the broader region\n\nPUNE, India, February 15, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD) today announced the opening of its new, state-of-the-art office in Pune, India, significantly strengthening the company\u2019s presence in the region. The new, 52,000 square foot facility nearly doubles the capacity of previous facilities in Pune, cementing the cybersecurity leader\u2019s commitment to protecting organizations in India and across the region.\n\nHeadquartered in the U.S. with global operations, CrowdStrike is one of the fastest growing and most innovative security companies in the world.

        "title": "Better Cybersecurity Stock: Fortinet vs. CrowdStrike",
        "content": "Fortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT) and CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) represent two very different ways to invest in the growing cybersecurity sector. Fortinet provides next-gen firewalls and end-to-end security tools through a mix of on-site appliances, first-party software, and cloud-based services. CrowdStrike eschews on-site appliances and only provides its cybersecurity tools as services through its cloud-based Falcon platform.\n\nFortinet is the older cybersecurity company, but it differentiates itself from its competitors by developing its own proprietary chips. It claims that pairing its first-party chips with its own hardware and software enables it to tackle threats more efficiently than other companies that use off-the-shelf chips. Meanwhile, CrowdStrike is the newer challenger, and aims to eliminate the need for on-site appliances -- which are pricier, take up more space, and are more difficult to scale than cloud-based services. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBoth stocks have generated massive gains since their IPOs. But over the past 12 months, Fortinet's stock only rose 22% as CrowdStrike's stock soared 190%. Let's see why CrowdStrike outperformed Fortinet, and if it's still the better buy right now.\n\nFortinet faces a near-term slowdown\n\nFrom 2017 to 2022, Fortinet's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24%, and its billings rose at a CAGR of 25%. But in 2023, its revenue and billings only increased 20% and 14%, respectively.\n\nThat slowdown was caused by three major challenges. First, many of its customers ramped up their hardware spending in 2022 in response to the supply chain constraints of 2021, but that temporary spending boost fizzled out in 2023. Second, the upgrade cycle for next-gen firewall products cooled off throughout the year. Lastly, the macro headwinds drove many companies to rein in their spending on big cybersecurity upgrades.\n\nFor 2024, Fortinet expects its revenue to rise just 8%-10% as its billings grow 0%-3%. On the bright side, it expects its top-line growth to stabilize again in the second half of 2024 and throughout 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts expect its revenue to rise 9% in 2024 and grow 14% to $6.6 billion in 2025. But during an analyst day presentation in May 2022, Fortinet boldly claimed it could generate $8 billion in annual revenue by 2025.\n\nFortinet also expects its adjusted EPS to grow just 1%-4% in 2024, which is below analysts' expectations for 5% growth, as its revenue growth slows down and it ramps up its spending on its first-party chips. Analysts expect its earnings to rise 14% in 2025 as its growth accelerates again, but its stock isn't cheap at 41 times forward earnings.\n\nCrowdStrike is still firing on all cylinders\n\nCrowdStrike's revenue grew at a jaw-dropping CAGR of 80% from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last January). That growth was driven by its rapid growth in large customers and rising adoption rates for its cloud-based modules.\n\nCrowdStrike faced some of the same macro headwinds as Fortinet, but its revenue still rose 54% in fiscal 2023, and it expects 36% growth in fiscal 2024. Analysts expect its revenue to rise another 29% to $3.9 billion in fiscal 2025.\n\nCrowdStrike's growth is cooling off, but its customers continue to adopt more of its modules. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, 42% of its customers had adopted at least six of its modules, versus 36% of its customers a year ago. That stickiness indicates it still has plenty of pricing power as it scales up its business.\n\nCrowdStrike's gross margins expanded as economies of scale kicked in, and it turned profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis over the past three quarters as it reined in its stock-based compensation expenses. It expects its adjusted EPS to rise 92% in fiscal 2024, and analysts anticipate 27% growth in fiscal 2025.\n\nThose growth rates are impressive, but its stock looks a bit pricey at 89 times forward earnings. The bulls might argue that its early-mover's advantage in the cloud-native space justifies that premium valuation, but the bears will point out that other formidable competitors -- including Palo Alto Networks and Microsoft -- are still creeping into the cloud-native space.\n\nThe better buy: CrowdStrike\n\nFortinet and CrowdStrike are both good long-term plays on the cybersecurity market, but Fortinet's near-term slowdown and high valuation could limit its gains this year. CrowdStrike's stock looks expensive, but its leading position in the cloud-native niche and rising profits could justify that higher valuation. So for now, I believe CrowdStrike will stay ahead of Fortinet -- but investors should probably wait for it to post its next earnings report on March 5 before initiating a new position.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Fortinet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Fortinet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Fortinet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The cybersecurity industry is filled with high-growth companies. As cyber attacks become more common, corporations and small businesses will have to invest more money into cybersecurity solutions.\n\nWhile hackers are getting smarter, leading cybersecurity firms are keeping up with the trends. Some of them are using artificial intelligence to strengthen their offerings and keep data safe. Many cybersecurity stocks have outperformed the stock market over several years. Here are some of the top cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) impressed many Wall Street investors after delivering a promising earnings report. While financial growth still doesn\u2019t resemble a cybersecurity firm quite yet, the company\u2019s growth indicate it\u2019s moving in the right direction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFortinet reported 10.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023. Product revenue dragged down revenue, but the company\u2019s service revenue grew by 24.8% year-over-year.\n\nThe most exciting development for the company is an 8.5% year-over-year growth in billings, an improvement from last quarter\u2019s 5.7% billings growth rate. A higher growth rate in this area raises the ceiling for next quarter\u2019s revenue growth.\n\nFortinet was regularly able to churn out quarter after quarter of 30%+ year-over-year revenue growth rate when its billings growth rate was at that same level. Fortinet\u2019s revenue growth decelerated when billings dropped. Positive developments in this part of Fortinet\u2019s financials can lead to better growth in the future.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Network (NASDAQ:PANW) is a cybersecurity firm that consistently outpaces the market. The equity has gained 127% over the past year and is up by 400% over the past five years.\n\nAs cyberattacks become more prevalent and lucrative for hackers, more businesses are turning to cybersecurity giants like Palo Alto Networks for protection. In a press release detailing\u00a0Q1 FY23 results, Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora cited an \u201cunprecedented level of attacks\u201d that helped the company expand its market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto Networks reported 20% year-over-year revenue growth to start off fiscal 2024. The company also announced that it expects Q2 FY24 revenue growth to fall in the range of 18% to 20%. Revenue for all of fiscal 2024 is expected to grow by 18% to 19% year-over-year.\n\nRevenue growth seems likely to continue, and profit margins are expanding rapidly. The firm grew its net income by 871% year-over-year in Q1 FY24 and achieved a double-digit net profit margin. Continued earnings growth and market expansion can help PANW reward long-term investors.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

        "title": "11 Stocks That May Be Splitting Soon",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at 11 stocks that might be splitting soon. If you want to skip our overview of what a stock split is and some recent stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Stocks That May Be Splitting Soon.\n\nWhen it comes to keeping investors happy, publicly traded stock managers have several options at their disposal. When it comes to investor expectations, the management strategy depends on the kind of stock. For value stocks, i.e. companies that seek to deliver share price and business stability by targeting well established markets, investors typically hope for dividends and the ability to hedge losses and growth drops during turbulence. Similarly, for growth stocks, the primary driver is, well, growth - both for the earnings per share and the share price.\n\nOne way in which a company can keep its share price stable over the long run and insulate it against sentiment driven volatility is by doing a stock split. A split, if you're unaware, is when a firm divides its shares into more shares. So a one for two split simply means that one share trading for $10 is now worth two shares worth $5 each and so on. The primary motivation for a stock split is management's aim to make the shares more tradeable, particularly for retail investors since a stock split makes the shares more affordable. Additionally, a stock split also increases liquidity, which makes for an overall healthier trading environment.\n\nStock splits are quite common in the stock market and nearly every mega cap stock available for trading today has used them in its history. For instance, one of the most valuable companies in the world, the Cupertino, California consumer technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has gone through five stock splits in its history. The most recent Apple stock split came in 2020 as the world was reeling from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Apple split a single share into four back then, and had the split not occurred and the shares had continued to appreciate by a similar percentage from then until now, then a single Apple share would currently be worth $744 right now. Apple's previous stock split before the 2020 split was a whopping 7 for 1 split in 2014, and cumulatively, as of February 2024, its shares have been divided into 168 components.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuilding on this, 2022 has been a busy year when it comes to mega cap stocks and stock splits. Big ticket names such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have all undergone stock splits which came right when the Federal Reserve was making preparations for lift off when it came to jacking up interest rates. Alphabet and Amazon both announced massive 20 for 1 stock splits in 2022, which was understandable since their shares were trading north of as much as $1,000 by then. When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, market liquidity dries up and investors, both retail and institutional, find it hard to acquire capital to pile into stocks. Therefore, a stock split, which reduces the share price, encourages trading as a unit of a stock is now worth less in absolute dollar terms and can be bought relatively easily. Additionally, record share price gains during the coronavirus pandemic that saw investors flock to technology stocks due to their potential to capitalize from lock downs induced trend also pushed their share prices quite high and management thought it was best to bring it back to comfortable levels by splitting the shares.\n\nFast forwarding to 2024, the year has borne some fruit when it comes to big companies and stock splits. The start of the year has seen the world's largest brick and mortar retailer Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) announce a stock split. Walmart's shares have reclaimed their all time high levels in 2024 after the firm beat analyst Q4 2023 earnings per share estimates and kept the foot on the pedal when it comes to growth by announcing new stores in its biggest market, the U.S. The firm also announced a three for one stock split that is set to go into effect into February 2024. At the heart of the decision is associate well being, argues Walmart, with its official release sharing that the decision is motivated by ensuring an affordable entry level share price for its Associate Stock Purchase Plan.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some stocks that are splitting soon. Some notable names are Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). 11 Stocks That May Be Splitting Soon\n\nImage by moerschy from Pixabay\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that are splitting soon, we first made a list of all stocks that are going to split in February 2024, stocks trading above $1,000 and haven't split in decades, and large cap stocks with more than 100% share price gain over the past year. They were ranked by their market capitalization and the top stocks were chosen.\n\nFor these stocks that may be splitting soon, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n11 Stocks That May Be Splitting Soon\n\n11. The Cooper Companies, Inc.

Its shares have gained more than 120% over the past year, and a multi billion dollar market capitalization makes the firm a great target of a stock split.\n\nDuring last year's third quarter, 53 out of the 910 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey's research had invested in the company. Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLDR)'s largest hedge fund investor is Cliff Asness's AQR Capital Management due to its $195 million investment.\n\n9.

No\n\nThe shares of Deckers Outdoor Corporation (NYSE:DECK) are quite pricey, with a current going tag of $882. This is after a 112% 12 month share price gain that has come alongside a consecutive four quarter earnings EPS beat by the firm.\n\nInsider Monkey's September quarter of 2023 survey covering 910 hedge funds revealed that 42 were the firm's shareholders.

        "title": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this cloud-based security company have returned +13.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which CrowdStrike belongs, has gained 15.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share, indicating a change of +74.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +91.6%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.65 indicates a change of +23.8% from what CrowdStrike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, CrowdStrike is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor CrowdStrike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $839.08 million indicates a year-over-year change of +31.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.05 billion and $3.91 billion estimates indicate +36.1% and +28.3% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $786.01 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +35.3%. EPS of $0.82 for the same period compares with $0.40 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $777.2 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.13%. The EPS surprise was +10.81%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCrowdStrike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CrowdStrike. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Bull of the Day: CyberArk Software (CYBR)",
        "content": "CyberArk Software (CYBR) is back in the upper deck of the Zacks Rank after reporting another stunning beat and raise quarter last week.\r\n\r\nWith its 72% EPS beat for Q4, the mid-cap leader in end-to-end identity security and continuous cyber threat detection has now posted four consecutive quarters averaging a positive surprise of 76%.\r\n\r\nFollowing last week's 18.5% surge in CYBR shares, the company has now entered the big-cap arena with a market capitalization of $11.5 billion.\r\n\r\nAnd it will likely remain there as the company's outlook keeps pushing higher for both sales and profits, forcing Wall Street analysts to keep raising their estimates. You can get all the details on their growth and guidance in this article...\r\n\r\nCyberArk (CYBR) Soars 8% as Q4 Earnings & Sales Crush Estimates\r\n\r\nWhile it's likely that not all of the analyst upward revisions have yet to be submitted to the Zacks Rank quantitative weighting algorithm since last Thursday's report (as I write on Monday morning), the current consensus projections are making growth investors salivate as CyberArk is able to leverage its recurring revenues, subscriptions, and margins into higher realms of profitability...\n\nEstimates as of 2/10/24\r\n\r\n2024 Revenue: +23% to $926M\r\n2025 Revenue: +21.5% to $1.13B\r\n\r\n2024 EPS: +55% to $1.74\r\n2025 EPS: +92.5% to $3.35\r\n\r\nState of Threat: Cyber Crime 3.0\r\n\r\nThe link above is to my Zacks Confidential special report in October where I recommended buying shares of CYBR under $170. I also suggested buying CrowdStrike (CRWD), Okta (OKTA), and Datadog (DDOG).\r\n\r\nMore on the rationale for loading up with these cyber-security winners in a moment. First, let's review part of the CYBR growth story...\r\n\r\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, the Identity Security solution provider\u2019s reported revenues increased 32% year over year to $223.1 million and surpassed the consensus mark of $209.7 million. Markedly, more than 90% of quarterly revenues were recurring in nature, which surged 41% year over year to $201.5 million.\r\n\r\nAnnual Recurring Revenues (\u201cARR\u201d) increased 36% to $774 million. The subscription portion, which accounted for 75% of the total ARR, soared 60% year over year to $582 million. This upside was primarily driven by a record number of software-as-a-service solution bookings and the strong demand for on-premise subscription offerings.\r\n\r\nIn my State of Threat: Cyber Crime 3.0 report, I wrote this...\r\n\r\nWith more big hacks and data breaches in the past few months, including MGM, 23andMe, and Flagstar Bank of Michigan -- their third since 2021 -- it\u2019s becoming clear that a permanent state of ever-sophisticated threats exist for companies of all sizes.\r\n\r\nWe may have naively thought at some point in the past few years that cybersecurity companies, armed with big technology, bigger enterprise customer budgets, and highly-skilled people, would eventually close the gaps in corporate defenses.\r\n\r\nBut that dream has faded into a much more sober realization. Cyber crime is now one of the most advanced organized criminal ventures on the planet.\r\n\r\nFrom state-sanctioned hacking, theft, and espionage to the incredible digital reach of skilled, armed bad actors across the globe, the lure of endless power and riches compares to any revolution in human history -- including the great Age of Exploration in the 16th to 18th centuries.\r\n\r\nNote: I just read SpaceX engineer Andrew Rader\u2019s book Beyond the Known for the second time and he knows his seafaring history as well as anyone. Highly recommend it.\r\n\r\nBut it gets worse. Just as we come to grips with the bad guys always being one step ahead of our latest data defenses, a new weapon has been presented to them that will intensify the war exponentially.\r\n\r\nThat weapon, of course, is Artificial Intelligence (AI). As much as I praise the growth and advancement that AI is bringing to industry, science, and society, we can easily see it is a double-edged sword when hidden forces can manipulate and destroy from a safe distance in their cyber bunkers.\r\n\r\n(end of my Zacks Confidential special report excerpt from October)\r\n\r\nTo see the full detailed report with expert analysis on cybercrime scope, projections, and costs, just go to State of Threat.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a subscription to Zacks Confidential -- where one of a dozen analysts writes a unique research report on a particular industry, sector, or economy-wide growth trend every Monday -- it is by far one of the best deals in investment analysis anywhere at under $100 per year.\r\n\r\nLast time I checked it was still only $59 a year for 52 fresh, proprietary reports. And you get access to all the archives going back several years. Whatever the current price, you can get a 30-day trial for a buck and see for yourself if you find value in our research and stock picks.\r\n\r\nWhy Did I Recommend 4 Cyber Stocks in October?\r\n\r\nI think you get a rough idea from my Zacks Confidential excerpt above that I slowly become aware last summer that the threat landscape had become obscenely sophisticated and sinister, like trying to fight Skynet without help from the Terminator.\r\n\r\nSo I wanted to go all-in on the best defenders I could find -- since none of them can do the job alone and most enterprises use several of them, just like any SaaS subscription.\r\n\r\nRedundancy is essential for security, as any military or IT leader will tell you.\r\n\r\nHere were my October rationales for picking CyberArk, CrowdStrike, Okta, and Datadog...\r\n\r\nCyberArk Software (CYBR): This $6.7 billion veteran provider of enterprise security is growing sales this year and next at 24% to $900 million. I think this Zacks #2 Rank is undervalued and so does the team at Piper Sandler who has a $200 PT on shares.\r\n\r\nHeadquartered in Israel, CyberArk was founded in 1999. The company is a vital security partner to more than 5,400 global businesses, which include over 50% of the Fortune 500 and more than 35% of the Global 2000 companies.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike (CRWD): This $44 billion leader in \u201cedge\u201d security for mobile, IoT, and government / military applications has been surging to new highs since their August 31 earnings report. As many employees and senior management continue to work from home and remotely, the threat vulnerabilities are multiplied outside of enterprise firewalls. CrowdStrike's Zero Trust solution is intended to prevent breaches in real time on any identity, endpoint, or remote workload.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks #2 Rank is more expensive given the recent stock move, but with 35% topline growth this year -- and next year projected to tag $4 billion with another 28% advance -- it's going to remain on the top list for growth investors. It doesn\u2019t hurt that profits are following with an 83% jump to EPS of $2.82. And these are the guys, led by founder George Kurtz, who have deep experience in Europe and Asia and are watching every move that Russia and China make.\r\n\r\nOkta (OKTA): A $14 billion leader in identity security, trying to prevent human credential breaches as happened with MGM. Okta was not to blame for that breach, and now they have more intel about where to target defenses to prevent further identity breaches. With 19% sales growth this year and 14% projected next year to cross $2.5 billion, the stock is a relative bargain trading under 6 times sales.\r\n\r\nThey have also become quickly profitable with profits surging 3,000% this year and still looking at potential 28% growth next year to $1.50 EPS. I have to explore the extent of their R&D with biometrics, but I have some sources telling me to be optimistic this is a field they will also lead in.\r\n\r\nDatadog (DDOG): Here\u2019s what I wrote when I bought this stock for my TAZR Trader group last week (early October)...\r\n\r\nTAZR Portfolio is buying a starter position in Datadog (DDOG) between $85 and $90. We would add to this Zacks #1 Rank on any drop after earnings 11/2.\r\n\r\nWhile DDOG is largely a data monitoring and analytics platform, Piper Sandler recently made it one of their top 5 cybersecurity picks as an end-to-end observability and cloud security platform. The Piper team has a price target for DDOG shares at $115, implying over 25% potential upside.\r\n\r\nData is the gold of this new digital age and we need look no further than the recent acquisition of Splunk by Cisco to see what enterprises are willing to invest to stay ahead.\r\n\r\nThere's more intel on both DDOG and CYBR in the full Zacks Confidential report State of Threat.\r\n\r\nAnd here's how the 4 picks have done since October 17 through last Friday...\r\n\r\nCRWD: +76.62%\r\nCYBR: +65.57%\r\nDDOG: +50.82%\r\nOKTA: +2.51%\r\n\r\nFinally, if you don't own any cybersecurity stocks, I recommend buying CYBR and OKTA soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The stock market gives investors many choices. There are thousands of corporations offering their shares in the public markets. Holding onto the right equities can lead to meaningful long-term returns.\n\nSome stocks are better than others and have the potential to become rising stars. This class of equities can outperform the market and reward long-term investors. If you are looking for some growth stock ideas, you may want to consider these companies.\n\nSupermicro (SMCI) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks. S&P 600 Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nSupermicro (NASDAQ:SMCI) has enjoyed a bull run of the ages with a 132% year-to-date gain that has comfortably outperformed the major indices. The company\u2019s servers are built to handle the intense workload of artificial intelligence chips and are gaining momentum.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSupermicro\u2019s rapid growth at the start of the year emerged due to the company\u2019s exceptional earnings and guidance. Net sales more than doubled year-over-year in the\u00a0second quarter of fiscal 2024. The midpoint of Supermicro\u2019s third-quarter guidance ($3.9 billion) suggests revenue will grow by over 200% year-over-year. Supermicro closed out Q3 FY23 with $1.3 billion in revenue.\n\nInclusion into the\u00a0S&P 500 seems inevitable at this point and will help the stock rally higher. Since the S&P 500 is a weighted index, Supermicro will become a larger percentage of the index as its market cap expands. Supermicro is generating all of this momentum without being in the index.\n\nInvestors may also want to note that a board member recently bought\u00a0$1 million worth of shares in the company. This purchase took place after the equity took off in 2024. Insiders are bullish, and it\u2019s easy to see why.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Q4 2023 results demonstrated that the advertising market is accelerating. Revenue increased by 13% year-over-year while net income surged by 41% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence played a role in search engine and cloud revenue. Alphabet has been using AI to improve its products so businesses have more reasons to stick around. Cloud revenue was a standout with its 25.7% year-over-year growth rate.\n\nThe company\u2019s Other Bets segment also performed well but represents a minuscule segment of total revenue. While Other Bets is an unprofitable segment, Google Cloud recently became profitable and can expand margins in the future.\n\nAlphabet has two massive cash flow-producing segments that can fund other growth opportunities. The firm changed its name from Google to Alphabet to indicate the company wants to be more than just a search engine and a video platform. The corporation is strong already and looks poised to gain market share in multiple verticals.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is a cosmetics brand that only uses ethical ingredients in its beauty products. The company has been a big hit among Gen Z and other age groups.\n\nShares have surged by over 1,750% over the past five years, and it looks like they can generate more gains for investors. The company\u2019s recent earnings report offered more reasons for optimism.\n\nElf Beauty reported an impressive 85% sales growth rate in the\u00a0third quarter of fiscal 2024. That\u2019s a higher growth rate than the 78% year-over-year revenue growth posted in the previous quarter. The company gained an additional 305 basis points of market share.\n\nThis marks the company\u2019s 20th consecutive quarter of sales growth. Net income jumped from $19.1 million to $26.9 million which is a 40.8% year-over-year increase.\n\nElf Beauty raised guidance considerably for fiscal 2024. The midpoint in fiscal 2024 revenue guidance was previously $901 million. The midpoint has been moved to $985 million which indicates strong growth in the upcoming quarter.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the largest publicly traded company by market cap. If you invest in a fund that mirrors the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100, you already have exposure to this equity.\n\nMicrosoft has gained 55% over the past year and is up by 292% over the past five years. Double-digit growth rates in enticing verticals helped the tech conglomerate reach a $3 trillion market cap.\n\nThe company\u2019s earnings results for\u00a0Q2 FY24 highlight why it\u2019s been a top stock. Revenue increased by 18% year-over-year while net income jumped by 33% year-over-year. Microsoft\u2019s completed Activision Blizzard acquisition and further successes with artificial intelligence contributed to the financial results.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was a standout and was up by 24% year-over-year. Cloud is a meaningful revenue driver for the company that can remain high for many years to come. The firm hasn\u2019t shied away from making big investments and can use its capital to acquire additional companies.\n\nCloudflare (NET) In this photo illustration a Cloudflare Inc (NET) logo is seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) keeps many websites up and running. The content delivery network firm also has several cybersecurity features designed to keep its clients safe from attacks.\n\nCloudflare has a good reputation for outperforming the market. Shares are up by 87% over the past year and have gained 506% over the past five years.\n\nThe company\u2019s\u00a0fourth-quarter results drew plenty of excitement and resulted in a 20% gain in the stock price. During that quarter, Cloudflare grew revenue by 32% year-over-year. The firm also achieved record operating cash flow and record free cash flow.\n\nCloudflare is experiencing more demand for its services and broke a new record for the annual contract value for one of its customers. The company didn\u2019t stop at signing its largest new customer. Cloudflare also sealed the deal on its largest customer renewal ever. Customers are turning to Cloudflare in an uncertain economy to stay safe from hackers and keep their systems up and running.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) delivered a record-breaking third quarter that exceeded expectations. Annual recurring revenue now exceeds $3 billion and the firm grew its revenue by 35% year-over-year.\n\nThe company\u2019s artificial intelligence initiatives have given customers more choices and better results. George Kurtz, Crowdstrike\u2019s president, co-founder, and CEO, shared promising news about those efforts in the press release.\n\n\u201cCustomers increasingly trust the AI-native Falcon XDR platform as their cybersecurity consolidator of choice,\u201d Kurtz stated.\n\nThe company is also sitting on $3.17 billion in cash which it can use to make acquisitions. While stock buybacks should be ruled out for now since the company is still expanding, investors can feel more confident knowing Crowdstrike has a large cash position and is generating profits.\n\nThe equity has rewarded long-term investors so far. CRWD stock is up by 202% over the past year and has a 5-year gain of 413%. Crowdstrike is one of the top cybersecurity firms and offers exposure to a rapidly growing industry.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a top-performing semiconductor stock that recently surpassed a $600 billion market cap. The equity\u2019s 1-year and 5-year gains stand at 116% and 355% respectively.\n\nThe company has benefitted from semiconductor tailwinds for many years, but artificial intelligence has propped the stock higher in recent months. Broadcom\u2019s Trident 5-X12 is the answer for companies that want effective AI chips.\n\nThe cutting-edge chip contributed to Broadcom\u2019s 5% year-over-year revenue growth in the\u00a0third quarter of fiscal 2023. Broadcom initiated $2.17 billion in stock buybacks and accumulated 2.9 million shares.\n\nBroadcom continues to give out dividends to investors and recently\u00a0hiked its quarterly dividend from $4.60 per share to $5.25 per share. That\u2019s a 14.1% growth rate.\n\nBroadcom also has a vast software business segment that became stronger from its VMware acquisition.

        "title": "Is CrowdStrike (CRWD) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nCrowdStrike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.17, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 42 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.17 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 42 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 37 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 88.1% and 7.1% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CRWD Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRWD\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for CrowdStrike here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying CrowdStrike, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs CRWD Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for CrowdStrike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.4% over the past month to $2.95.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for CrowdStrike.

        "title": "Want $1 Million in Retirement? Invest $50,000 in These 3 Stocks and Wait a Decade",
        "content": "\"A few good ideas is all you need. And when you find the few, you have to act aggressively. That's the Munger system.\"-Charlie Munger\n\nBoom! $150,000 lands in your pocket out of nowhere.\n\nWhat would you do? Buy a new car? Embark on the vacation of a lifetime? Renovate your home?\n\nIf I were to find myself in such a hypothetical scenario, I know what I would do: I'd follow Charlie Munger's advice and invest it -- perhaps $50,000 each into three stocks. Maybe it would go something like this: Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Visa\n\nFirst up is Visa (NYSE: V), the world's largest payment-processing company.\n\nNotice that I called Visa a payment-processing company rather than a credit card company. That's because Visa doesn't issue credit or debit cards. Indeed, contrary to popular belief, Visa doesn't offer customers credit, set rates, or charge fees. Instead, Visa partners with financial institutions like banks and credit unions by offering access to the Visa-branded payment network (for a fee).\n\nThat's a key distinction, as Visa has no credit risk. It also means the company's revenue is largely tied to the volume of payments and transactions on its network.\n\nAt any rate, Visa's no-nonsense business model has delivered exceptional shareholder gains. Over the last decade, Visa's stock has generated an annualized total return (price appreciation plus dividend payments) of 18.4%. V Total Return Level Chart\n\nThat means $50,000 invested in Visa 10 years ago would be worth $271,000 today -- not too shabby. However, I also have my eye on some spicier picks.\n\n2. CrowdStrike\n\nNext up is a younger, faster-growing company. It's CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), a leader in AI-driven cybersecurity solutions. While I value Visa for its steady growth, CrowdStrike is all about potential.\n\nThe company is growing revenue at a 35% year-over-year rate as of its most recent quarter (the three months ending on Oct. 31, 2023). Moreover, the overall cybersecurity market that CrowdStrike aims to satisfy is growing by leaps and bounds.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn short, that's because cybercrime is booming. Hackers -- seeking money, political retribution, or chaos -- are running amok right now. Large organizations, ranging from large-cap corporations to governments and non-profits, are all scrambling to protect their networks, harden their defenses, and safeguard their data.\n\nMore to the point, some analysts expect the cybersecurity market to grow by 50% to $274 billion by 2028 -- presenting a significant opportunity for cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike.\n\nAt any rate, CrowdStrike's stock has rewarded investors since its debut in 2019. Its total return since then is more than 423% or almost 43% annually.\n\nIn other words, $50,000 invested in CrowdStrike's Initial Public Offering (IPO) on June 12, 2019, would be worth $260,000 as of the time of this writing.  CRWD Total Return Level Chart\n\nThat's an impressive return, and if CrowdStrike shares grow at that rate over the next decade, my hypothetical portfolio would be well on its way to $1 million.\n\nHowever, I still have one final pick to make.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nLast, we arrive at Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). In my opinion, no other stock can match Nvidia's combination of actual results and potential.\n\nAs for the results, they're plain to see. MetaPlatforms, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and many others are buying all the Nvidia AI chips they can get their hands on. And yet, the demand seems insatiable because the world can't get enough of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nFor his part, Nvidia Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang put it this way: \"For the very first time, because of generative AI, computer technology is going to impact literally every single industry and every single country.\"\n\nSo, given the massive demand for AI chips, it should come as no surprise that Nvidia has been one of the best stocks to own over the last 10 years.\n\nIndeed, a $50,000 investment made in Nvidia shares 10 years ago would now be worth an astronomical $9.2 million as of this writing. NVDA Total Return Level Chart\n\nIt's hard to believe that a similar return is possible for Nvidia shares over the next 10 years, but no one really knows.\n\nOne thing is certain: The world is desperate for more AI products, which means more AI chips. Nvidia is currently the market leader, but others, like AMD and Intel, want to catch up. Moreover, some big tech names like Alphabet and Apple are developing their own AI chips, given the lucrative nature of the market.\n\nStill, Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from the surge in AI demand for many years.

        "title": "3 Top Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy in February",
        "content": "The world is progressively becoming more digital. There are billions of smartphones and connected devices, and companies increasingly work remotely and rely on cloud services. With this rise in technology has also come an increase in cyberattacks.\n\nAccording to IBM's 2023 Cost of a Data Breach report, 51% of organizations were planning to increase investments in security as a result of a breach. The average cost of a data breach globally was over $4.45 million, up 15% from three years ago. And that's just one type of cyberattack.\n\nAs attacks become more frequent (and expensive), the need for cybersecurity solutions has amplified, putting the industry in indispensable territory. For investors wanting to go along for the ride, here are three top cybersecurity stocks to buy in February.\n\n1. CrowdStrike\n\nIf you were anywhere near the tech world in the past year, you know how unavoidable artificial intelligence (AI) has been. It has gone mainstream recently, but AI has been around for a while. One of the companies that helped usher in AI in its industry is CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD). Since 2011, it has been using AI to power its cybersecurity solutions.\n\nCrowdStrike isn't just a recipient of AI hype; its business results show the company is one of the premier cybersecurity stocks in the industry. It offers different modules that address a broad range of cybersecurity needs, and 63% of its subscription customers use at least five modules. Around 26% use seven or more.\n\nGrowing subscriptions and a comprehensive ecosystem helped CrowdStrike achieve $3.2 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in its 2023 third quarter (ended Oct. 31), up 35% year over year (YOY). Its operating income surged 81% YOY to $356 million, showing increased profitability, and the margins on that income were also up 9% from two years prior.\n\nCrowdStrike stock isn't necessarily cheap, but it should be an excellent long-term investment for those who can stomach the volatility likely to come with it.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Palo Alto Networks\n\nFounded in 2005, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) is one of the older pure cybersecurity companies. It's also one of the largest, with a market cap of over $100 billion (as of Feb. 5), thanks to a 120% stock price jump over the past 12 months.\n\nMany cybersecurity companies offer various products, but Palo Alto Networks prides itself on essentially being a one-stop shop. Whether it's firewalls, advanced threat protection, or cloud security, the company offers a comprehensive suite of tools.\n\nIn the first quarter of its 2024 fiscal year, it made $1.88 billion in revenue, up 20% year over year. Investors shouldn't expect the same growth as you would from younger cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike, but there's something to be said about Palo Alto's improving profitability.\n\nIn its latest quarter, it had operating income of $529 million with 28% margins. In the same period last year, those numbers were $322 million and 21%, respectively.\n\nPalo Alto Networks has a customer base of large clients that need thorough solutions, and the company has been effective at providing them. If you want a company that operates on the full spectrum of cybersecurity, this is your go-to.\n\n3. Cisco Systems\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) is a cybersecurity company with a slightly different approach than the other two on this list. While CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks are focused on cybersecurity software, Cisco's bread and butter has long been its hardware.\n\nAlthough hardware is what largely made Cisco the $200 billion company it is today, it has been taking steps to compete more directly with cybersecurity software. Its $28 billion acquisition of Splunk (expected to close later this year) is one of the clearest signs of the company's strategic shift toward enhancing its software choices. The deal should boost its security portfolio.\n\nBecoming more service-focused should benefit Cisco because it provides more recurring revenue than hardware sales. It won't be (and hasn't been) the quickest transition, but there are signs of progress despite some economic headwinds in the past couple of years.\n\nIn the meantime, Cisco's dividend should help buy it some patience from investors. The quarterly dividend is $0.39, with a yield of around 3.1%. That's well over double the S&P 500's recent average.\n\nMore importantly, investors don't have to question the dividend's stability. It has increased every year since Cisco began paying one in 2011.\n\nCisco can be a chance for investors to get exposure to the cybersecurity industry and simultaneously receive consistent income.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In an era of rapid tech advancement, the stock market is constantly explored for next-generation tech companies poised for exponential growth. Three standout players have captured attention with their phenomenal 10-year growth prospects. From cybersecurity solutions to AI-powered automation platforms and marketing software, these companies are framing the edge of industries and the future of tech itself.\n\nThe article delves into these companies\u2019 strategic direction and performance metrics. They are focused on innovation, resilience and market dominance. The first one has unparalleled success in addressing cybersecurity challenges. Meanwhile, the second one has transformative automation solutions. The third one has disruptive marketing technology. These factors suggest the immense potential of these next-gen tech stocks.\n\nRead more to unravel the secrets behind their meteoric rise. Explore why these companies have been positioned to redefine the tech space for years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s (NASDAQ:CRWD) ability to accelerate net new average recurring revenue (ARR) at scale is a fundamental strength that supports its rapid growth potential. Despite a challenging macro environment, the company achieved double-digit net new ARR acceleration, indicating robust customer demand. That acceleration signifies CrowdStrike\u2019s strong market position and the effectiveness of its AI-native XDR platform in addressing cybersecurity challenges. Thus, the scalability of CrowdStrike\u2019s business model can be observed in its expanding customer base.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s P&L discipline and record profitability suggest solid financial management and operational efficiency. For instance, achieving record levels of profitability, including record GAAP and non-GAAP operating profitability, reflects the company\u2019s capability to balance growth. That strength enhances CrowdStrike\u2019s resilience and ability to sustain rapid growth over the long term. Moreover, the record free cash flow of\u00a0$239 million (Q3 2024) represents a 30% free cash flow margin. That demonstrates the company\u2019s strong cash generation (Rule of 66) capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s massive goal of reaching\u00a0$10 billion in ARR reflects its confidence in sustained growth and market-wide lead. The company had edgy performance (35% year-over-year topline growth) in Q3, coupled with its strategic investments in go-to-market strategies. That positions CrowdStrike well to surpass market expectations and set new records consistently. Also, it can capture a larger share of the cybersecurity market and drive continued growth in ARR.\n\nFinally, CrowdStrike\u2019s market validation comes through industry recognition, reinforcing its high valuations in the cybersecurity space.\u00a0Recognition from industry analyst firms, such as MITRE, Gartner (NYSE:IT), Forrester (NASDAQ:FORR) and IDC, suggests the company\u2019s credibility. Hence, the performance and accolades validate CrowdStrike\u2019s brand visibility and market trust, further supporting its value growth momentum.\n\nUiPath (PATH) An image of UiPath's logo; white text over an orange background\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) has strong ARR growth and topline performance. For instance, in Q3, UiPath demonstrated growth in ARR, which increased by 24%. That rapid increase reflects the company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its end-to-end automation platform. Similarly, UiPath had a 24% increase in revenue, aligning with the growth in ARR. That suggests the company\u2019s effectiveness in converting ARR into realized revenue, indicating a healthy business model.\n\nStrategically, UiPath shifted its go-to-market resources towards organizations with long-term investment potential in enterprise automation. Focusing on specific market segments helps UiPath allocate resources effectively and capitalize on growth opportunities. UiPath witnessed a significant increase in customers with $1 million or more in ARR, growing by 31% to 264. Additionally, the number of customers with $100K or more in ARR increased, indicating strong customer retention with rapid expansion.\n\nFurthermore, collaborations with vital partners like SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Deloitte also boost customer acquisition and expansion. These partnerships support UiPath in accessing new markets, enhancing its product offerings and driving customer engagement. Also, UiPath\u2019s focus on industry-specific solutions and playbooks improves its capability to address unique customer requirements. By offering tailored solutions and support, UiPath strengthens itself as a preferred automation partner in the industry.\n\nMoreover, UiPath introduced innovative\u00a0features\u00a0such as Autopilot and intelligent document processing powered by generative AI. These enhancements enhance the user experience with accelerated automation development to drive tangible business outcomes. Also, UiPath\u2019s efforts are recognized by third-party assessments, such as being named a leader in intelligent document processing by IDC MarketScape. Hence, this recognition validates UiPath\u2019s solid product capabilities.\n\nFinally, UiPath\u2019s focus on AI-powered automation differentiates its platform from competitors, supporting a continuous ascension in performance and valuations.\n\nHubSpot (HUBS) Hubspot (HUBS) logo displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo begin with, HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) has constant topline growth and bottom-line expansion. HubSpot\u2019s topline, with a 25% year-over-year increase in Q3 2023, suggests its fundamental strength. That growth led to a solid operating margin expansion of 7% points year-over-year, reaching 16%. Such robust performance indicates the company\u2019s capability to monetize its offerings while maintaining profitability effectively.\n\nAdditionally, HubSpot\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers is another driver of its growth potential. Total customers grew by 22% year-over-year to over 194K globally. There were over 9.1K net customer additions in the quarter alone. Moreover, the company\u2019s focus on multi-hub adoption and customer consolidation on fewer platforms further strengthens its customer base.\n\nRegarding AI integration, HubSpot\u2019s focus on continuous product innovation and the integration of AI-powered features distinguishes it in the market. The company capitalizes on its agility and responsiveness to demand trends with significant releases such as the Sales Hub relaunch and HubSpot AI. The strategic focus on AI adoption can also be observed, with 40% of enterprise customers and\u00a020%\u00a0of pro customers already leveraging HubSpot AI features. Also, integrating AI across all hubs and introducing ChatSpot exemplify HubSpot\u2019s inclination toward driving customer value through edgy tech.\n\nFinally, HubSpot\u2019s bimodal go-to-market strategy is vital to driving rapid growth. By capturing both the lower and upper ends of the market spectrum, HubSpot maximizes its customer reach and volume. There are leads in the Starter tier, particularly in attracting new customers through free sign-ups and growth optimization, highlighting the effectiveness of this strategy.\n\nOverall, the customer base has upward mobility potential as businesses within the starter tier evolve into higher tiers. Hence, this presents a strategic opportunity for sustained value growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Collective group will advocate for responsible and trustworthy AI to empower the Federal Government and private sector\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, February 08, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD) today announced it is a founding member of the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s (NIST) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Safety Institute Consortium (AISIC), demonstrating its commitment to the advancement and promotion of responsible AI. The AISIC will act as a collaborative platform where both public sector and private stakeholders will help shepherd standards and techniques around the broader implementation and development of trustworthy AI.\n\nThe initiative is part of NIST\u2019s response to President Biden\u2019s landmark Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence, which tasks NIST with a number of responsibilities to advance the safe, secure and trustworthy development and use of AI. CrowdStrike remains at the forefront of AI-native cybersecurity, pioneering breakthrough applications of AI to elevate and accelerate critical security workflows to more effectively stop breaches, save time and minimize costs. CrowdStrike\u2019s portfolio of innovations are delivered through the AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae XDR Platform, and include Charlotte AI, the purpose-built engine powering the company\u2019s portfolio of generative AI capabilities across the platform. CrowdStrike\u2019s comprehensive knowledge in the AI space will assist the AISIC to develop proven, scalable and interoperable methodologies to develop the responsible use of AI systems and the promotion of responsible AI.\n\nResponsible Use of AI & Privacy by Design\n\nAs highlighted in CrowdStrike\u2019s recent testimony to the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, although threat actors will continue to leverage AI with malicious intent, it\u2019s important to recognize the significant benefits AI is driving in cybersecurity. Time and time again, these tools overperform by a wide margin over legacy technology that does not incorporate AI. However, AI that lacks privacy-by-design can introduce enterprise risk. An overarching goal of the AISIC \u2013 in conjunction with Executive Order 14110 \u2013 is to promote the development and responsible use of trustworthy AI applications to ensure that data stays private and protected.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"As a leading U.S. cybersecurity technology partner for the Federal Government, CrowdStrike has redefined modern security.

        "content": "Why Are CrowdStrike (CRWD) Shares Soaring Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) jumped 6% in the afternoon session after major indices rose on strong momentum, with the S&P 500 set to hit 5,000 points for the first time. The Nasdaq also gained 1%, while the Dow Jones index rose 0.55% as stocks continued to report earnings. The earnings season has been good thus far, with positive reports from tech giants including Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta. These encouraging prints should likely help sustain growing optimism stemming from the expectations for positive gains in 2024, especially for AI-related stocks. Also, there are hopes that the Fed will begin to cut rates in the first half of 2024, a move that should help ease business conditions.\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nIs now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nCrowdStrike's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 13 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 29 days ago, when the company gained 5.4% on the news that Morgan Stanley analyst Hamza Fodderwala upgraded the stock's rating from Equal-Weight to Overweight and raised the price target from $203 to $304. The price target implied a potential 10% upside from where shares traded when the upgrade was announced. Fodderwala noted, \"We see an improving demand outlook for CRWD as accelerating cyberattacks, multiple new products and [generative AI] tailwinds drive estimates upside.\" This upgrade aligns with a period marked by an uptick in geopolitical conflicts, which often result in attacks aimed at cyber assets. As a result, these trends could generate more demand for cybersecurity vendors as businesses must keep their networks and devices safe from threat actors.\n\nCrowdStrike is up 29.3% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike's shares at the IPO in June 2019 would now be looking at an investment worth $5,504.\n\nDo you want to know what moves the stocks you care about?

        "title": "Why Fortinet, CrowdStrike, and Palo Alto Networks Stocks Zoomed Higher Today",
        "content": "Wednesday is shaping up to be a good day to own cybersecurity stocks: Powerful fourth-quarter earnings from network security company Fortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT) sent its stock up by 3%, and provided a tailwind to shares of peers CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), and Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW). Through 11:45 a.m. ET, those two stocks were up 5.8% and 7%, respectively.\n\nReporting its fourth-quarter results Tuesday after the close, Fortinet beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Instead of the $0.43 per share (adjusted) profit on $1.41 billion in sales it was expected to report, the company earned $0.51 per share on sales of $1.42 billion.\n\nFortinet Q4 sales and earnings\n\nTheFly.com has counted no fewer than 16 analysts raising their price targets on Fortinet in response to its report. And yet, how good was Fortinet's news, actually?\n\nYou might be surprised to learn that it actually wasn't all that great. True, sales for the quarter grew by a respectable 10% year over year. But billings -- which foreshadow future revenue growth -- grew by only 8.5%, implying a slowdown may lurk just around the corner.\n\nNon-GAAP profits exceeded expectations, and were up a strong 16%. But earnings as calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles were only $0.40 per share for the quarter -- flat year over year. Worst of all, free cash flow plummeted by 67% to just $165 million.\n\nMost of these numbers, by the way, reflected a significant slowdown in growth compared to Fortinet's performance earlier in the year. Over the course of 2023, Fortinet scored sales growth of 20%, billings growth of 14%, non-GAAP profits growth of 37% -- and GAAP earnings growth of 38%. (To give credit where credit is due, however, its free cash flow for the year did grow 19%.)\n\nWhat does Fortinet's earnings beat mean for CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks?\n\nSo yes, Fortinet \"beat earnings.\" And yes, investors in peer cybersecurity companies CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks have reason to breathe a sigh of relief ... for now. All that being said, as an investor in one of these three stocks (Palo Alto), Fortinet's performance in Q4 actually has me feeling just a tiny bit nervous. Consider this:\n\nStory continues\n\nOn top of the slowdown seen in Q4, Fortinet's guidance for the first quarter -- and for 2024 as a whole -- holds reasons for worry. Management is predicting that sales in Q1 will land in the $1.3 billion to $1.36 billion range. The entirety of this range falls short of Wall Street's consensus expectation of $1.37 billion. Similarly, for the year, Fortinet predicts revenues between $5.72 billion and $5.82 billion -- but Wall Street wants to see $5.93 billion.\n\nGranted, on earnings, the near term looks a bit better. Fortinet's Q1 guidance for non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.37 to $0.39 implies the company thinks it could beat Wall Street's forecast for $0.37 per share. But the midpoint of the company's earnings guidance for the year implies the company might struggle to earn the $1.67 per share that analysts are expecting it to earn -- and Fortinet gave no guidance at all for GAAP profits, nor for free cash flow.\n\nNow, look ahead to the upcoming earnings reports from Palo Alto Networks (due Feb. 20) and CrowdStrike (due March 5). In each case, Wall Street has its expectations set high, predicting that Palo Alto will report 24% quarterly earnings growth in Q4 ... and that CrowdStrike will grow its profits by 75%. Those are aggressive targets. Even more worrisome is the fact that analysts will want to see both companies express similarly high hopes for 2024. To avoid disappointing investors, Palo Alto must promise to keep on growing its earnings at 24% for another year. CrowdStrike, meanwhile, must promise an accelerating growth rate: 92% growth.\n\nWith both of these stocks already trading at extremely high multiples to forward earnings -- 64.5 for Palo Alto and 81.3 for CrowdStrike -- they look priced for perfection. Any stumble on earnings day -- be it in the actual results they report or the future earnings they predict -- could send either or both stocks plummeting.\n\nCaveat investor.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Fortinet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Fortinet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Fortinet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In the ever-changing world of finance, investors seek various avenues for long-term profitability. A mix of growth and dividend stocks can offer the desired mix for many investors. Top growth stocks provide the sort of viable long-term cash flow potential investors want, while dividend-paying companies offer relative stability within a portfolio.\n\nNow, with the S&P 500 officially in a bull market, all eyes are on growth stocks. Investors seeking exposure to high-growth names may be doing so when valuations are near all-time highs in certain sectors.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t good reason for this valuation level. Some companies, like a few of the stocks I\u2019ve listed here, are expensive for a reason. However, investors should take a measured approach to these stocks and consider their fundamentals before diving in.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that said, here are three of the top growth stocks I think investors should consider precisely for their fundamentals.\n\nASML Holdings (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML), a lithography systems market champ, had a sluggish 2023 but came back in Q4, achieving nearly 13% year-over-year net sales growth. The company holds impressive metrics and a significant backlog of 39 billion euros.\n\nASML\u2019s top position in EUV technology is critical for semiconductor advancement, especially in advanced memory solutions. CEO Peter Wennink maintained a humble outlook despite positive signs of a 2024 revenue similar to the previous year. The company sets eyes for significant growth in 2025.\n\nAMSL Holdings shares skyrocketed nearly 10%, reaching a peak driven by substantial Q4 earnings and a robust order backlog, indicating a recovery in the computer chip market. The Dutch company\u2019s market capitalization outdid \u20ac300 billion. Q4 net profits increased by 9% to \u20ac2 billion on sales of \u20ac7.2 billion, surpassing analyst forecasts.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has seen some rather incredible results of late. The company\u2019s third-quarter earnings report showed a 96% increase in operating profitability, and an all-time best in terms of margins at 22% delivered. This significant improvement in fundamentals underscores CrowdStrike\u2019s ability to grow at scale while maintaining its profitability.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s balanced long-term approach towards growth and profitability positions it for long-term success. This philosophy is further highlighted in the company\u2019s new target models, driving year-over-year improvement in subscription gross margins from 82% to 85%, operating margins from 28% to 32%, and free cash flow margins from 34% to the new 38%. Investors gain confidence from these targets that the company will maintain growth.\n\nIn the the long-term, investors seeking exposure to the cybersecurity space will continue to favor fundamentally-strong companies capable of gaining market share profitably. Currently, CRWD appears to be a premier way to play this space, and has captured my attention as a top growth stock.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) The Snowflake logo on a company office in Silicon Valley, California. (SNOW IPO)\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmid market cyclicality, Snowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) has been a relatively strong performer. Similar to many top growth stocks, SNOW stock has yet to reach its all-time highs from the previous bull market rally. However, on a one-year basis, Snowflake is among the top-performing cloud stocks in the market, and has captured my attention.\n\nMuch of this recent improvement is closely tied with Snowflake\u2019s AI integrations. The narrative around artificial intelligence is expected to persist, providing benefits to companies that can leverage this technology to enhance their growth prospects. One such company, Snowflake, is positioned to benefit from this trend, combined with the already high interest around cloud computing technology.\n\nI believe Snowflake is currently trading below its intrinsic value, with a decent margin of safety. This view is bolstered by analyst forecasts projecting 33% annual profit growth in the coming years. These factors, all things being equal, should contribute to increased cash flow and enhanced share value over time.\n\nAs a hyper-growth company succeeding in cloud data, Snowflake has captured the attention of Warren Buffett and his team as a key tech stock. Despite a lofty valuation multiple of 26 times sales, the company positions itself as a top growth stock. If Snowflake continues to generate market-beating growth over the next five years, the current valuation could prove to be justified.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Mettler-Toledo International, Inc. MTD is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 8.\r\n\r\nPer the preliminary information, both sales and adjusted earnings per share are expected to be below the previous guidance.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth quarter, MTD sales declined 12% on a reported basis and 13% in local currency year over year, according to the latest update provided by the company.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $979.3 million, indicating a decline of 7.4% from the year-ago period\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is projected at $10.32 per share, suggesting a 14.7% decline from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reading.\r\n\r\nWe note that MTD\u2019s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 2.2%.\n\nMettler-Toledo International, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Mettler-Toledo International, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMettler-Toledo International, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Mettler-Toledo International, Inc. Quote\n\nKey Factors to Consider\n\nMettler-Toledo\u2019s shipment delays, due to a new external European logistics service provider, are expected to have hurt its top line significantly in the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nFurther, the company\u2019s fourth-quarter results are likely to have reflected weakness in overall market demand, particularly in China.\r\n\r\nWeakening momentum in core end markets, such as life sciences and continuing soft economic conditions in Europe and the Americas, are expected to have negatively impacted the company\u2019s performance outside of China in the upcoming results.\r\n\r\nSluggish demand in automated chemistry, analytical instruments and process analytics businesses is likely to have affected the Laboratory segment\u2019s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s sluggish Industrial segment, owing to tough growth comparisons and weaker market demand for core industrial products, particularly in China and America, is expected to have been a major headwind for the company\u2019s top-line growth during the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nDecreasing sales volume and a reset in its variable compensation programs are likely to have been negatives for the company in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nHowever, growing momentum across its Food Retail segment, driven by significant project activity, is expected to have driven the company\u2019s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nMTD\u2019s robust sales and marketing strategies, cost-cutting efforts and innovative portfolio are likely to have acted as major tailwinds for the company during the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nIncreasing demand for the company\u2019s LabX software, driven by growing momentum in automation and digitalization end-markets, is expected to have aided MTD\u2019s performance in the quarter under review.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that\u2019s not the case here.\r\n\r\nMettler-Toledo has an Earnings ESP of -9.67% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nHere are some companies worth considering from the same space, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in their soon-to-be-reported quarterly results.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike CRWD has an Earnings ESP of +0.53% and a Zacks Rank #1 at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2023 results on Mar 5. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CRWD\u2019s earnings is pegged at 82 cents per share, suggesting a jump of 74.5% from the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nTwilio TWLO has an Earnings ESP of +31.37% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present.\r\n\r\nTwilo is set to announce fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 14. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TWLO\u2019s earnings is pinned at 57 cents per share, indicating growth from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure of 22 cents per share.\r\n\r\nExpedia Group EXPE has an Earnings ESP of +5.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\r\n\r\nExpedia Group is set to announce fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 8. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EXPE\u2019s earnings is pinned at $1.67 per share, suggesting a rise of 32.5% from the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "AUSTIN, Texas, February 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD) today announced it has been recognized as the only Customers\u2019 Choice in the 2024 Gartner Peer Insights\u2122 Voice of the Customer for Vulnerability Assessment among eight other providers. The AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae XDR platform harnesses AI to prioritize risks in real time across the entire attack surface \u2013 both internal and external \u2013 without the complex, scanning infrastructure required by legacy vulnerability management providers.\n\nToday\u2019s adversaries can weaponize vulnerabilities in minutes or hours as opposed to days or weeks. Reliance on the legacy, reactive approaches to vulnerability assessment can amplify organizational risk. CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Exposure Management unifies real-time security and IT data sets from Falcon Surface (External Attack Surface Management), Falcon Discover (Asset, Account and App Discovery) and Falcon Spotlight (Vulnerability Management), as well as CrowdStrike\u2019s renowned threat intelligence, endpoint and XDR telemetry to predict attack paths and guide risk mitigation actions that stop breaches before they happen.\n\n\"Reactive scan-first approaches to identifying and mitigating vulnerability risk are no longer good enough against today\u2019s adversary. Organizations need to proactively identify vulnerabilities and potential attack paths and shut them down before they can be exploited by fast moving adversaries,\" said Raj Rajamani, head of products at CrowdStrike. \"Our unified platform approach stands out against the legacy vulnerability management companies and resonates with organizations that want to consolidate point products and stop vulnerabilities from turning into breaches.\"\n\nCrowdStrike customer reviews include:\n\n\"CrowdStrike Falcon Spotlight stands as a robust vulnerability management solution, rooted in the cloud, and enhanced by an integrated sensor that provides a comprehensive perspective of our enterprise's attack surface and the surrounding threat landscape. Furthermore, I've observed its user-friendly nature and seamless compatibility with various security solutions. In summary, this product is particularly well-suited for organizations seeking to augment their EDR solution with this valuable add-on feature.\" \u2013 IT Security and Risk Manager in Media \"If you want to research, assess or report the vulnerabilities in your environment then go for Falcon Spotlight. One of the best tools I have ever used to overcome the challenges of vulnerability management. It supports all OS platforms and is real-time based.\" \u2013 IT Leader in Manufacturing \"We have implemented the CrowdStrike Spotlight feature to gain better visibility into our vulnerabilities through CrowdStrike. It provides great prioritization for what vulnerabilities you should be prioritizing first if you do not know where to start.\" \u2013 IT, Security and Risk Manager in Media\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nTo learn more about the 2024 Gartner Peer Insights\u2122 Voice of the Customer for Vulnerability Assessment Report, visit the CrowdStrike website.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 7, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Vertiv VRT, CrowdStrike CRWD, and Arista Networks ANET.\n\n3 Buy-Rated Stocks Outperforming the Magnificent 7\n\nThe Magnificent 7 (Apple, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, Microsoft, Tesla, NVIDIA, and Amazon) group has been the dominant story of the market for some time now, performing remarkably and providing stellar gains. They\u2019ve led the market, with recent quarterly results from a few members adding further excitement and extending the positive price action.\n\nThanks to their dominant market stance, outperforming the group has been nearly impossible. However, that certainly hasn\u2019t been the case for all, including Vertiv, CrowdStrike, and Arista Networks.\n\nAll three stocks have outperformed the Magnificent 7 as a group over the last year.\n\nIn addition, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, reflecting upward trending earnings estimate revisions. For those seeking to outperform the market titans, let\u2019s take a closer look at each.\n\nArista Networks\n\nArista Networks, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is an industry leader in data-driven, client-to-cloud networking for large data centers, campus, and routing environments. The revisions trend has been particularly bullish for its current fiscal year outlook, up 13% to $6.55 per share over the last year.\n\nThe company\u2019s quarterly consistency can\u2019t be overlooked, exceeding both top and bottom line consensus expectations in each of its last ten releases. The company\u2019s top line has enjoyed significant expansion over the last few quarters thanks to customer momentum in both enterprise and cloud/AI sectors.\n\nKeep an eye out for the company\u2019s next quarterly release scheduled for February 12th, as current consensus expectations currently suggest 21% earnings growth on 20% higher sales. Analysts have taken their bottom line expectations modestly higher since last November.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is a leader in next-generation endpoint protection, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Like ANET, the revisions trend for CrowdStrike\u2019s current fiscal year has been robust, up 46% to $2.95 per share over the last year.\n\nThe stock remains a prime consideration for growth investors, currently carrying a Style Score of \u2018A\u2019 for Growth. Consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggest 90% earnings growth paired with a sizable 36% revenue climb.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s latest set of quarterly results had shares moving higher post-earnings, with the company delivering record profitability and record free cash flow. Annual recurring revenue also showed considerable growth, improving 35% year-over-year.\n\nShares have jumped higher post-earnings in back-to-back releases.\n\nVertiv\n\nVertiv, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a global leader in designing, building, and servicing critical infrastructure that enables vital applications for data centers. The company is the only pure-play data center infrastructure provider able to deliver across the entire spectrum of thermal and power technologies.\n\nShares aren\u2019t valuation stretched given the company\u2019s forecasted growth, with shares currently trading at a 27.1X forward earnings multiple (F1). Consensus expectations for its current year allude to a 220% pop in earnings on 21% higher sales.\n\nThe company\u2019s top line expansion has already been impressive, posting double-digit percentage year-over-year revenue growth rates in six consecutive quarterly releases.\n\nVertiv will deliver its next set of quarterly results on February 21st. Current consensus expectations suggest 90% earnings growth and 14% expansion across the top line. Shares have moved higher post-earnings in three consecutive releases.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile most market headlines are centered around the Magnificent 7 group, investors may be surprised to learn that there have been other stocks delivering even stronger gains.\n\nAll three stocks above have precisely done that, delivering \u2018Mag 7-beating\u2019 gains over the last year.\n\nIn addition, all three sport favorable Zacks Ranks, with upwards trending earnings estimate revisions helping drive the moves.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

        "content": "Dynatrace DT is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 8.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal third quarter, non-GAAP earnings are projected between 27-28 cents per share.\r\n\r\nRevenues are estimated to be between $356 million and $359 million, indicating a 19-20% increase at constant currency.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter earnings has been unchanged at 28 cents per share in the past 30 days, suggesting 12% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nDynatrace, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Dynatrace, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nDynatrace, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Dynatrace, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter Subscription revenues is pegged at $341 million, indicating a 22.2% increase year over year.\r\n\r\nDynatrace continues to expand its product portfolio by introducing capabilities and enhancements, which are likely to have been key growth drivers. Continuous investment in security expansion and go-to-market initiatives are expected to have driven its net expansion rate and contributed to ARR growth.\r\n\r\nDynatrace\u2019s strong partner base is likely to have contributed to its fiscal third-quarter performance. The company's growing collaborations with hyperscales like Microsoft to leverage the power of generative AI and predictive analytics with secure enterprise-ready offerings are expected to have been a tailwind.\r\n\r\nHowever, persistent macroeconomic volatility and challenges related to foreign exchange are expected to have hurt top-line growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

        "content": "The Magnificent 7 (Apple, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, Microsoft, Tesla, NVIDIA, and Amazon) group has been the dominant story of the market for some time now, performing remarkably and providing stellar gains. They\u2019ve led the market, with recent quarterly results from a few members adding further excitement and extending the positive price action.\n\nThanks to their dominant market stance, outperforming the group has been nearly impossible. However, that certainly hasn\u2019t been the case for all, including Vertiv VRT, CrowdStrike CRWD, and Arista Networks ANET.\n\nAll three stocks have outperformed the Magnificent 7 as a group over the last year, as we can see illustrated below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn addition, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, reflecting upward trending earnings estimate revisions. For those seeking to outperform the market titans, let\u2019s take a closer look at each.\n\nArista Networks\n\nArista Networks, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is an industry leader in data-driven, client-to-cloud networking for large data centers, campus, and routing environments. The revisions trend has been particularly bullish for its current fiscal year outlook, up 13% to $6.55 per share over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company\u2019s quarterly consistency can\u2019t be overlooked, exceeding beat both top and bottom line consensus expectations in each of its last ten releases. The company\u2019s top line has enjoyed significant expansion over the last few quarters thanks to customer momentum in both enterprise and cloud/AI sectors. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKeep an eye out for the company\u2019s next quarterly release scheduled for February 12th, as current consensus expectations currently suggest 21% earnings growth on 20% higher sales. Analysts have taken their bottom line expectations modestly higher since last November. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is a leader in next-generation endpoint protection, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Like ANET, the revisions trend for CrowdStrike\u2019s current fiscal year has been robust, up 46% to $2.95 per share over the last year.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe stock remains a prime consideration for growth investors, currently carrying a Style Score of \u2018A\u2019 for Growth. Consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggest 90% earnings growth paired with a sizable 36% revenue climb. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s latest set of quarterly results had shares moving higher post-earnings, with the company delivering record profitability and record free cash flow. Annual recurring revenue also showed considerable growth, improving 35% year-over-year.\n\nShares have jumped higher post-earnings in back-to-back releases. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nVertiv\n\nVertiv, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a global leader in designing, building, and servicing critical infrastructure that enables vital applications for data centers. The company is the only pure-play data center infrastructure provider able to deliver across the entire spectrum of thermal and power technologies.\n\nShares aren\u2019t valuation stretched given the company\u2019s forecasted growth, with shares currently trading at a 27.1X forward earnings multiple (F1). Consensus expectations for its current year allude to a 220% pop in earnings on 21% higher sales.\n\nThe company\u2019s top line expansion has already been impressive, posting double-digit percentage year-over-year revenue growth rates in six consecutive quarterly releases. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nVertiv will deliver its next set of quarterly results on February 21st. Current consensus expectations suggest 90% earnings growth and 14% expansion across the top line. Shares have moved higher post-earnings in three consecutive releases. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile most market headlines are centered around the Magnificent 7 group, investors may be surprised to learn that there have been other stocks delivering even stronger gains.\n\nAll three stocks above \u2013 Vertiv VRT, CrowdStrike CRWD, and Arista Networks ANET \u2013 have precisely done that, delivering \u2018Mag 7-beating\u2019 gains over the last year.\n\nIn addition, all three sport favorable Zacks Ranks, with upwards trending earnings estimate revisions helping drive the moves.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In the latest trading session, CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) closed at $302.49, marking a -0.36% move from the previous day. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.32%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.71%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.2%.\n\nThe cloud-based security company's shares have seen an increase of 22.67% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 9.33% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.59%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of CrowdStrike Holdings in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on March 5, 2024. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $0.82, reflecting a 74.47% increase from the same quarter last year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $839.08 million, indicating a 31.65% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for CrowdStrike Holdings. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 1.19% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. CrowdStrike Holdings is holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) right now.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, CrowdStrike Holdings is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 83.1. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 31.21, which means CrowdStrike Holdings is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also note that CRWD has a PEG ratio of 2.3 right now. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Internet - Software industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.68.\n\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 80, positioning it in the top 32% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nEnsure to harness Zacks.com to stay updated with all these stock-shifting metrics, among others, in the next trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why CrowdStrike (CRWD) is Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates Again",
        "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nThis cloud-based security company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 21.48%.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, CrowdStrike came out with earnings of $0.82 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.74 per share, representing a surprise of 10.81%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.56 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.74 per share, delivering a surprise of 32.14%.\n\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for CrowdStrike lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nCrowdStrike has an Earnings ESP of +0.53% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on March 5, 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Want to start the week ahead of the pack? Check out Momentum Mondays, where I cover the leading breakout stocks in the market, summarize the major events of the week ahead, and prepare investors for profitable trading.\n\nToday, we will be taking a look at the broad stock market indexes to summarize the action of the last few weeks, then we will look at the economic calendar and earnings releases to address any market moving data coming our way. And finally, I will share four compelling technical trade setups in stocks with top Zacks Ranks.\n\nEconomic Data\n\nIt is a fairly light week in regard to economic data, highlighted by a number of Fed speakers throughout the week. There will be 11 occasions on which a member of the Fed board gives a speech with four on Tuesday and five on Wednesday.\n\nIn terms of actual data, on Monday we get ISM and PMI services, on Wednesday US trade deficit and Consumer Credit, and Initial Jobless Claims on Thursday.\n\nEarnings reports are numerous this week as well. Notable reports include:\n\nMonday: McDonald\u2019s Corporation, Caterpillar Inc., and Palantir Technologies.\n\nTuesday: Eli Lilly and Company, Toyota Motor Company, Chipotle Mexican Grill and Amgen Inc.\n\nWednesday: Alibaba, The Walt Disney Company, Uber Technologies, PayPal Holdings, and Yum Brands.\n\nThursday: S&P Global, Philip Morris International, and Duke Energy Corporation.\n\nFriday: PepsiCo, Enbridge, and Honda Motor Co.\n\nBroad Market Update\n\nFollowing last week\u2019s FOMC meeting, equities first experienced a decent little sell-off, which was followed by aggressive buying into the end of the week, pushing stock indexes to new all-time highs.\n\nI am definitely erring on the more cautious side in stocks, as this rally has pushed higher without any significant pullbacks for three months now. However, that is not a reason to go and short this market, as the price action is clearly still pointing higher. Additionally, for investors holding on to winning stocks, it might be worth bumping up those trailing stops for when the market does inevitably correct.\n\nStory continues\n\nI am watching this upward trending channel in the S&P 500 SPY (similar setup in the Nasdaq 100) to gauge sentiment. If the market can break below the lower bound, I will get much more defensive, although a test of 5,000 first feels highly likely. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nThere were some significant developments at last week\u2019s FOMC meeting, as Jerome Powell further tempered interest rate cut expectations. Considering the persistent strength in the labor and wage market, the committee made more clear that the odds of a rate hike in March are falling.\n\nThe futures market reflects that, and in the FedWatch tool below, we can see that the odds of a March rate cut have fallen from 64% a month ago, to just 17% now. Odds of a May rate cut now stand at 60%.\n\nSlightly more hawkish rhetoric from the Fed, and thus higher interest rates could act as a headwind for stocks between now and the next meeting in mid-March. CME Group\n\nImage Source: CME Group\n\nTechnical Setups\n\nFollowing the trend over the last few weeks, I will share four trading setups. The first two represent stocks with a more aggressive tilt, that should outperform if the market continues to rally, and the other two are more defensive, and should outperform if the market begins to correct.\n\nNetflix NFLX has formed a compelling bull flag following a strong earnings gap up. If Netflix stock can trade and close above the $570 level, it would signal a technical breakout. Alternatively, if the share price of Netflix breaks down below the $561 level of support, the setup is invalid, and investors may want to seek opportunities elsewhere. TradingView.com\n\nImage Source: TradingView.com\n\nCrowdStrike CRWD, the cybersecurity firm has a very nice technical setup as well. Over the last two weeks, the stock has built a clean bullish consolidation. If CrowdStrike stock can trade and close above the $305 level, it would signal a breakout. However, below the $290 level of support and the setup is invalid. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nThe Progressive PGR stock has been on a tear since mid-way through 2023, barely ticking down since then. The stock continues to build bullish patterns, and over the last nine days has formed a clean bullish consolidation. A break above $181.50 should send the stock to another new high, but below $176, and it should be avoided. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nFinally, Textron TXT, an aerospace manufacturer, has formed a compelling bullish pattern after a strong earnings gap up. Above $86.50 and the stock should make a swift move higher. Alternatively, a break below $84.50 would invalidate the setup. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nBottom Line\n\nEven the best trading setups fail, so it is always important for traders to prioritize making a trading plan, following the plan, and utilizing strict risk management protocols.\n\nGood luck this week traders!\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "5 Software Stocks Likely to Top Earnings Estimates This Season",
        "content": "Software is ubiquitous and has become the focal point of technological innovation. Software stocks have been benefiting from accelerated demand for digital transformation and the ongoing shift to the cloud. However, weakened consumer spending amid ongoing macroeconomic headwinds is hurting industry participants. Enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid inflationary pressure, higher interest rates and unfavorable forex. These do not bode well for industry participants this earnings season.\r\n\r\nThe high demand for Software as a Service or SaaS-based solutions due to the mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model is noteworthy. The growing demand for solutions that support hybrid operating environments, including voice and video communication and productivity software, and online payment solutions are likely to have remained major tailwinds for software companies like CrowdStrike CRWD, Ringcentral RNG, Twilio TWLO, Cadence Design Systems CDNS and Snap SNAP.\n\nWhat's Driving Software Stocks?\n\nThe spike in the adoption of cloud-based services, the increasing proliferation of IoT and AR/VR devices and the accelerated deployment of 5G are expected to have aided the performance of software stocks this earnings season.\r\n\r\nRapid digitalization, driven by the pandemic, has increased the demand for cloud-based applications, virtualized software and container-based software. Applications are being developed in the cloud, which is creating opportunities and, at the same time, challenges for industry participants in terms of performance and security.\r\n\r\nStrong momentum across enterprise collaboration software, remote desktop tools, natural language processing tool, time tracking tools and cybersecurity software is expected to have hugely favored the software industry this earnings season.\r\n\r\nRising cyber-attacks, including Distributed Denial of Service attacks and attacks using malware through Transport Layer Security and Secure Sockets Layer protocols, are redefining the cyber threat landscape. Enterprises are spending more on cloud-based security solutions. Moreover, the software-defined approach is increasingly getting preferred over legacy hardware-centric models due to the need for agility.\r\n\r\nThe increasing customer-centric approach is allowing end-users to perform all required actions with minimal intervention from software providers. The pay-as-you-go model helps Internet Software providers scale their offerings per the needs of different users. The subscription-based business model ensures recurring revenues for the industry participants. The affordability of the SaaS delivery model, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, is another major driver.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, the growing proliferation of AI-powered voice recognition, telemedicine, learning management, infrastructure monitoring and business spend management software is expected to have benefited industry players in the quarter under review.

        "content": "Hacking is a huge problem. In 2023, some of the world's largest organizations were attacked, and the results were devastating.\n\nMGM Resorts International was hacked in September 2023, resulting in operational disruptions that lasted several hours and cost the company over $100 million in lost revenue.\n\nAlso in September 2023, Johnson Controls was hit with a ransomware attack that crippled the company's IT infrastructure. Johnson Controls was ultimately forced to delay its earnings release due to the breach. Moreover, the damage from the attack resulted in a $60 million impact to earnings.\n\nAs these examples show, cybersecurity threats are all too real, and corporations are taking them very seriously. This has led many to invest heavily in the products that cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) produce. Here's a closer look at why it's one of the leading cybersecurity companies and why its stock has increased more than 415% over the last five years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe history of CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD) was incorporated in 2011 in Austin, Texas. Led by CEO and founder George Kurtz, CrowdStrike has staked its own path within the cybersecurity industry.\n\nKurtz, who worked at McAfee from 2004 to 2011, oversaw an innovative strategy at CrowdStrike. As noted in the company's 2023 annual report:\n\nOur approach has defined a new category called the Security Cloud, which has the power to transform the cybersecurity industry the same way the cloud has transformed the customer relationship management, human resources, and service management industries. Using cloud-scale AI, our Security Cloud enriches and correlates trillions of cybersecurity events per week with indicators of attack, threat intelligence and enterprise data (including data from across endpoints, workloads, identities, IT assets and configurations) to create actionable information, identify shifts in adversary tactics and automatically detect and prevent threats in real-time across our customer base. The more data that is fed into our Falcon platform, the more intelligent our Security Cloud becomes, and the more our customers benefit, creating a powerful network effect that increases the overall value we provide.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn short, CrowdStrike offers customers value by offering subscriptions to its cloud-based, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered security modules. This benefits customers in numerous ways:\n\nFrictionless deployment: CrowdStrike's platform and modules can be rapidly introduced via a non-intrusive, \"frictionless deployment.\" Powerful network effect: The more data CrowdStrike's systems have, the more effective they become. This is true not only across one customer, but also across CrowdStrike's entire customer base. Consolidation improves security: Siloed security products (across endpoints and networks) lead to \"bolt-on\" solutions that can create blind spots. CrowdStrike's platform sees the entire picture, preventing blind spots. Lower costs: By consolidating security under one umbrella, organizations can save money.\n\nCrowdStrike's business is booming\n\nWith cybersecurity top of mind for many organizations, CrowdStrike has capitalized on the moment and is growing by leaps and bounds. Revenue, for example, has surged 10x over the last five years, from $250 million in 2019 to $2.8 billion as of this writing. Similarly, CrowdStrike's free cash flow -- which was negative in 2019 -- now stands at $3.59 a share. CRWD Chart\n\nCrowdStrike's stock price has increased, too. Shares are up 185% over the last year and 415% since the company's initial public offering (IPO) -- equating to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of better than 42%. What's more, analysts expect the company's sales to rise 36% this year and a further 29% in 2025, as demand for AI-powered cybersecurity continues to grow.\n\nAll that said, CrowdStrike isn't a stock to trade -- it's one to own. Although it's not a good match for every investor or portfolio, long-term growth-oriented investors should consider it an excellent stock to buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CrowdStrike wasn't one of them.
