        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Top-Tier Billionaires Are Selling It and Piling Into 2 Ultra-High-Yield Dividend Stocks Instead",
        "content": "One of the best aspects about putting your money to work on Wall Street is that there's a path for everyone to make money. Regardless of your risk tolerance or interests, there's bound to be individual stocks and/or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that can help you reach your goal of financial independence.\n\nBut among these countless strategies, few have lined investor's pockets more than buying and holding high-quality dividend stocks over extended periods.\n\nRecently, the investment advisors at Hartford Funds refreshed a data set from their 2023 report (\"The Power of Dividends, Past, Present, and Future\") that compared the performance of income stocks to non-payers over an extended period. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAccording to the analysis conducted by Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, dividend stocks have averaged a 9.17% annual return over the last 50 years (1973-2023), and did so while being 6% less volatile than the broad-based S&P 500. This more than doubled up the 4.27% annualized return of non-payers over the prior half-century.\n\nThe long-term outperformance of income stocks isn't lost on Wall Street's smartest (and richest) investors. Thanks to quarterly Form 13F filings, everyday investors can get an under-the-hood look at what top-tier billionaire money managers have been buying and selling in the latest quarter.\n\nYou might be surprised to learn that while more than a half-dozen prominent billionaires were dumping shares of artificial intelligence (AI) kingpin Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) during the March-ended quarter, they were absolutely piling into two ultra-high-yield dividend stocks, which sport a scorching-hot average yield of 10.78%!\n\nEight billionaire money managers have begun kicking Nvidia to the curb\n\nArguably, there isn't a hotter trend on Wall Street right now than artificial intelligence. Nvidia's market cap has skyrocketed by more than $2.4 trillion since the start of 2023 solely because of its dominance in AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nNvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have quickly become the standard in high-compute data centers. With its Blackwell chip and Rubin platform set to make their respective debuts later this year and in 2026, there's a good likelihood Nvidia will sustain the compute advantage that's made it a popular early choice among businesses wanting to run generative AI solutions and train large language models.\n\nIn spite of this early success, eight prominent billionaire asset managers dumped shares of Nvidia during the first quarter (total shares sold in parenthesis have been adjusted for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June):\n\nStory continues\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (29,370,600 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (24,627,160 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (7,200,040 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (4,415,510 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (4,208,010 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa (3,480,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (3,045,050 shares)\n\nHistory could be one reason why Wall Street's brightest investors have begun to change their tune on Nvidia. For 30 years, we've watched investors consistently overestimate the utility and enterprise adoption of new technologies, innovations, and trends. It's going to take some time for AI to mature, and for businesses to develop a game plan of how to grow their sales and profits using this technology. Long story short, the AI bubble is probably going to burst sooner, rather than later.\n\nThese eight billionaire money managers are likely also anticipating an uptick in competition in high-compute data centers. On top of external competition, Nvidia's largest customers are developing AI-GPUs for their respective data centers. Even with its clear-cut compute advantage, Nvidia is set to lose precious data center \"real estate\" to other chips going forward.\n\nWhile billionaires were busy sending shares of Nvidia to the chopping block in the March-ended quarter, they opportunistically purchased shares of two high-octane dividend stocks instead. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAnnaly Capital Management: 13.09% yield\n\nThe first ultra-high-yield dividend stock top-tier billionaires chose to purchase as they were dumping shares of AI titan Nvidia is mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) Annaly Capital Management(NYSE: NLY). Annaly is yielding north of 13%, has declared $26 billion in cumulative dividends since its initial public offering (IPO) in October 1997, and had two prominent billionaire buyers in the first quarter (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (818,820 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (465,045 shares)\n\nAlthough mortgage REITs are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and have been weighed down by the longest inversion of the Treasury yield curve on record, a proverbial light at the end of the tunnel is emerging.\n\nFor starters, the yield curve historically spends a disproportionate amount of time sloped up and to the right. In other words, longer-dated bonds typically sport higher yields than Treasury bills set to mature in a year or less. Eventually, the yield curve will normalize, and Annaly Capital Management should enjoy an expansion of its net interest margin and an increase of its book value. The latter is noteworthy given that the share price of mortgage REITs tends to hover close to their book value.\n\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve is nearing a rate-easing cycle. Mortgage REITs tend to perform their best when interest rates are declining and the Federal Reserve is telegraphing its monetary policy moves in a slow and transparent manner. Short-term borrowing costs should fall as rates decline, leading to an eventual widening of Annaly's net interest margin.\n\nBut the real secret sauce for Annaly is its focus on agency assets. An \"agency\" security (e.g., mortgage-backed securities) is backed by the federal government in the unlikely event of a default. This added protection allows Annaly to lever its investments, when prudent, which helps it sustain its double-digit yield.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance: 8.46% yield\n\nThe second ultra-high-yield dividend stock billionaire investors piled into while they were sending shares of Nvidia to the chopping block is battered pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA). Not to sound like a broken record, but the two billionaire buyers include (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,123,806 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (1,005,313 shares)\n\nThe catalyst behind Walgreens Boots Alliance's surging yield is the abysmal performance of its stock. Since yield is a function of payout relative to share price, being the worst-performing member of the S&P 500 in the first-half of 2024 sent the company's yield soaring -- even following a near-halving of its quarterly payout when the year began.\n\nWalgreens is contending with a number of headwinds, which includes growing competition from online pharmacies, an increase in theft (\"shrinkage\") in some of its stores, and high levels of debt/operating lease liabilities. These challenges have led Walgreens' management team to implement a laundry list of changes.\n\nIn addition to expected cost-cutting and store closures, Walgreens is focusing its efforts on building out its healthcare services segment, The company has partnered with, and invested in, VillageMD to open full-service clinics co-located in its stores. While this has been a bumpy transition that resulted in an unsightly goodwill writedown during the fiscal second quarter (ended Feb. 29, 2024), the margins and long-term growth potential associated with healthcare services are promising.\n\nWalgreens resolved another long-standing issue when it hired former Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth as its new chief. Whereas Walgreens' prior CEO Rosalind Brewer lacked a background in healthcare, Wentworth brings decades of experience to the table. Investors may not appreciate Wentworth ripping off the proverbial Band-Aid, but it's a necessary move to get Walgreens back on track.\n\nBillionaires Griffin and Englander might also be enamored with Walgreens Boots Alliance's bargain-basement valuation. Shares are valued at 25% below book value and trade at roughly 6 times consensus earnings per share for the following fiscal year.\n\nAlthough a turnaround won't happen overnight, the puzzle pieces are in place.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The extended bull market we are in has not been one where a rising tide lifts all boats. The S&P 500 is up 15% year-to-date and is 52% higher since October 2022 when the latest run-up began.\n\nWhile a lot of the gains for the benchmark index can be tied to how well the Magnificent Seven stocks are doing, many underperforming S&P 500 stocks are just behaving abysmally. There are problems with their business, or they are being especially adversely impacted by macroeconomic factors.\n\nBelow are three underperforming S&P 500 stocks that were down 30% or more in the second quarter. They were the worst-performing stocks on the index. But since they are offering extreme discounts, let\u2019s see if they are worth diving into now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEPAM Systems (EPAM) The logo for Epam Systems is seen on the side of an office building.\n\nSource: Tricky_Shark / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of information technology services provider EPAM Systems (NASDAQ:EPAM) tumbled 30.5% in the second quarter. While they bounced 9% higher in July, EPAM stock has yet to reach the level it was at two months ago before reporting first-quarter results.\n\nDespite the IT stock beating analyst estimates for the period, its guidance for the second quarter and full-year underwhelmed the market. EPAM forecasts a 2.6% decline in Q2 sales and a better than 1% drop in revenue for all of 2024. It guided full-year revenue toward a range of $4.575 billion and $4.675 billion.\n\nThat is mainly because \u201cclient demand is not improving to the degree originally expected.\u201d Yet analysts see that as an industry-wide issue and not a problem of EPAM per se.\n\nMizuho analysts still maintained their strong buy rating on the stock, though EPAM\u2019s one-year price target was reduced to $282 from $345 per share. The stock currently trades at $205 per share, implying 37% gains are still possible.\n\nBuilders FirstSource (BLDR) Builders FirstSource (BLDR) exterior and trademark logo.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe second-worst underperforming S&P 500 stock is Builders FirstSource (NASDAQ:BLDR), a homebuilders supply company. Shares were down 33.7% in the second quarter also because of earnings.\n\nLike EPAM Systems, the building supplies company beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom line but offered up disappointing guidance. Revenue of $3.89 billion was basically flat year-over-year but ahead of analyst forecasts for $3.82 billion in sales. Earnings also fell more than 10% to $2.65 per share but beat Wall Street\u2019s $2.30 per share outlook. Management noted on its earnings conference call that \u201cearly momentum in single-family (homes) has slowed.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s troubling because Builders FirstSource also saw a dramatic decline in multifamily housing activity in the first quarter. The segment fell 13%, eliminating its gains in single-family home construction. With single-family homes likely to decline, the future is looking more difficult.\n\nAlthough the stock collapsed in the second quarter, it bounced higher in July, rising nearly 11%. However, it remains down over 7% for the year.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe worst underperforming S&P 500 stock in the second quarter was pharmacy retail chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), which lost 44% of its value. And unlike the other two stocks, it continues to fall this month, down another 8%.\n\nGoing from bad to worse is nothing new for Walgreens, which lost over half of its market capitalization in 2024. It has taken body blow after body blow, especially after slashing its dividend to save money. And because it is still paying out over $860 million annually to support the remaining dividend, analysts believe additional cuts \u2014 or even suspending it altogether \u2014 may be in the cards.\n\nIt\u2019s a bitter pill for the company and its investors to swallow. Walgreens had been a Dividend Aristocrat with a near-50-year record of raising the payout. However, as it slims down further to save money, future cuts or a suspension may be just what the doctor ordered.\n\nThe pharmacy chain has all but abandoned its ownership stake in Village MD, announced it would close an unspecified number of money-losing stores, and warned about its profit outlook. It has also decided to keep its U.K.-based Boots pharmacy chain.\n\nInvestors were disappointed Walgreens didn\u2019t sell or spin off the U.K. business to focus on its U.S. healthcare operations. As it spirals lower, there\u2019s no reason to buy WBA stock. A bottom has yet to be reached.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in WBA stock.

        "content": "Investors should take full advantage of the current downturn in Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) and buy the stock. Super Micro Computer stock is going through a rough patch right now due to ongoing market volatility and a move away from highflying tech concerns.\n\nSince July 18, SMCI stock has fallen 15%. The decline is due to sector rotation, not fundamental issues with Super Micro Computer. Investors should buy-the-dip in this leading AI play without hesitation.\n\nBullish Outlook\n\nEven with the current pullback, Super Micro Computer stock has had an incredible run this year. Since January, SMCI stock has gained 150%. The stock continues to be the best performer in the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalysts see plenty of upside ahead. The median price target on Super Micro Computer stock is nearly 40% higher than where the shares presently trade.\n\nThe stock\u2019s surge is fueled by strong growth driven by demand for Super Micro Computer\u2019s high-efficiency servers used for AI. In its May earnings report, Super Micro Computer reported that its revenue rose 200% year over year.\n\nThe company\u2019s guidance for this year implies revenue growth of 582% at the midpoint. Super Micro Computer is scheduled to report earnings next on Aug. 6 and analysts are bracing for another blockbuster print.\n\nNasdaq 100 Inclusion\n\nIt might seem surprising, but 18 months ago Super Micro Computer was a small-cap stock trading on the Russell 2000 index.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth has been so meteoric that earlier this year, its stock joined the S&P 500 for the first time, immediately becoming the index\u2019s best performer.\n\nMore recently, SMCI stock was added to the Nasdaq 100 index, replacing Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA).\n\nSuper Micro Computer began trading on the Nasdaq 100 on July 22. The Nasdaq 100 is comprised of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies in the broader Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 is good news as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that track the index are required to buy its shares.\n\nThe index additions come as Super Micro Computers\u2019 market capitalization, which currently stands at $41.67 billion, has gotten too big to ignore.\n\nBuy Super Micro Computer Stock\n\nWhile shares of Super Micro Computer are dropping amid a broader market pullback, the current decline is not due to issues within the company.\n\nOn a fundamental basis, SMCI stock remains intact. The story surrounding the company also continues to hold up as demand for its servers that run AI remains white hot.\n\nStory continues\n\nUpcoming earnings will be a test. If the company passes that test, its share price can be counted on to soar once again. For this reason, investors should buy-the-dip in Super Micro Computer stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Here are two ultra-high-yield dividend stocks down more than 50% over the last year.\n\nHigh yields, low valuations\n\nYou won't find many healthcare stocks with higher dividend yields than Medical Properties Trust(NYSE: MPW). The hospital-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) offers a dividend yield of nearly 12.3%. Meanwhile, pharmacy giant Walgreens Boots Alliance's (NASDAQ: WBA) dividend yields almost 8.9%.\n\nNeither company has such a high yield because it has boosted its dividend tremendously. Medical Properties Trust slashed its dividend in 2023. Walgreens cut its dividend nearly in half earlier this year.\n\nInstead, those ultra-high yields stem from huge sell-offs. Medical Properties Trust's share price has fallen a little over 50% since a year ago. Walgreens stock has plunged more than 60% over the last 12 months.\n\nIn addition to pushing their dividend yields higher, the steep declines for Medical Properties Trust and Walgreens have given both stocks exceptionally low valuations. Medical Properties Trust's shares now trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of under 6.7. Walgreens' forward earnings multiple is below 5.2.\n\nBehind the declines\n\nRising interest rates contributed to Medical Properties Trust's decline. However, the biggest issue by far for the healthcare REIT is the precarious financial conditions of some of its top tenants.\n\nSteward Health Care ranks as Medical Properties Trust's largest tenant, accounting for 18.6% of the REIT's assets as of March 31, 2024. Steward filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2024.\n\nMedical Properties Trust's problems don't end with Steward, though. Prospect Medical Holdings is another tenant facing significant financial challenges. The hospital chain disclosed a few weeks ago that it's under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. Prospect made up 6.3% of Medical Properties Trusts' assets at the end of the first quarter.\n\nWalgreens' share price has fallen primarily due to a highly challenging operating environment. High inflation has caused consumers to tighten their purse strings. Walgreens has tried to run promotions and lower prices. While these efforts have helped drive more traffic, they've eaten into the company's profits.\n\nIn addition, some generic drug launches have negatively impacted Walgreens' pharmacy margins. At the same time, there has been lower overall market growth in the pharmacy industry while competition has increased.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre these ultra-high-yield dividend stocks dirt cheap buys now?\n\nThose ultra-high dividend yields offered by Medical Properties Trust and Walgreens Boots Alliance may be very tempting to income investors. The dirt cheap valuations could be enticing to value investors. However, it's important to understand the risks that both companies face.\n\nThe financial problems for Steward and, to a lesser extent, Prospect, are likely to weigh on Medical Properties Trust for a while to come. Walgreens doesn't anticipate marked improvement with its operating environment this year.\n\nThat said, Medical Properties Trust CEO Ed Aldag said in the company's Q1 earnings call he believes that Steward's bankruptcy process \"will facilitate the retenanting or sale of Steward hospitals in an orderly and timely fashion.\" He added that the REIT is \"pleased with the progress we are making with parties interested in the Steward hospitals.\"\n\nIf this process goes quickly, the dark cloud hovering over Medical Properties Trust will diminish significantly. A potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this year could also provide a catalyst for the stock.\n\nWalgreens plans to close underperforming stores over the next three years. It's reducing the number of brand partners and focusing more heavily on its own brands and preferred partners in the health and wellness categories. The company is also taking steps to hire top pharmacy school graduates.\n\nI wouldn't go as far as saying that either Medical Properties Trust or Walgreens are good picks to buy right now. There's simply too much uncertainty. However, it's possible that either or both stocks could deliver exceptional total returns over the next decade if their turnaround plans are successful.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Medical Properties Trust right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Medical Properties Trust, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Medical Properties Trust wasn\u2019t one of them.

(Operator Instructions) please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Reuben Treatman, Senior Director of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, Reuben.\n\nReuben Treatman\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Agree Realty's Second Quarter 2024 earnings call. Before turning the call over to Joey and Peter to discuss our results for the quarter, let me first run through the cautionary language. Please note that during this call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking under federal securities law, including statements related to our updated 2024 guidance.\r\nOur actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements for a number of reasons. Please see yesterday's earnings release and our SEC filings, including our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of various risks, uncertainties underlying our forward-looking statements.\r\nIn addition, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including core funds from operations or core FFO, adjusted funds from operations or AFFO and net debt to recurring EBITDA. Reconciliations of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings release website and SEC filings.\r\nI'll now turn the call over to Joey.\n\nJoel Agree\n\nThanks, Reuben, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm very pleased to report that we've had a strong first half of the year as our discipline has proven and warranted. On our last call, I mentioned our improved visibility into the acquisition market, and I'm pleased to say that visibility turned into high quality closed transactions at similar return profiles. Our team's efforts continue to produce unique and proprietary deal flow, and we continue to identify attractive investment opportunities across all three external growth platforms.\r\nAs mentioned, our investment activity during the quarter was supported by capital markets transactions that bolstered our fortress balance sheet with approximately $650 million of unsecured debt and equity capital. In addition, we received commitments to expand our revolving credit facility to $1.25 billion, which will provide us with pro forma total liquidity of $1.7 billion.\r\nThis additional dry powder will enable us to execute our strategy for the remainder of the year and into 2025. At quarter end pro forma for our outstanding forward equity, our fortress balance sheet set at 4.1 times net debt to recurring EBITDA, providing us with unparalleled optionality as we continue to execute on our pipeline. Given our investment activity of nearly $345 million during the first half of the year. Our balance sheet and liquidity position, we've continued to aggregate an incredibly high-quality and robust pipeline.\r\nI am pleased to announce we've increased our acquisition guidance to approximately $700 million from $600 million previously, with a rapidly changing environment that number could prove conservative. However, I think it is prudent given the lack of visibility into fourth quarter acquisition activity and the rapid change in our cost of capital.\r\nWe will continue to be disciplined capital allocators and maintain our stringent underwriting standards. Given our liquidity profile, strong positioning of our balance sheet and portfolio performance, we have raised a sevenfold per share guidance to a range of $4.11 to $4.14 for the year. At the midpoint this represents a 4.4% year over year growth. Peter will provide more details the inputs on these numbers momentarily.\r\nTurning to our three external growth platforms. During the second quarter, we invested approximately $203 million in 70 high-quality retail net lease properties across our three external growth plans. This includes the acquisition of 47 assets for approximately $186 million. The properties acquired during the second quarter are leased to leading retailers operating in sectors, including home improvement, off-price, auto-parts, crafts and novelties and grocery.\r\nOur completed transactions to date and current pipeline are emblematic of our data-driven approach to sourcing opportunities and include a variety of different transaction structures, sale leasebacks with relationship tenants, several unique blend and extends shorter term high performing stores purchased at 50% of replacement costs, both new and repeat sellers as well as distressed developers. We continue to be the first and last call in a highly fragmented disjointed market.\r\nThe acquired properties had a weighted average cap rate of 7.7%, a 90 basis point increase year over year and a weighted average lease term of over nine years. Investment grade retailers accounted for nearly 60% of the annualized base rent acquired. Note that we are not including retailers such as Hobby Lobby and this investment grade percentage and do not imply show ratings to nonrated companies.\r\nThrough the first half of the year, we've invested $343 million across 102 retail net lease properties spanning 37 states and 24 retail sectors, approximately $309 million of our investment activities originated from our acquisition plan. During the quarter, we also commenced five development and DFP projects, representing committed capital of approximately $19 million in the fleet for development and DFP projects with total costs of $15 million.\r\nIn total, we had 25 projects either completed or under construction during the first half of the year, representing $101 million of committed capital, inclusive of the $66 million incurred through June 30. Our pipeline for both of these platform continues to grow quite significantly, and we are excited to further discuss in upcoming calls.\r\nSimilar to last quarter, we opportunistically dispose of assets at levels where we could redeploy proceeds at attractive spreads. During the quarter, we sold 10 properties for total gross proceeds of almost $37 million with a weighted average cap rate of 6.4%. These dispositions were opportunistic capital recycling of non-core assets. Generally leased to sub-investment grade or non-rated operators, including Mr. Carwash, and select Gerber Collision.\r\nOur decision to bolster our asset management capabilities, including executive additions and IT investments was prudent. On the asset management front, we executed new leases, extensions or options on approximately 300,000 square feet of gross leasable area during the quarter, including a Walmart Supercenter in Kimball, Tennessee.\r\nAdditionally, during the quarter, we executed a ground lease with no anticipated tenant improvement allowance for the leading quick service restaurant operator, which I am particularly called one of the chicken guys on last quarter's call for a portion of the former Bed Bath & Beyond parcel in Memphis, Tennessee. We are negotiating multiple letters of intent for the remaining parcels and we'll move to lease this quarter.\r\nAs previously discussed, we anticipate recapturing over 150% of the former Bed Bath & Beyond rent, further highlighting our ability to identify and underwrite value add real estate. As a result of our asset management team's efforts, our 2024 lease maturities now stand at just 0.1% of annualized base rents. Given the progress achieved year to date, our occupancy ticked up to a company record 99.8% at period end. We are now focused on a 2025 pending maturities.\r\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Peter and then we can open it up for questions.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeter Coughenour\n\nThank you, Joey. Starting with the balance sheet as Joey mentioned, we had a very active quarter in the capital markets, raising nearly $650 million of capital. In May, we completed a $450 million public bond offering comprised of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due in 2034. In connection with the offering, we terminated related swap agreements of $300 million, receiving over $4 million upon termination and reducing our effective interest.\r\nThe offering further staggered our maturities and extends our weighted average debt maturity to approximately seven years excluding the unsecured revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we sold over 3.2 million shares of forward equity via our ATM program, raising net proceeds of approximately $195 million.\r\nAs of June 30, we had approximately 7.1 million shares remaining to be settled under existing forward sale agreements, which are anticipated to raise net proceeds of over $430 million upon settlement. Recently, we further strengthened our balance sheet with commitments to increase our revolving credit facility from $1 billion to $1.25 billion with strong support from our key banking partners.\r\nThe facility includes an accordion option that will allow us to request additional lender commitments up to a total of $2 billion. The term of the facility will be extended to 2029, including extension options and our cost of borrowing will be reduced by five basis points based on our anticipated credit ratings and leverage ratio at the time of closing.\r\nOur capital markets transactions provide us with more than $1.7 billion of total liquidity, pro forma for the closing of our expanded $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, the previously mentioned outstanding forward equity and more than $24 million of cash on hand. As of quarter end Pro forma for the settlement of our outstanding forward equity net debt to recurring EBITDA was approximately 4.1 times, which is down two tenths of a turn from last quarter.\r\nExcluding the impact of unsettled forward equity, our net debt to recurring EBITDA was 4.9 times. Our total debt to enterprise value was approximately 30%, while our fixed charge coverage ratio, which includes principal amortization and the preferred dividend is very healthy at 4.7 times. We had only $43 million of floating rate exposure at quarter end via our revolver balance. And as a reminder, we have no material debt maturities until 2028. We're very well positioned to execute on our pipeline and stay well within our stated leverage range without any additional capital.\r\nMoving to earnings. Core FFO for the second quarter was $1.3 per share, representing a 5.7% year over year increase. AFFO per share for the second quarter increased 6.4% year over year to $1.4. Our results for the quarter include the recognition of approximately $2 million of lease termination fees from a financial institution. The tenant agreed to pay 100% of the remaining base rent due for the primary term of both ground leases on termination.\r\nWe've taken ownership of both buildings via determination without any incremental investment due to the ground lease structure. A letter of intent has already been executed on one of the properties and there is significant interest in the second from national operators. We view this as a great outcome for the company and indicative of our focus on identifying and acquiring high-quality retail real estate with long-term demand drivers.\r\nAs Joey mentioned, we have increased our full year 2024 FFO per share guidance range to $4.11 to $4.14. The updated midpoint represents 4.4% growth, an increase of 20 basis points from our initial guide. There are parameters on several other inputs in our earnings release, including acquisition and disposition volume, general and administrative expenses nonreimbursable real estate expenses, plus income tax and other tax expenses.\r\nAs a reminder, treasury stock is included within our diluted share count prior to settlement. If ATC stock trades above the net price of our outstanding forward equity offerings. The aggregate dilutive impact related to these offerings was minimal in the second quarter. However, our updated guidance range contemplates more meaningful treasury stock method dilution in the second half of the year and assumes that our stock continues to trade near current levels.\r\nUnder that scenario, again, assuming a stable stock price, we anticipate treasury stock method dilution will have an impact of roughly one penny on full year 2024 AFFO per share. Our ability to drive consistent earnings growth continues to support our growing and well-covered dividend. In April, we increased our monthly cash dividend to $0.25 per share, representing a 1.2% month-over-month increase.\r\nWe subsequently declared monthly cash dividends of $0.25 for each of May, June and July. The monthly dividend represents an annualized dividend amount of $3 per share and is almost 3% higher than the annualized dividend from the comparable periods last year. This growth comes as our AFFO payout ratio remains at 72% for the second consecutive quarter, enabling us to retain significant cash flow for reinvestment.\r\nAs mentioned on prior calls, free cash flow after the dividend for 2024 is approximately $100 million on an annualized basis. So to conclude, our well-positioned balance sheet affords us tremendous flexibility with pro forma net debt to EBITDA of 4.1 times and roughly $1.7 billion of liquidity to fund our robust investment pipeline.\r\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Joey.\n\nJoel Agree\n\nThank you, Peter. At this time, operator, we can open it up for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions)\r\nRonald Kamdem, Morgan.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nGreat. Congrats on the quarter and raising the guidance. Maybe just starting with acquisition, the guidance implies an acceleration in the second half of the year. Maybe can you give some comments on what you're seeing in the pipeline and sort of cap rate return.\n\nJoel Agree\n\nSure. Good morning, Ron. I'll tell you, look this has been, as I mentioned, a rapid ascent of our stock price here in a fairly dynamic market. Obviously, with a lot of crazy stuff going on. And so I think most importantly, we started sourcing for Q4 yesterday and Q3 sourcing stopped SEC yesterday as well. And so again, given the 70 days average letter of Intent execution to close, let's call -- give it another couple of weeks to negotiate a letter of intent. There's the basic transaction time line for you.\r\nWhat I'm excited about is now turning to Q4 with an improved cost of capital. It's been a 12 to 18 months here of a grid of teeth and cleanse jaws while we sit here and watch the stock price flounder and rates creep higher. And so we are -- we don't see any material macro changes yet on the cap rate horizon. But with an improved cost of capital, we certainly can lean into transactions that are high-quality and additive to the portfolio.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nAnd just on the cap rate, any cap rate trending commentary? Is it flat, getting better?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nFor Q3, I would anticipate a similar cap rate to Q2, that pipeline has effectively built subject to diligence and closing already. Q4, we're going to see what's out there. We start, like I said, we started yesterday.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nRight. If my second one is just on -- maybe can you comment on just the bad debt assumptions if any change to the watch list that. Have you sort of seen any sign that the low-end consumer may be under pressure. Is that -- are you hearing anything from sort of tenants on that front? Thanks.\n\nJoel Agree\n\nI think definitely, and I'll let Peter comment on the bad debt assumptions. The low end consumer has been under pressure. Undoubtedly, we really look at the consumer in three tranches, 50,000 median household income, 100,000 and over 150,000. And I think you see the pressure on the 50,000 that's reflected in the Dollar General performance. If you look at 100,000 in the Walmart core customer, they're getting trade down over one 150,000 seems to be strong, certainly due to the overall market environment and therefore [401,000s] and their portfolios being elevated with that market and so.\r\nThe low end consumer continues to struggle, you see it in the restaurant trends, you see in the Dollar General trends. But the middle of the road there, the $100,000 median household income. It's fairly strong but we're seeing the trade down effect there. And again, that's reflective in Walmart's performance to date. Go ahead Peter.\n\nPeter Coughenour\n\nRon, from a credit loss perspective in terms of what we're contemplated in guidance, we're still assuming approximately 50 basis points of credit loss in our guidance range. And again, that's fully loaded credit loss. So any form of us not receiving rent is contractually obligated is included in that 50 basis points. Year to date, we've experienced roughly 25 basis points of credit loss. So while the portfolio continues to below that 25 basis points in line roughly with our historical average, we thought it prudent to keep 50 basis points in our guidance for the time being.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. That's it for me.\n\nJoel Agree\n\nThanks, Rob.\n\nOperator\n\nSmedes Rose, Citi.\n\nSmedes Rose\n\nHi, thank you. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the acceleration in the pipeline you said and not a lot of change on the macro front. So, I mean is it really driven by what you described, I think last quarter is kind of the 3D and then very sort of active or proactive outbound calling on your part? And are you -- but it seems like the environment is maybe starting to stabilize a little bit more. I was just wondering if there's any sort of organic pickup in transaction activity that maybe is helping you out as well?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nYeah, Smedes, I agree with you. We see some stabilization, obviously in the 10-year treasury, which seems to be range-bound that could change tomorrow, but that stabilization does help the liquidity in the market and sellers' willingness to transact. But that said, that can change on a dime. Our transaction volume, as we mentioned on the Q1 call, would pick up in Q2 because transactions for Q1 going back to the time line are generally sourced during Q4 when we saw the roller coaster of the treasury peaking at 5%.\r\nAnd so that stabilization pulls through generally to the next quarter, again, given that transaction time line, and I think we'll see some pull through the Q3. And like I said, I'm excited for Q4 again, assuming a normalized environment here, which can be a tough assumption.\n\nSmedes Rose\n\nOkay. And then I just -- I wanted to ask you just you issued on the ATM during the quarter at prices about 10% lower. So where the stock is now. And I realize there's some relatively modest impact from the dilution methodology, but how are you thinking about potentially continuing to issue shares here, just as you maybe gear up for 2025.\n\nJoel Agree\n\nOur balance sheet's in a great position of pro forma 4.1 times levered, obviously, with pro forma $1.7 billion in liquidity, executing on the $450 million unsecured bond offering with no material debt maturities. This balance sheet is a fortress, we'll look to how we deploy in terms of your prior question in terms of uses, if we see the need for incremental capital will certainly look at the alternative options here. But again, we are locked and loaded from a balance sheet perspective from any angle.\n\nSmedes Rose\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nJoel Agree\n\nThanks, Smedes.\n\nOperator\n\nJosh Dennerlein, Bank of America\n\nFarrell Granath\n\nHi, this is Farrell Granath on behalf of Josh. I just wanted to ask specifically about the competition in the market now with the also increased acquisition and what you're seeing?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nNo, real material changes in competition in the market. The 1031 buyers are generally sidelined. The levered individual purchasers are generally sidelined. We've seen the CMBS market come back to a degree with lower LTVs. Institutional competition in our space remains extremely muted given the price point nature of our transactions. We're really focused on those $4 million to $5 million transaction, close relationship transactions where we can create value. And so competition is extremely limited.\n\nFarrell Granath\n\nGreat. And also just going back to the watch list, I was curious if there are any names that recently have been added or fallen off, anything that you're keeping?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nNothing material that I can think of. It's been a fairly consistent watch list. Obviously, the [cons] was in the news yesterday. We don't have any cons and there have been new cons, maybe they insured themselves, but we don't have -- these restaurant tenants that we see with the challenges in the news as well. So it's really it's been a consistent watch list, which we're on top of here. And the asset management team is on top of in case we get these spaces back. And frankly, we're excited to get some of these spaces back to really redo the Memphis, Tennessee former Bed Bath & Beyond, which I discussed in the prepared remarks.\n\nFarrell Granath\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nJoel Agree\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nMitch Germain, Citizens JMP.\n\nMitchell Germain\n\nThanks for taking my question. Joey, I'm curious when you look at like CVS versus Walgreens and you're making a bet on one and obviously trimming exposure to the other. What are the nuances of one store versus the other that gives you confidence in that model and that brand?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nGreat question. We've talked extensively over the years and there's a slide in the deck about our frankly, our dissatisfaction with Walgreens business model in performance. What we're looking for in a 21st century. suburban pharmacy is a one of three things, a high performing store that's generally doing over $12 million, $13 million with limited competition. A ground lease for a basis that makes sense in the 21st century omnichannel world.\r\nI'm hesitant to compare, but I'll compare suburban pharmacies today to movie theaters. Movie theaters are going away and neither are suburban pharmacies, they're just both going to be rationalized. And so we're very focused on the real estate fundamentals, the residual values and the individual store performance, you will not see us make any incremental investments in Walgreens. Obviously, we've gone from over 40% in 2010 to negligible today for a reason.\r\nThe only pharmacy we're interested in is CBS does. I think CBS exposure is most likely peaked here, but we're looking for unique transactions that are prototypical suburban pharmacy, Catty Corner or Kitty corner Walgreens paying $375,000 a year and $28 per square foot and a 14,000 square foot box that is infungible.\n\nMitchell Germain\n\nGreat. Thanks for that. And obviously, appreciate the white paper last week that you wrote. And I'm curious about C-stores, they're becoming obviously a greater emphasis of the portfolio. Is there -- obviously, it seems to be there's still a lot of competition for those types of assets. So is it kind of through developer relationships, corporate -- how are you getting success in growing that business.\n\nJoel Agree\n\nAll three platforms. We are very active on the development front specifically with the C-stores, large format C stores as well as the developer funding platform. Third, I would tell you acquisitions just due to the cap rates. The interesting thing about the C-store white paper is people's perception of an understanding of the large format C-store space is generally based on where they're located regionally.\r\nAnd I'll tell you here in Michigan, which sheets just entering come and go with now Maverick with an entry into the space, Kwik Trip entering Michigan. We're not familiar with the C-store, the Michigan consumer is not familiar with the large format C store that sells food and beverage for off-premises consumption, primarily coffee breakfast and lunch here.\r\nAnd so as C-stores, these regional operators, Wawa, sheetz quik trip, we go through a number of them expand across the country, what they're learning and what consumers are becoming accustomed to, is the C-store becoming a quick service restaurant. The C-store becoming a place to grab something quickly front end, which they historically grab in the pharmacy, a bag of chips of soda, any of those things.\r\nAnd so it's very interesting to watch them continue to grow. I think Wawa alone is launched -- announced seven new states and then watch the regionalized operators expand across the country and consumers flock to it. We saw it in Florida with Wawa. Now they have the history of racetrack in Florida. So a large format operator, I'd tell you, from my perspective, inferior food and beverage, but Wawa's success in Florida and other states has really led the way in. We were initial developer for Wawa on this data for other entry has led the way, given these C-stores confidence that consumers outside of their core region are going to continue on to really be attraction to the brand.\n\nMitchell Germain\n\nThank you. Congrats on the quarter.\n\nJoel Agree\n\nThank you, very much.\n\nOperator\n\nEric Borden, BMO Capital Markets.\n\nEric Borden\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just building off the comment on the white paper, just given that C-stores are growing presence and you highlighted how they're potentially taking share from QSRs and coffee shops. How high are you willing to take your exposure to C-stores? Could they be eventually become a top one or two sector for you and does this change your view on your current exposure to your QSR portfolio?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nI believe correct me if I'm wrong, Peter. C-stores are number four or approximately 8% of the overall portfolio. We don't have a C store tenant in our top 15, I believe Wawa's our largest just under 15 at approximately 1.7%, 1.8% I believe -- sorry, [711] we have in there above them to about 2.4%. There is lots of room for us to continue to add C-store. I mean, just taking them from, let's call it, the 8% to 10% of our overall portfolio from a sector perspective would be a very significant jump in the underlying portfolio and denominator continues to grow.\r\nSo we will aggressively continue to pursue those transactions. Many of them are on ground leases. We have very strong relationships and are growing additional relationships in that space. And I think C-stores are going to be amongst them and off-price the highest growth sectors overall in retail for probably the next 5 to 10 years.\r\nIn terms of QSR, it's very negligible in our portfolio. We quickly divested of the Burger Kings and the other things in the 1031 markets from private equity entered and purchasers were paying five caps for them. I think we have Peter, our QSR exposure is what?\n\nPeter Coughenour\n\nIt's roughly 1% and similar to our C-store exposure. And if we are acquiring or if we own a quick service restaurant or any type of restaurant we're looking to do so on a ground lease basis.\n\nJoel Agree\n\nAnd I think that and I believe took place number one or number two, and those are all ground leases in terms of QSRs, but we have stayed away from the Popeyes and Burger King franchisees and the Wendy's franchisees and all the Yum brand franchisees. One we don't like the real estate, the buildings are disposable, Inspector Gadget style, if you recall.\r\nAnd then two private equity came into the space, levered up balance sheets to drive cost down because they're unable to raise prices fast enough to drive EBITDA and the rent coverage post sale leaseback and divesting of the real estate. So we don't like food here in terms of selling it, we like to eat it. Food is an ancillary products like in the QSR space for convenience, we're big fans of, but you will not see us make any significant investments in the restaurant space absent ground lease.\n\nEric Borden\n\nThat's helpful. And you touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks. You know, as it relates to the '24 and 2025 lease expirations. How are your conversations with tenants for the '25? Are there tenants looking to renew early just given the land limited availability for retail real estate. And the second part of my question is, are there potential move-outs that we should have on our radar?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nGenerally, tenants don't renew early unless you give them something in exchange, we're confident of the those, I think it's 64 lease expirations. the vast majority will be exercising options. Those notifications, frankly, start in the fourth quarter of this year. If not the end of the third quarter of this year, there's generally a minimum of a 90 day lease notification or option notification that's required and so we'll be patient.\r\nAt the same time, if we see any vulnerabilities from either the store level data that we receive, the store level conversations, corporate conversations or market dynamics, we will definitely be in front of it and the asset management team led by our COO, Nicole Witteveen is on top of it. And no material move out that you should be aware of that are on our radar as of today.\n\nEric Borden\n\nAppreciate it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nBrad Heffern, RBC Capital Markets.\n\nBrad Heffern\n\nThanks. Morning, everyone. You have this disciplined capital allocator slide in the deck, slide 12, I think your own WACC calculation and the cap rates from the second quarter would put you in the pedal to the metal category. Would you say that's what you were thinking pedal to the metal for the fourth quarter and for 2025, assuming nothing changes? Or is there something that would moderate that view.\n\nJoel Agree\n\nGreat question, Brad. If you look at our spot cost of capital, it's down approximately 50 basis points in the last fair to say, 90 days Peter, 80 days. I do mention that the $700 million in guidance in the prepared remarks could prove conservative.\r\nWe have full optionality given our balance sheet and our cost of capital, to one either maintain the 150 basis point spread, we'll call it, mid seven's cash or to put the pedal to the metal and keep it to the 100 basis point spread, which is the lighter green.\r\nNow, we'll look at that on a case-by-case basis on a qualitative basis. We'll also look at larger transactions if those make sense in context of our portfolio. I think the interesting thing here is for fourth-quarter, we maintain full optionality. And as I mentioned earlier, sourcing started yesterday, given our clock in ARC.\r\nSo we have about nine ARC tells us. We have 92 days left to source for 2024. We are excited about those 92 days. What it brings our cost of capital and balance sheet affords us full flexibility now. And we're going to see how that materializes. So I think next quarter we'll have much more visibility into it. And again, the $700 million could prove conservative or we could push for that 150 basis point spread and say we're going to maintain discipline. That's going can be subject to the transactions that we're able to dig up.\n\nAlec Feygin\n\nOkay, got it. And then do you think cap rates will react to kind of the broader change in cost of capital for the public names and will they be as slow to go down as they were to go up?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nI tried to avoid predicting cap rates always on these calls and in any forum. Predictions always seem to be wrong. If I had my money, -- , put my money on it, they peaked. That said, just given the craziness of the world that we live in today. We're not going to place it either way, and we're going to -- a bet either way maintain our discipline here.\r\nWith the volatility out there from a macro, from a geopolitical, from a domestic perspective something like I've never seen in my career, obviously. And so we're going to maintain our agility and flexibility here. I wouldn't anticipate cap rates materially moving up on, but I could be wrong.\n\nOperator\n\nRenato Loy Yang, Baird.\n\nAlec Feygin\n\nIt's Alec Feygin.\r\nThank you for taking my question. How much has the transactable TAM increased by your current cost of equity relative to the beginning of the year?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nThe beginning of the year, we were weighing out do nothing scenarios. So that was, -- look, it's been a dramatic shift here. Again, that ties into the hesitancy of guidance and acquisition guidance for the year. This has been somewhat of a roller coaster.\r\nFrankly, we were on a defensive mindset here. We executed on a number of internal initiatives to frankly prepare for a slowdown. We deployed the do-nothing scenario and articulated that to the Street, followed by our initial guidance or inaugural guidance, I should say, with the approximately $600 million.\r\nSince then, as we've talked about on prior questions here, our cost of capital has decreased almost 10% materially here. And so it's been a roller coaster of the year. I'm extremely proud of the team, the discipline they've maintained. It is never easy for a team or a company to go through these types of strategic changes in these types of market base changes, but we buckled down, we maintained their discipline, we ramped up our efforts and now I anticipate we see the fruits of that labor.\n\nReuben Treatman\n\nGot it. Thank you. Second one for me. I also enjoyed reading your most recent white paper, things like a few of the questions have been asked already, but if you can just kind of tell us what percentage of your current C-store exposure is large format versus smaller regular format?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nIt's all large format. We don't believe in small format C-stores and maybe one or two odd ones that we have for some reason, we don't believe in the small format C-store. Again, just harkening back to my comment about the state of Michigan. Historically, gas stations, we didn't call them C-stores, had an auto base sold cigarette, gum and a cooler. We weren't familiar with that.\r\nNow some local operators and 7,11 expanded to offer food and beverage. We don't believe in the large, the small-format C-stores that as the white paper articulates the margin is not in fuel. The margin is in food and beverage, liquid gold is coffee, sitting in front of me right now. That is where C-stores drive margin and EBITDA. And so we do not invest in small-format C-stores, absent a ground lease or some unique circumstance.\n\nOperator\n\nUpal Rana, KeyBanc Capital Markets.\n\nUpal Rana\n\nThank you. Joey, with the possibility of a September rate cut being high at this point, how would that maybe impact your strategy leading up to that cut or even after assuming we get one?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nLook, I think a rate cut, a short term rate cut is most likely already priced into the market today. I mean, we are approaching August year now. So I would anticipate that's already approaching. You can see it priced in at the 90%-plus probability today. So I would tell you that it's no impact on our overall strategy here.\n\nUpal Rana\n\nOkay. And then just as a follow-up, what's your opinion on the current state of retailers broadly? We continue to hear some more of these companies either filing, restructuring, closing stores. I just want to get your view on the current state of the market and maybe what you may be hearing. And obviously, you don't own a lot of these names, but just want to get your true sense?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nWe are back to capitalism in retail or Darwinism in retail. The strong will survive. The large players, which were focused on our sandbox with the balance sheet to invest in labor, in price and in fulfillment strategies. We're in the fifth inning, sixth inning max over that transition to an omnichannel world. The legacy retailers that were frankly bolstered by COVID by the access to cheap capital or IPOs, we're going to see them continue to fade and go away.\r\nThis is something that we fully anticipated. It's back to a normal cycle and normal business cycle, and that was, frankly, averted in during COVID and in a post-COVID world where money was free. And so now we are, it's about balance sheet, it's about execution. It's about value propositions for consumers. And that's irrespective of where the macroeconomic or consumer health lies.\r\nIn dollar, general, we talked about how they've had a more difficult time because the $50,000 median household income is obviously challenged. Dollar general is going to be just fine here, guys. They're a provider of food for rural America today that probably be would be a national security threat if they went out of business.\r\nAnd at the same time, they have a huge balance sheet. They have a growing demand on an overall basis, inclusive of their new store count for their goods, primarily now servicing, food and essentials, all of them. And so we're going to go back to a world where in the world, again, I had a conversation yesterday with the turnaround consultant who is very busy working with retailers. We're back in the world where the strong survive and the weak will die off. And that's a good thing. That's capitalism.\n\nOperator\n\nMichael Goldsmith, UBS.\n\nMichael Goldsmith\n\nGood morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. We appreciate the guidance and increased visibility into the algorithm. Now, I think as the investment community tries to digest your approach to the outlook. You've talked about the acquisition guidance of $700 million being conservative. You may have mentioned that like at least three times on the call.\r\nAnd you took it up in this quarter. So just trying to get a sense of how are you looking at setting that guidance? For instance like does reflect your visibility into the third quarter and then a haircut of what you think is reasonable for fourth quarter? Just trying to get some better understanding of like the mindset -- when opening that number on the piece of paper..\n\nJoel Agree\n\nYeah. Look, it reflects the current visibility we have and that gives us flexibility to deploy capital subject to our cost of capital. I mean this is all packaged together. So, if you will, from 30,000 feet, we're assuming treasury method of dilution in our guidance as Peter articulated.\r\nAt the same time, we're not incorporating any assumptions that are non-static base. When I talk about it being potentially conservative, I'm just not willing to go out there on a limb given the volatility we've had with the presidential candidate being attempted assassination, another one dropping out of the race, the volatility we have in this world to go out on a limb and tell everyone we're going to do some wild number in the fourth quarter of this year when acquisition sourcing for fourth quarter started yesterday.\r\nWe have $1.2 million in our fourth quarter pipeline for acquisitions. That is our normal cycle. We don't want any more in that because we don't want to be on a forward basis. And so we just don't have visibility. This is a conservative company all around whether it's our guidance, our balance sheet, our management philosophy and then how we message to the Street. And so we're going to stick to that philosophy through and through.\r\nNow again, I hope fourth quarter proves much more, much larger. I'll call it than our conservative underlying assumptions here. But again, if we maintain the willingness to stick to now 150 basis point spread and be strategic and surgical about the acquisition pipeline. And what we execute on or step on the gas have qualitatively transactions warranted.\n\nReuben Treatman\n\nThank you very much for that. I think we can all appreciate that. And my second question is related to the dispositions during the quarter. It included Mister Car Wash and Gerber similar to last quarter. What are the characteristics of the properties you're looking to recycle? And should we read anything into the cap rates on the dispositions moving up 20 basis points sequentially?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nNo, I appreciate the question. This was part of our disposition program and capital recycling of non-core assets at a very aggressive basis. So as you can see in the mid sixes here, these were Garber collisions and basically Florida-based stuff with Florida-based money that is overheated. And so this was the first half of the year. Capital recycling program that is now most likely transition to given our cost of capital here.\r\nOur goal was to dispose of assets that were non-core and recycle that north of 100 basis points wide. Obviously, that has changed. We were prepared not to enter any the equity markets and the do-nothing scenario. And we bolstered our asset management disposition capabilities. We've now executed on, I believe $60 million of those of that type of asset recycling. Not that anything is not for sale here. All real estate is for sale at the right price. But at the same time here, we are focused on offset that.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions)\r\nJohn Kilichowski, Wells Fargo\n\nJohn Kilichowski\n\nThank you. So early on the call you mentioned that distress is picking up in the market as it relates to acquisition opportunities. Are these idiosyncratic? Or are they specific to certain geographies or asset types?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nI don't recall saying distress is picking up in the market. I mean, we think distress is pretty static throughout the market based upon what we call the 3Ds, death, divorce and debt, whether it's asset-specific debt or just overall capital structure of an entity or an institution or individual.\r\nAnd so I think there's a level of distress in the market refinancing obviously is down, LTVs are down, proceeds are down. Local and regional banks are challenged here, developers are challenged. There's a level of distress that we continue to work through. Take advantage of across all three platforms. But I wouldn't say we've had I've seen a notable increase in distress throughout the course of the year.\n\nJohn Kilichowski\n\nOkay, understood. Maybe I was just the mention of distress. So second question here. Have you noticed a material change in seller behavior following either the most recent CPI print or how sentiment has changed around the election?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nSentiment change on the election, that's hot off the press, I can't tell you anything on that front. In terms of the most recent CPI print. This is such a large and fragmented space. I think sellers today if they're waiting for one cut or two cut from the Fed and correlated to the 10-year treasury and cap rates, thereafter, looking at tertiary effects.\r\nSo I tell you, look, I think sellers have come to the realization now with the stabilizer or semi stabilized treasury in the4.2 to 4.3 band here that we're in a higher for longer period. Reality is amongst those guys. And so what we tell our team members is that as our working assumption. If a seller does not have that or potential seller does not have that working assumption move on to the next one.\n\nOperator\n\nLinda Tsai, Jefferies.\n\nLinda Tsai\n\nHi. Just a follow-up on a C-stores in your white paper. You highlighted several WAWA, Sheetz, QuikTrip, 7-Eleven. What does term look like for these deals? And what do cap rates look like across these different concepts? And then I guess last question is like, who would you consider your main competition in competing for these names?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nSo term is generally 15 to 20 years. Many of them are on ground lease structures that's WAWA preferred format is a ground lease structure. You can see that reflective in our investor deck with just our WAWA exposure there. Sheetz is very similar generally on ground lease structures, 7-Eleven generally on a turnkey basis.\r\nCap rates vary. There's a lot of regional purchasers for these operators. By the way, I should apologize to all the Bucky's fan that we didn't include them in the white paper because I got lots of e-mails, but where is Bucky's,--, amazing operation, if you're not familiar, but only about 100 stores.\r\nWe didn't want to make in the white encyclopedia. It's a white paper, so we include everybody. So I apologize for those Bucky's fans. We'd love to do business with Bucky's. Cap rate range. You get a lot of local buyers have fallen in love with the WAWA down the street or the sheet to the quick trip down the street from them.\r\nAnd so cap rates range, we're not into we still see trades in the fives. We don't pay attention to that stuff. Again, I'd remind everyone Linda that we're working across all three external platforms here, growth platforms, to C-store opportunity. So for us to buy a full term, new WAWA, Sheetz or QuikTrip would be very rare.\n\nReuben Treatman\n\nAnd then just a quick question on drugstores with Rite Aid and Walgreens closing stores, and I know you were very aggressive in reducing your Walgreens exposure in recent years. But do you have thoughts on where this market share gets reallocated?\n\nJoel Agree\n\nA great question. The work gets reallocated. The front end of the stores have been reallocated to C-stores the front end the pharmacies, chips, drinks, right? Those have candy reallocated to C-stores. The fragrance beauty has been reallocated to the Alphas the Sephoras plus online of the world. While simultaneously that share has exited the first floor of the department stores as we see shrinkage there.\r\nPharmacy, generally, I'll tell you has stayed somewhat fairly stable, but the problem is the generic pressure on drugs as well as the third party government reimbursement rates for there. We haven't seen an online penetration of pharmacy that is material now, Costco, Walmart, all of those operators also grocery stores operate pharmacy.\r\nBut the business has never driven EBITDA from the pharmacy. The business is driven from the 11,000 square feet at the front end space and that front end is under pressure. As I mentioned, I think on the last call, I go to the pharmacy asset picking up a script three times a year.\r\nThe Valentine's Day, my wife's birthday and my anniversary and I stand there and get a $9 greeting card and I can't believe it's $9. If you're going to run in for any convenience items, you're going to a convenience store, it's faster. They have more checkout lanes and it's cheaper.\r\nWhen I need new toothpaste ahead order again on Amazon. It shows up cheaper the next day for free. So you see the disintermediation across the aisles. As you walk around the pharmacy. It is not going to one specific competitor. It's being disintermediated by multiple different retail sectors plus Amazon. And so there is no turning back from this, but there is no merchandising strategy that takes the pharmacy front end and makes it successful that would not be a wholesale change.\r\nPharmacies, inclusive of Walgreens, have -- explored and experimented with things like the Walgreens caf\u00e9. The challenge there is to manage food and beverage or off-premises consumption if you have soda fountains and slurpee machines, you have coffee stations, they break. People have spills and their challenges to manage.\r\nAnd when you have three FTE's Max, exclusive of the pharmacy, three full-time employees checking out stocking and a manager you can that service and maintain that type of equipment. So that hasn't worked. Walgreens also experimented or Walgreens Boots Alliance with cosmetics and fragrance thinking that they could replicate Boots Alliance experience in Western Europe.\r\nThe underestimated the American consumer women in this country don't go to the traditional pharmacy for beauty, makeup, fragrance. ALTA has taken that share from the department stores very dissimilar from Western Europe.\r\nSo next time you walk around a pharmacy just look around the aisles and say, where can I buy this stuff. The stuff in the middle that seasonal go to Five Below, it's cheaper. Go to the dollar store. It's cheaper right? The Halloween junk, the Christmas stuff that stuff has a better assortment. It's better organized probably and it's cheaper at the Dollar Store. You walk around the perimeter, think of a C-store. So that's kind of what we do here and how we figure out what sectors and retailers we think makes sense in 2024 and beyond.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. So there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ruben for closing comments.\n\nReuben Treatman\n\nAll right. Thank you very much. Great job, Susan. I hope everybody enjoys the rest of the summer. We look forward to seeing you soon. Thank you.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Everyone\u2019s definition of \u201cconsumer stocks\u201d is different.\n\nStrictly speaking, I would say that companies operating in the consumer discretionary sector are the best examples of consumer stocks. However, others in the industry might suggest that consumer staples companies are also to be included in the larger group of constituents that are consumer stocks.\n\nWhen selecting consumer stocks to buy and sell, using the holdings of popular ETFs is a good way to develop investable ideas. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLY) and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP) are two appropriate examples.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThey represent the consumer discretionary and consumer staples stocks within the S&P 500. XLY has 52 holdings while XLP has 38. I\u2019ve selected at least one name from each sector. While they\u2019re both up more than 7% in 2024, they are trailing the index badly in 2024.\n\nWord to the wise. If you\u2019re smart, you\u2019ll get your money out of these three stocks before the end of 2024.\n\nTyson Foods (TSN) Tyson (TSN Stock) chicken in a package.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nTyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) share price is up nearly 7% year-to-date, less than half the return of the index. Given the actions of its suspended CFO John Tyson, I\u2019m amazed it\u2019s in positive territory at all.\n\nOn June 13, Tyson was arrested by the University of Arkansas police and charged with driving while intoxicated and careless driving after an officer witnessed the Tyson heir drive up on a curb. Tyson said he wasn\u2019t drinking but ultimately said he had consumed up to seven beers. Unsurprisingly, his blood alcohol level was twice the 0.08 legal limit in Arkansas.\n\nIn November 2022, Tyson was arrested after falling asleep in a woman\u2019s apartment in Fayetteville, Arkansas. He was charged with criminal trespassing and public intoxication.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine anyone keeping their job after two incidents of public intoxication but the CFO of a public company? That\u2019s a red flag for investors in my opinion. CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram seemed to agree.\u00a0Reuters reported in June:\n\n\u2018At some point, the board will need to decide when enough is enough,\u2019 said Arun Sundaram, analyst with CFRA Research. \u2018It\u2019s difficult to imagine many other high-ranking executives retaining their positions after several legal incidents.\u2019\n\nThere are good family-controlled businesses and there are bad ones. Tyson is a bad one.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nBy the time this is published, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) will have been removed from the Nasdaq 100 and replaced by Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), the manufacturer of high-performance servers, whose shares are up more than 175% in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis isn\u2019t a surprise move by the index, given WBA stock has lost 58% of its value in 2024. To remain in the index, you must have a market capitalization of at least 0.1% of the total of all 100 companies. Right now, that works out to about 0.05%.\n\nThat\u2019s the one shoe to drop. The other will be when it is escorted from the S&P 500. It hasn\u2019t happened yet, but it will be soon enough.\n\nMeanwhile, CEO Tim Wentworth told analysts in its Q3 2024 conference call that the drug store chain would close many of its stores as part of the company\u2019s turnaround plan.\n\nWhile store closures are a natural move to lower its operating costs, it might be enough to deliver profits for shareholders. It lost $13.1 billion through the third quarter.\n\nWentworth\u2019s turnaround will take several quarters, if not years, to be successful.\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) is up over 2% YTD. That\u2019s not great but compared to other publicly traded pizza chains \u2014 Papa John\u2019s (NASDAQ:PZZA) has lost 46% YTD \u2014 it\u2019s hanging in there.\n\nSince former CEO Patrick Doyle announced he was stepping down in January 2018, DPZ stock has more than doubled (124%) in value. This proves that the CEOs who followed Doyle didn\u2019t do a terrible job in the 6.5 years since Doyle\u2019s announced departure.\n\nHowever, in the eight years and three months Doyle was CEO, its shares appreciated by 2,159%, 17x the performance since.\n\nThey say you can\u2019t go back. Domino\u2019s has to push forward with the best plan possible to drive growth. Its plan included a significant international push. That appears to be in jeopardy.\n\nOn July 18, as part of its Q2 2024 results, it indicated that its goal to open 925 stores internationally would fall 225 (24%) short of that in 2024. One of its master franchisees, Domino\u2019s Pizza Enterprises (DPE) had troubles opening and closing stores during the quarter.\n\nDuring the conference call, its executives were asked if DPE was an isolated incident or if analysts could expect other international master franchisees to deliver fewer stores than planned over the second half of 2024. They didn\u2019t really answer the question.\n\nThat\u2019s a red flag.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Many investors flock to high-yield dividend stocks because they offer a simple premise. You can put your money into a stock and generate high cash flow that gets treated more favorably when it\u2019s time to file taxes. Some high-yield stocks have higher rates than high-yield savings accounts, but high-yield doesn\u2019t mean that a stock presents a buying opportunity.\n\nSome stocks with high yields have substantially underperformed the stock market. While the dividend payouts may continue to arrive, investors end up with a net loss if you consider depreciation.\n\nCorporations with high dividend yields tend to have lower revenue and net income growth. Some of these same companies have flat or declining year-over-year growth rates. In any event, you don\u2019t want those types of corporations in your portfolio. While some high-yield stocks benefit from short-term momentum, the stock market is a weighing machine in the long run. These are some of the high-yield stocks to sell that can hurt shareholder value in the long run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVerizon (VZ) Verizon Retail Location.

VZ stock\n\nSource: RAMAN SHAUNIA / Shutterstock.com\n\nVerizon (NYSE:VZ) has enjoyed a surprising 22% rally over the past year, but that\u2019s not likely to last. Shares are down by 27% over the past five years, and financial growth rates don\u2019t suggest that the stock will generate solid gains for long-term investors. Operating revenue only increased by 0.2% YOY in the first quarter, while EPS dropped from $1.17 to $1.09.\n\nThe company\u2019s fastest growing segment is Verizon Consumer revenue, which only increased by 0.8% YOY. Meanwhile, Verizon Business revenue dropped by 1.6% YOY. Verizon has been a value stock for many years. Investors don\u2019t expect Verizon to report consistent double-digit revenue and net income growth. However, the rally has made Verizon stock overstretch at current levels.\n\nThose growth rates raise concern about a 15.5 P/E ratio. The stock offers a generous 6.39% yield, but that payout doesn\u2019t make up for Verizon\u2019s consistent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) An image of a large brick wall painting of the top of a glass with a white \"Coca-Cola\" logo on it filled with soda and ice with soda splasing from the top of it on a red background.\n\nSource: Luciano Mortula - LGM / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has been praised as a blue-chip stock for many years. It\u2019s still a top holding in Warren Buffett\u2019s portfolio which some investors use to gauge their decisions. It\u2019s undoubtable that Coca-Cola has become a household name and will continue to make billions of dollars every quarter.\n\nHowever, the corporation\u2019s growth rates and a 26 P/E ratio suggest that this stock may be due for a correction. Shares are up by 9% year-to-date, but they have only gained 21% over the past five years, trailing the S&P 500 in both regards. The stock offers a 2.97% yield, but growth hasn\u2019t been as impressive.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenue only increased by 3% YOY to reach $11.3 billion. Yes, that\u2019s a lot of revenue, but growth rates matter more for a stock\u2019s long-term gains. EPS also inched up by 3% YOY. These growth rates haven\u2019t kept up with YTD stock gains. Given Coca-Cola\u2019s low growth rates, it looks overvalued at current levels.\n\nWalgreens (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens (NYSE:WBA) has a 9% yield, but that\u2019s not going to last forever. There\u2019s speculation that Walgreens may have to suspend its dividend entirely as the company endures numerous woes. The pharmacy retailer has already received the boot from the Dow Jones and will soon be removed from the Nasdaq-100. The stock\u2019s 59% YTD drop has scared away many investors.\n\nWhile a 9% yield and a 91-year history of consecutive dividend payments look tempting, investors should not consider it when taking a look at Walgreens\u2019 current state. Walgreens only reported a 2.6% YOY increase in Q3 FY24 net sales and reduced its fiscal 2024 adjusted EPS guidance from $2.95 to $2.80.\n\nThe company is also poised to close many of its U.S. stores, especially ones in unprofitable locations. This decision reflects the challenges Walgreens faces and will result in lost market share. Roughly 25% of Walgreens stores are unprofitable. Leadership cited inflation and theft as factors that have hurt sales and profits.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Selling stocks just because of the negative momentum riding behind them is not typically a good idea. However, for the firms that have lost their way, with questionable (and perhaps deteriorating) long-term growth narratives, decaying fundamentals, or other uncertainties that could weigh heavily on one\u2019s longer-term (think three to five years or more) investment thesis, it may be better to cut one\u2019s losses. These stocks to sell are falling knives that you need to avoid before getting stuck.\n\nIndeed, a troubled stock can keep on tumbling for quite some time. This is especially true for those that didn\u2019t sport a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple. It is also true for any other valuation metric, for that matter to begin with.\n\nManagement reshuffling and other potential \u201cred flags\u201d may also be contributors to why one would part ways with a stock. In this piece, we\u2019ll look at three falling knife stocks that may be worth dumping. Afterall, the long-term story seems just a bit too hazy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLululemon (LULU) A close-up picture of the Lululemon (LULU) sign in the Hong Kong airport.\n\nSource: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com\n\nLululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) was the hot apparel play as athleisure and comfort (over style) trended in 2021 and 2023. Nowadays, it seems somewhat less appropriate to look like you just came from the gym in most settings that do not entail athletics. That\u2019s had a devastating impact on LULU stock. The stock finds itself down almost 45% from its all-time high of $511.\n\nThough shares appear like they\u2019re on the discount rack at 19.7 times forward P/E. I fail to see any significant drivers that could reverse recent damage to the stock.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s not just about athleisure versus other trends that have me worried. I am also worried about the company\u2019s ability to keep charging high prices in an athletic apparel market. This is because it is saturated with competitors. If Lululemon can\u2019t gain traction at the Paris 2024 Olympics (it\u2019s dressing the Canadian Olympians again), perhaps the nearly 50% haircut may be the start of Lulu\u2019s pains.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NYSE:WBA) stock just can\u2019t seem to catch a break, with shares recently getting the boot from the Nasdaq 100 for Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). Indeed, getting kicked out of a major exchange for the lack of performance is not a good sign.\n\nAt writing, WBA stock has now shed more than 86% of its value from peak levels. It\u2019s sitting at 27-year lows. There may be some deep value. However, the company has some serious issues it needs to address to win back the confidence of investors and Wall Street analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) recently slashing its WBA stock price target by $10 to $20 per share over \u201cchallenging\u201d recent results, it\u2019s tough to find much to get behind the name right here as it closes 300 stores in just a couple of months. You can see how this made our list of stocks to sell.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is hardly a falling knife compared to Walgreens Boots Alliance. That said, CMG stock has been reversing in a hurry in recent weeks, now down close to 22% from its short-lived June peak. Though I see nothing alarming to rush to the exits over, I do find the valuation to still be rich.\n\nAt writing, CMG shares trade at 56.9 times trailing P/E. That\u2019s a huge premium to the quick-serve restaurant industry. It is also one that may not be worth paying even if the company is primed to keep firing on all cylinders. While the company\u2019s long-term growth narrative remains outstanding, I see no reason to pay a premium multiple for it, especially now that momentum has turned so violently.\n\nIn short, Chipotle\u2019s a great company, but one that could afford to take an even steeper plunge as investors rotate to value and slightly away from top-tier growth as CMG stock\u2019s massive 50-for-1 split comes into effect. Do yourself a favor and dump all of these stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This study aims to enhance U.S. public health preparedness through Walgreens community pharmacy network, improving access and diversity in clinical trials via a $25m award\n\nDEERFIELD, Ill., July 23, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Walgreens today announced it received a project award valued up to $25 million through the Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle (RRPV) to conduct a Phase IV observational clinical study focused on assessing Correlates of Protection (CoP), known as responses to a vaccine that predict how well a vaccinated person will be protected from future infections, using COVID-19 vaccine data. The RRPV is a Consortium funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This partnership underscores a shared commitment to advancing public health through innovative research and leveraging Walgreens\u2019 extensive community pharmacies to increase access and representation in clinical trials.\n\nAs a leading community pharmacy and front door to the U.S. healthcare system, Walgreens played a pivotal role in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and testing throughout the pandemic. Walgreens has administered over 90 million COVID-19 vaccinations to date, showcasing its capacity to handle large-scale health initiatives. Building on this experience, through this collaboration, the BARDA-funded study will utilize select Walgreens community pharmacies as clinical trial sites to assess the effectiveness of FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines. This initiative aims to enhance access to clinical research across diverse patient populations, particularly in communities historically underrepresented in clinical trials.\n\n\"We are honored to be selected by BARDA and its RRPV for this important study as this is a step forward to utilize public and private partnerships to bring clinical trials into more communities across the country,\" said Ramita Tandon, chief clinical trials officer at Walgreens. \"With our experience in immunizations and trusted relationship with millions of patients and customers, Walgreens is uniquely positioned to support this critical research. As the only retail pharmacy with a national decentralized clinical trial infrastructure and dedicated clinical research staff, we are committed to helping enhance public health preparedness.\"\n\nWalgreens will employ a comprehensive approach to participant recruitment, which will leverage its physical footprint in addition to its compliant and secure decentralized clinical trial platform to reach patients where it\u2019s most convenient for them. The study will enroll up to 4,000 participants across 20 retail pharmacy locations nationwide, ensuring a diverse and representative study population.\n\nStory continues\n\nFunding for this award was received under Project NextGen, a $5 billion initiative by HHS to advance a pipeline of new, innovative vaccines and therapeutics providing broader and more durable protection for COVID-19 than the first-generation COVID vaccines and medicines. BARDA is supporting the development of new vaccines, therapeutics, and enabling technologies to better address the waning immunity and resistance to current and future SARS-CoV2 viral strains.\n\nThis project is being funded with federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR); Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under Other Transaction (OT) number: 75A50123D00005.\n\nAbout Walgreens:\n\nWalgreens (http://www.walgreens.com) is included in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and U.S. Healthcare segments of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (Nasdaq: WBA), an integrated healthcare, pharmacy and retail leader. True to its purpose of \"more joyful lives through better health,\" Walgreens has a more than 120-year heritage of caring for communities and providing trusted pharmacy services, and today is playing a greater role as an independent partner of choice offering healthcare services that improve care, lower costs, and help patients.

        "title": "2 Beaten-Down Dividend Stocks With Ultra-High Yields Above 9%: Are They Bargains Now?",
        "content": "The benchmark S&P 500 index is up about 16% this year, but that doesn't mean all stocks are rising. Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA) and Medical Properties Trust(NYSE: MPW) are down by more than half over the past 12 months.\n\nAfter falling a long way, Walgreens offers an eye-popping yield above 9% at recent prices. The yield you could receive from Medical Properties Trust is even higher.\n\nOn the one hand, these stocks could deliver huge gains for patient investors by simply maintaining their ultra-high-yield payouts. On the other hand, unfortunately, their prices wouldn't be under so much pressure if investors felt confident about their profitability.\n\nHere's a closer look to see if these beaten-down dividend payers could be underappreciated bargains.\n\n1. Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nShares of Walgreens Boots Alliance last reached an all-time high in 2015, and the stock is down about 89% from its peak. The company had a streak of 47 consecutive years with annual dividend raises until this January, when it slashed the quarterly payment nearly in half to $0.25 per share.\n\nInvestors who worried that one dividend cut wouldn't be enough hammered the stock price so low that it offers a 9.3% yield at recent prices.\n\nWalgreens still operates the largest chain of retail pharmacies, with about 8,700 in the U.S. and thousands more abroad. Its enormous size is an advantage for the pharmacy chain when it comes to sourcing prescription drugs and consumer goods. Unfortunately, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) that dictate how much reimbursement pharmacies receive when they fill prescriptions are eroding this advantage.\n\nThe three largest PBMs are also owned by insurers: CVS Health, UnitedHealth Group, and Cigna. None of these businesses are obligated to ensure Walgreens can turn a profit when it fills prescriptions. Moreover, all three also manage their own mail-order pharmacies, so there's a strong financial incentive to turn patients away from Walgreens and other retail outlets.\n\nWhen the company reported fiscal third-quarter results in June, it had to lower earnings guidance for the year to reflect what it called \"pharmacy industry trends\" caused by PBMs. The stock's recent price is less than four times management's adjusted earnings estimate for the fiscal year that ends in August.\n\nOn the one hand, Walgreens stock could produce huge gains if earnings stop falling. Then again, the stranglehold the consolidated PBM industry has on retail pharmacies isn't likely to subside anytime soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is preparing to sue CVS Health, UnitedHealth Group, and Cigna over their drug pricing practices, but success doesn't seem likely. It's probably best to avoid investing in independent pharmacy chains like Walgreens unless the FTC's suit against the three big PBMs succeeds.\n\n2. Medical Properties Trust\n\nAs its name implies, Medical Properties Trust is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in medical properties. At the end of March, its portfolio contained 436 of them. Most are hospitals and acute-care clinics spread throughout the U.S. and abroad.\n\nMedical Properties' portfolio collects rent from 53 different operators. The REIT typically gets them to sign net leases that transfer all the variable costs associated with building ownership, such as taxes and maintenance, to the tenant.\n\nThis REIT's net-lease operation produces hyper-reliable cash flows as long as its tenants can pay their rent. The stock is more than 80% below the all-time high it set in 2022 because its most important tenant, Steward Health Care, is a hot mess. This July, the Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation of Steward a couple of months after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nAt the end of March, Steward held keys to 18.6% of Medical Property Trust's total assets, but the failing operator only contributed 3.9% of revenue. As a result, the REIT is selling properties that Steward doesn't rent to make ends meet.\n\nMedical Properties slashed its dividend by 48% last year. The stock price has fallen, too, and at recent prices, it offers an enormous 12.8% dividend yield.\n\nThis stock could produce market-beating gains if it simply maintains its dividend payout at present levels. With a shrinking portfolio of properties to collect rent from, though, another dividend cut seems more likely than a speedy recovery.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Realty Income Is Down So Far in 2024 -- But Here's Why I'm Buying Shares Now",
        "content": "Realty Income(NYSE: O) stock has fallen a bit in 2024, with shares down by 3% for the year as of this writing. Even including dividends, the total return of the real estate investment trust (REIT) is roughly flat.\n\nWhile there are some legitimate concerns about Realty Income, the business is doing quite well, and it is mostly factors such as interest rates that have put pressure on the stock. Here's a rundown of why Realty Income has underperformed the market and why it could be set for a turnaround.\n\nWhy has Realty Income underperformed?\n\nTo be sure, Realty Income isn't alone. REITs in general have been terrible underperformers in 2024. The Vanguard Real Estate ETF(NYSEMKT: VNQ) has produced a total return of just 1% for the year through July 15, which is 18 percentage points below that of the S&P 500. ^SPXTR Chart\n\nThe main reason for the poor performance is the rising-rate environment of the past couple of years and specifically the change in expectations for rate cuts compared to the start of 2024. The median-investor expectation was for six Federal Reserve rate cuts at the start of the year, but now the first one isn't expected to happen until September.\n\nWithout getting too deep into the weeds, rising interest rates are generally a negative catalyst for REITs. As risk-free interest rates (like those paid by Treasuries or your savings account) rise, investors tend to rotate money out of riskier income instruments like REITs. Plus, higher rates make it more difficult for REITs to borrow money to fund growth at attractive rates.\n\nSome legitimate concerns\n\nWhile interest rates have been the dominant force affecting most REITs over the past couple of years, it's important to note that Realty Income investors have a few legitimate concerns. Specifically, a few of Realty Income's tenants are facing challenging conditions.\n\nWalgreens (NASDAQ: WBA) is the biggest concern. The pharmacy chain's CEO recently said that about 25% of its stores aren't profitable and that the company's strategic review will \"include the closure of a significant portion of these underperforming stores.\" Dollar Tree(NASDAQ: DLTR) is also planning to close 600 of its Family Dollar stores in the United States this year.\n\nRealty Income could certainly feel a sting from these events, but it's important to keep things in perspective. For one thing, although they are among the REIT's top tenants, Walgreens and Dollar Tree account for 3.4% and 3.1% of Realty Income's total rental income. Plus, Realty Income's properties tend to be well-located and high-quality. It's tough to imagine a scenario where more than 1% or 2% of Realty Income's total portfolio is affected by store closures in the next few years.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolid business results\n\nDespite the concerns and interest rate pressures, Realty Income's business continues to perform quite well. In the first quarter, adjusted funds from operations (AFFO -- the real estate equivalent to \"earnings\") per share grew by more than 5% year over year. The portfolio remained 98.6% occupied, and the company announced its 124th dividend increase since its 1994 NYSE listing.\n\nIt's also worth noting that because of its superior credit rating, Realty Income is still able to fund growth attractively. For example, it recently issued new debt at a 4.75% interest rate, and the average cash yield from the nearly $600 million worth of properties acquired in Q2 was 7.8%.\n\nThe bottom line is that while Realty Income is down by about 30% from its all-time high, much of this is due to temporary interest-rate headwinds. The actual issues affecting its portfolio are likely to be minor. With a 5.7% dividend yield, it could be a great time for investors of all kinds to take a closer look at this reliable income grower.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Realty Income wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Red Flags: 3 Stocks Drowning in Debt to Sell ASAP",
        "content": "Almost every company has some debt. Many large and very profitable companies obtained significant\u00a0amounts of\u00a0debt when interest rates were negligible from 2009 until 2021. By doing so, they were able to make effective acquisitions that boosted their bottom lines and increased their cash holdings\u00a0in order to finance share buybacks, dividend increases, and make themselves more financially secure.\n\nOf course, these firms will have no trouble paying back their debt, and their interest costs are relatively negligible. In such cases, debt is positive for companies and their shareholders. Conversely, some troubled firms that usually lose money have run up\u00a0extremely large\u00a0amounts of debt\u00a0in order to\u00a0stay in business.\u00a0Often, these firms are paying high interest rates,\u00a0and\u00a0they\u00a0may have trouble paying back their loans.\n\nAnd if they are ultimately unable to make the payments on their loans, they will probably declare bankruptcy, causing their stock to become worthless. Consequently, investors should avoid buying the shares of such companies. These three firms are in the latter category, making them three stocks to sell ASAP.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC (AMC) Mobile phone with logo of AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC). Pumping stock exchange prices by Reddit investors. Playing on market, manipulation. Losses, crisis.\n\nSource: Ira Lichi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMovie theater owner\u00a0AMC (NYSE:AMC) had nearly $9 billion in debt as of the end of the first quarter, along with only $624 million in cash. Moreover, its current ratio, which divides a company\u2019s current assets by its current liabilities, is 0.8. The fact that the firm\u2019s current ratio is meaningfully below one suggests\u00a0that it\u00a0may have difficulty making its debt payments over the next year.\n\nAnother factor that makes AMC one of the stocks to sell ASAP is\u00a0the fact\u00a0that its operations generally burn significant amounts of cash each quarter. For example, in Q1, its operations\u00a0burned $188.3 million of\u00a0cash, and in the previous quarter it lost $77.8 million\u00a0of cash\u00a0on its operations. As a result, it cannot fund the payments on its debt from profits from its business.\n\nOver $2.8 billion\u00a0of the company\u2019s debt will come due in 2026. Although AMC has held talks with its lenders about extending the due date on those loans, no deal on the matter has been reached yet, and the creditors may not have an incentive to extend the debt since AMC does not seem to be close to breaking into the black. As 2026 draws nearer, investors\u00a0are likely to\u00a0become more reluctant to buy AMC stock, causing the shares to tumble.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs of the end of Q1,\u00a0Walgreens (NYSE:WBA) owed a\u00a0huge\u00a0$33.66 billion in debt and had only $711 million of cash.\u00a0What\u2019s more, its total debt-to-equity ratio was\u00a0a very large\u00a0218%, while its current ratio was 0.65. As I noted previously, the current ratio divides a company\u2019s current assets by its current liabilities, and firms with current ratios below one could have difficulty meeting their financial obligations in the next year.\n\nIn Q1, Walgreens\u00a0did manage to generate $604 million of cash from its operations. However, in the previous two quarters, its operations lost $637 million and $281 million of cash. Consequently, the retailer will probably\u00a0not be able\u00a0to pay off its debt with cash generated from its operations.\n\nAlso boding\u00a0badly\u00a0for Walgreens\u2019 outlook,\u00a0Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) on June 28 slashed its price target on the shares to $11 from $22. The bank expects the company\u2019s profitability to\u00a0be hurt\u00a0by negative pharmacy reimbursement trends and weak sales of its general merchandise\u00a0going forward.\u00a0Bank of America cut its fiscal 2024 and\u00a0fiscal\u00a02025 earnings per share estimates for the retailer to $2.88 and $2.23, respectively, from $3.20\u00a0and\u00a0$3.30.\u00a0The bank kept an \u201cunderperform\u201d rating on the name.\n\nGiven Walgreens\u2019 huge debt and negative catalysts, it deserves to be on this list of three stocks to sell ASAP.\n\nBig Lots (BIG) Stock crash market exchange loss trading graph analysis investment indicator business graph charts of financial digital background down stock crisis red price in down trend chart fall. Why are stocks down today?\n\nSource: Bigc Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nBig Lots (NYSE:BIG) is\u00a0by far\u00a0the most troubled company in this column. Indeed, the discount retailer issued a going concern warning in June. Specifically, the firm warned that it may\u00a0not be able\u00a0to make its loan payments and stay in business over the long term. As a result, it\u2019s\u00a0clearly\u00a0one of the top three stocks to sell ASAP.\n\nAs of the end of Q1, the firm\u00a0had a total cash position of just $44 million and total debt of $2.38 billion. Moreover, Big Lots\u2019 total debt-to-equity ratio was a stratospheric 2,917%. The company\u2019s current ratio was 1.39, indicating\u00a0that it\u00a0may have enough assets to pay its debts over the next year. Still, the company will\u00a0clearly\u00a0be in trouble over the longer term.\n\nIndeed, in the 12 months that ended in March, the firm\u2019s operations burned $230 million of cash, so it will not be able to make its loan payments with cash from its operations.\n\nIn Q1, the company\u2019s\u00a0revenue sank 10% versus the same period a year earlier while it generated a loss per share of $4.51.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either\u00a0directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "7 Long-Term Tech Stocks for Extending Investment Horizons",
        "content": "Is the tech trade really over? Much is being written about investors rotating capital out of high-flying technology names and into value and small-cap stocks. While the rotation is seen as healthy and likely to prolong the current market rally that began in late 2022, it seems doubtful that technology stocks will trail for long.\n\nFirst of all, tech firms tend to be the engines of innovation and growth in the economy. That fact has only accelerated with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Second, the quarterly financial results of technology companies justify their stock\u2019s performance and lofty valuations. With the economy and consumer spending remaining resilient, there\u2019s no reason to assume that there will be an earnings downturn.\n\nLastly, technology companies, particularly the mega-cap variety, have a dominant position in the markets in which they compete. Some, it can be argued, have near-monopoly positions. That also looks unlikely to change or be seriously challenged in the near future. Here are seven longevity tech stocks extending investment horizons.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe good news keeps on coming for Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). The latest tailwind for the stock is that it\u2019s being added to the Nasdaq 100 index, replacing\r\npharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). SMCI stock will officially start trading on the Nasdaq 100 July 22. The Nasdaq 100 is comprised of the 100 largest non-financial companies in the broader Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 should give its stock a boost as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the index will now be required to buy its shares. Super Micro Computer makes servers that run AI microchips and processors and its products are in high demand worldwide. SMCI stock has more than tripled so far in 2024. Earlier this year, the company\u2019s stock was added to the benchmark S&P 500 index where it remains the top performing security.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) A chart of the MicroStrategy (MSTR) logo with a Bitcoin\n\nSource: JOCA_PH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of winning tech stocks, how about software firm turned Bitcoin (BTC-USD) powerhouse MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR)? The company\u2019s stock has performed nearly as well this year as Super Micro Computer. Since January, MSTR stock has gained 141%, driving its share price up to $1,654.18 and leading the company to announce a 10-for-1 stock split that goes into effect on August 8.\n\nWhile technically a provider of enterprise software, MicroStrategy has switched its focus in recent years and adopted an aggressive Bitcoin-buying strategy. Michael Saylor, the company\u2019s executive chairman, has said that MicroStrategy is now primarily focused on Bitcoin development and blockchain technologies. At the end of June this year, MicroStrategy owned 226,331 Bitcoin worth $14.59 billion based on the current price of the largest cryptocurrency.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at Wall Street firm Bernstein recently said that MicroStrategy is \u201cbuilding the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin company\u201d and that the stock has a further 80% upside.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nGoogle parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is well-known as a leader in AI. However, Alphabet is still a diversified technology company that has its tentacles in many other areas of technology, from smartphones to cybersecurity. The company\u2019s role in cybersecurity looks likely to expand with the expected acquisition of Wiz, a privately held firm that specializes in cybersecurity for cloud computing.\n\nMultiple media reports say Alphabet is planning to spend $23 billion to purchase Wiz, in what would be its biggest acquisition ever. Wiz was founded in 2020 and had been planning an initial public offering (IPO) later this year. However, it now looks as though Wiz will be content to sell itself to Alphabet instead. The purchase comes as Alphabet makes growing its cybersecurity offerings a key priority.\n\nIn 2022, Alphabet acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion. Alphabet\u2019s stock has risen 33% so far this year and the consensus rating among 38 analysts who cover the company is that the shares are a \u201cstrong buy.\u201d\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of \u201cstrong buy\u201d ratings, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) also holds one, along with a median price target that is 17% above where the stock currently trades. Investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently named Dell a \u201ctop pick\u201d and said the company\u2019s share price could rise as much as 40% over the next 12 months. At the start of July, Dell stock was added to Bank of America\u2019s (NYSE:BAC) coveted \u201cU.S. 1 List\u201d of top investment ideas.\n\nThe bullish sentiment is due to the opportunity Dell has in front of it with AI, notably the servers that run AI applications and models. That business is expected to accelerate and become more profitable in coming quarters. At the same time, Dell\u2019s core personal computer (PC) business is expected to outperform in coming quarters as a global refresh leads to accelerating PC sales this year and throughout 2025.\n\nDELL stock has increased 80% so far this year, with more gains likely, according to analysts.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo on an Apple store in Santa Monica, California.\n\nSource: View Apart / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs far as bullish sentiment goes, few stocks have experienced as big a turnaround in recent weeks as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). At the start of the year, Apple couldn\u2019t do anything right. The media was awash with headlines about slumping iPhone sales, rising competition in China, and a new augmented reality headset that, at more than $3,000, was too expensive for most consumers. But ever since Apple unveiled its AI strategy in June, its been blue skies for the company\u2019s stock.\n\nAAPL stock has risen 40% from a 52-week low reached in April. The shares are now up 25% on the year and trading near an all-time high on a split adjusted basis. The rebound comes after Apple announced plans to add advanced AI technology to future versions of the iPhone. Analysts say the addition of AI should spur global sales of the smartphone in coming years.\n\nAdditionally, Apple has just expanded sales of its Vision Pro augmented reality headset, rolling it out in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and U.K. Suddenly, Apple stock looks unstoppable once again.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nAs mentioned with Alphabet, cybersecurity remains a hot corner of technology right now. And among cybersecurity stocks, CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is the king. Over the past 12 months, CRWD stock has increased 143%, including a 50% gain so far this year. Analysts and investors stood up and cheered after the company\u2019s last financial results, which beat Wall Street estimates across the board.\n\nCrowdStrike reported EPS of 93 cents, which was above the 89 cents expected among analysts. Revenue for the year\u2019s first three months totaled $921 million, up 34% from a year earlier and ahead of estimates calling for $905 million in sales. CrowdStrike\u2019s free cash flow stood at $322.5 million at quarter\u2019s end, up 42% from a year ago. If there\u2019s a knock on CRWD stock it is the valuation.\n\nShares currently trade at nearly 700x future earnings estimates. While pricey, many analysts continue to see CrowdStrike as the de facto leader among cybersecurity stocks.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nWe\u2019ll end with a dark horse candidate: design software company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). The company behind products such as Photoshop, Illustrator and the PDF has seen its share price driven 3% lower this year over concerns that AI is going to effectively put it out of business. However, reports of Adobe\u2019s demise appear to have been greatly exaggerated based on the company\u2019s most recent quarterly print.\n\nADBE stock rose 17% after the company reported financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts and raised its full-year guidance. Adobe announced Q1 EPS of $4.48 compared to $4.39 that was expected among analysts. Revenue came in at $5.31 billion versus $5.29 billion that had been estimated. Sales rose 10% from a year earlier. Rather than be replaced by AI, management said on an earnings call that they are using the technology to their advantage.\n\nSpecifically, Adobe is adding AI across its suite of creative products, including Firefly and Illustrator, and charging a premium for it.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in GOOGL.

        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance Is Leaving The Nasdaq 100: Is This High-Yield Stock On The Ropes?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nBeing pushed out of an index is never a positive thing for a stock. It can be a sign that a company's best days as a strong grower are behind it. Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) has been pushed out of the Nasdaq 100 in favor of fast-moving Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), a hardware company that builds servers. The Nasdaq 100 is an index that tracks the performance of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The companies on the list cover various sectors, from tech to hospitality to pharmaceuticals. Leaving the list may be another sign that Walgreens is flashing a caution sign for dividend investors.\n\nPrivate credit offers up to 20% APY. Potential accredited investors are looking to capitalize on this growing asset class.\n\nTo be in the Nasdaq 100, companies must have a weighting of at least 0.1% of the Nasdaq 100's market value, now over $20 trillion. Walgreens' stock has fallen by over 56% year to date, paring its market cap down to around $10 billion, which puts it around 0.05%, too small for inclusion. The falling stock price has pumped up Walgreens' forward dividend yield to 8.55%, but that number can be deceptive. The annual dividend is just $1.00 because Walgreens cut its dividend at the start of 2024.\n\nWas The Move To Healthcare A Failure?\n\nSomething dramatic is happening with healthcare in the United States: a move to put more healthcare services in the places we visit most frequently. Large companies, from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Walgreens' rival CVS (NYSE:CVS), have all experimented with expanding healthcare services in their stores and beyond. Walgreens has spent heavily in this area. In 2022, it spent $8.9 billion to acquire Summit Health-CityMD. The vision expressed by then-CEO Roz Brewer was to combine Summit with Walgreens' existing investments in VillageMD with the expectation that healthcare services would command a larger and larger part of Walgreens' revenue.\n\nSo far, that grand plan has failed to pay off. The new CEO, Tim Wentworth, is focused on the bottom line and hasn't seen health care pay off as the company had hoped. He's now trying to wind down the company's investment in VillageMD. Speaking with analysts on the most recent earnings call, he stated: \"We would continue to have some investment and participate in their growth. It will take time. And as I said, we are looking for a different horizon for what we will invest strategically under our leadership.\" During that quarter, Walgreens wrote off $5.8 billion in goodwill related to the money it spent on VillageMD.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf the all-in-on-healthcare plan exited the company along with the last CEO, what does that mean for the future? Wentworth sees Walgreens' value as centered on its core retail and pharmacy businesses. \"The bottom line is that I'm confident WBA will be a leader in the future of health care with pharmacy and retail at its center,\" said Wentworth. \"And the long-term potential of the company will be shaped by offerings built around the relationship that we\u2019ve nurtured with our customers over time.\"\n\nFor investors, that means we should think about Walgreens more as a retail company, as judged by sales within its stores. For the most recent quarter, sales were up 2.6%, much of which was driven by pharmacy growth as retail declined. The company is in the midst of a plan to close underperforming stores and shore up the pharmacy business. Will it pay off? Sentiment in the market is relatively negative. Short interest in Walgreens recently spiked to 9.39%, and in the last month, a dozen analysts have lowered their price targets.\n\nTrending: Mark Cuban believes \u201cthe next wave of revenue generation is around real estate and entertainment\u201d \u2014 this new real estate fund allows you to get started with just $100.\n\nIs The Rival A Safer Bet?\n\nIt hasn't been an easy few years for the pharmacy business. After the rush from the pandemic vaccine boom wore off, pharmacies struggled with lower traffic and fewer sales. Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy in 2023 and announced closing more stores nationwide.\n\nCVS (NYSE:CVS) may still appeal to investors. While its forward dividend yield is a far lower 4.53%, it raised its quarterly dividend to $0.67 this year. Like Walgreens, CVS has invested heavily in health care, which has slowly paid off. Its last quarter disappointed the market, and CVS lowered its earnings per share guidance. Short interest in this stock is far lower, a mere 1.47%, and analysts are far more optimistic about its prospects with an overall consensus Buy rating.\n\nThe transition to health care is no sure thing, and some of the big companies above have already scaled back operations. In April, Walmart decided to close its clinics, and Amazon also scaled back its ambitions. CVS may be best positioned to turn clinic health care into a profitable business model, but investors will want to weigh that risk carefully before making a purchase.\n\nCheck Out One Of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\n\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\n\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over a 2-year period starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

        "title": "3 Cloud Computing Stocks That Could Grow Your Wealth",
        "content": "Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, data storage, networking, software, and analytics over the Internet or \u201ccloud.\u201d Its advantages include faster speeds and more flexible resources. It also enables companies to achieve economies of scale with their computing services. Given its advantages, it should not be surprising to learn that cloud computing is growing exponentially.\n\nThe global market for cloud computing could grow from $720.99 billion in 2023 to $2.22 trillion by 2031. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15%. In one way or another, almost all of the mega-cap technology stocks are cloud computing stocks. And the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is helping to fuel the sector\u2019s growth.\n\nHere are three cloud computing stocks that could grow your wealth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) sign reading Google inside building\n\nSource: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) could boost its role in cloud computing through a potential $23 billion acquisition of privately held cybersecurity firm Wiz. Wiz provides cybersecurity specifically for cloud-computing platforms and services. If successfully completed, the acquisition of Wiz would be Alphabet\u2019s biggest deal ever and help advance its cloud computing offerings.\n\nSince the division turned profitable about a year ago, Google Cloud has been a bright spot for Alphabet. In this year\u2019s first quarter, Google Cloud posted revenue of $9.57 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $9.35 billion. The operating income in Google\u2019s cloud business more than quadrupled to $900 million in Q1, demonstrating that the company is generating substantial profits in that business segment.\n\nGOOGL stock has risen 50% in the last 12 months, including a 35% gain so far in 2024.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) makes the servers that enable other companies to build cloud computing infrastructure. Demand for its servers among cloud computing firms has helped to propel Super Micro Computer\u2019s sales and stock to new heights. Not only is SMCI stock the best performer in the S&P 500 index this year, but it has just been announced that the stock is being added to the Nasdaq 100 index.\n\nSuper Micro Computer stock will officially be added to the Nasdaq 100 before trading on July 22, replacing Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). The change reflects both the rise of Super Micro Computer\u2019s stock and the sharp decline in Walgreens\u2019 market value. Super Micro\u2019s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 should boost its stock. This is because mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that track the index will buy the shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nSMCI stock has more than tripled year to date, giving the company a market capitalization of $53 billion. Earlier this year, the stock was added to the S&P 500 index, which it now sits atop based on its performance.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) The entrance sign of Salesforce Tower, at the American cloud-based software company Salesforce's (CRM stock) Headquarters campus in San Francisco, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a cloud computing stock that\u2019s on sale, look to Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). The company\u2019s share price is completely flat on the year (down 0.23%) following a poor earnings report for this year\u2019s first quarter. However, CRM stock is starting to show signs of a rebound as we enter the year\u2019s second half, with its stock having risen 11% in the past month. That\u2019s helped erase much of the loss right after the Q1 print.\n\nWhile the Q1 readout was bad, with Salesforce missing its quarterly revenue target for the first time since 2006, the company appears to be bouncing back. In June, Salesforce, the world\u2019s biggest cloud computing firm, announced that it is opening a new AI center. The company said it plans to eventually create 500,000 AI-related jobs in the U.K. region.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in GOOGL.

        "title": "2 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Stocks With Yields Above 8% That You Can Buy With $100 Right Now",
        "content": "If you're looking for dividend stocks that can turn a modest investment into a significant source of passive income, you may want to turn your attention to the S&P 500 index. At the moment, a pair of its components, Altria Group(NYSE: MO) and Walgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA), offer mind-blowing dividend yields of about 8.2% and higher.\n\nStocks rarely offer yields above 8% unless investors have reason to assume dividend growth in the years ahead will stall. Here's a look at these two ultra-high-yield dividend payers to see if they're good stocks to buy now and hold over the long run.\n\n1. Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nWith nearly 9,000 stores spread across all 50 states, and a few thousand more stores in Europe and Latin America, retail pharmacy chains don't get any bigger than Walgreens Boots Alliance.\n\nUnfortunately, economies of scale aren't much of an advantage when pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) run by insurance companies can dictate reimbursement rates on prescription drugs.\n\nCigna, UnitedHealth Group, and CVS Health operate the largest PBMs. Their contracts with pharmacies are famously secretive, but it doesn't look like they're giving Walgreens its fair share. The giant pharmacy chain reported a $13.2 billion operating loss in its fiscal second quarter that ended on Feb. 29.\n\nUnfavorable reimbursement rates aren't the only problem weighing on Walgreens' bottom line. Its attempt to expand beyond retail and become a provider of healthcare services has been a disaster. The big operating loss in its fiscal second quarter was partly due to a $5.8 billion impairment charge associated with its VillageMD investment.\n\nVillageMD is a joint venture with Cigna that was supposed to manage hundreds of full-service health clinics colocated with Walgreens pharmacies. The venture took a big step back in May when Walgreens said it would close about 160 VillageMD clinics this year. WBA Chart\n\nWalgreens slashed its dividend, but the stock price has fallen so far that at recent prices it still offers a huge 8.7% yield.\n\nWalgreens stock has been beaten down so far that folks who buy the stock now could realize market-thumping gains if earnings stop shrinking. The stock has been trading for the extremely low multiple of 4.0 times forward-looking earnings expectations.\n\nSecond-quarter retail pharmacy sales in the U.S. rose 4.7%, but the segment still reported adjusted operating income that fell 29.5% year over year. Walgreens might look undervalued, but a deteriorating profit margin for its U.S. pharmacy segment is a red flag, warning us to avoid this falling knife for now.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Altria Group\n\nAltria Group is the tobacco company that sells the Marlboro brand in the U.S. Marlboro still has a leading share of the market for combustible cigarettes, but that market is shrinking fast. The company sold 10% fewer cigarettes in the first three months of 2024 than it did in the previous-year period.\n\nA stock market concerned with sinking sales has Altria Group stock under so much pressure that it offers an eye-popping 8.2% yield. That's a lot more than you'd expect from a business that raised its dividend 58 times over the past 54 years.\n\nAltria Group's first attempt to transition customers from combustible tobacco to e-vapor products with Juul was a little too successful. In 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the fruity flavors that made Juul a hit with adults and teens, but enforcement hasn't been very strong. Altria Group has since sold Juul and acquired NJOY, an e-cigarette manufacturer that markets FDA-authorized products.\n\nThese days, Altria Group has to compete with illicit disposable e-vapor products such as Elf Bar. You won't find illicit e-cigarettes at major retailers like Walgreens, but independently owned tobacco shops and gas stations regularly display them right next to Altria Group's relatively flavorless NJOY brand.\n\nDespite combustible cigarette shipments that sank 10%, Altria Group reported first-quarter sales after excise taxes that contracted by just 1% year over year. An ability to raise prices on Marlboros and transition smokers to other products is allowing the bottom line to move in the right direction. Management expects earnings per share to rise by 2% to 4.5% this year to a range between $5.05 and $5.17 per share.\n\nIn June, Altria's NJOY brand received the first FDA authorization for a menthol-flavored product, which could help it compete with illicit flavored vaporizers. Cautious investors probably want to wait for signs of success from NJOY, as well as increasing enforcement of the FDA's flavor ban, before taking a chance on this stock. For those with less aversion to risk, starting a relatively small position looks like the right move to make now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Things You Need to Know if You Buy Walgreens Boots Alliance Stock Today",
        "content": "If you're thinking about buying shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA) anytime soon, you'll need to appreciate the position that the well-known pharmacy and retailer is currently in. Amidst an attempt to integrate into healthcare markets outside of its traditional wheelhouse, the company's financial position has deteriorated, and it's on the road to becoming downright precarious.\n\nBut some investors may see the potential for things to improve where others might only appreciate risks. So let's investigate three items you need to understand before buying this stock.\n\n1. It's facing stiff competition in its only real growth segment\n\nOver the last few years, Walgreens has tried to enter the primary-care market by providing some basic services through its VillageMD subsidiary. The move was a bid to enter into a quickly growing market so Walgreens could get exposure to a tailwind for its growth. There is some evidence that the plan is working.\n\nSales in its healthcare segment rose by 8% year over year in its third fiscal quarter, reaching $2.1 billion. That's a significantly larger amount of growth than in the core retail pharmacy business, which grew revenue by 2.3% to arrive at $28.5 billion, while adjusted gross profit fell by 6.7%.\n\nSo even if the healthcare segment isn't very large in comparison to the others, it's the fastest-growing. And it's on track to yield operating profits, as its adjusted operating losses were just $22 million, an improvement of $150 million from a year prior. But if CVS Health has anything to say about it, Walgreens will face a stiff headwind to its growth segment.\n\nAt the moment, CVS generates far more free cash flow (FCF) each quarter than Walgreens does. It's also more profitable, and a larger business. And it's making the same diversification attempt into primary care, right when Walgreens is.\n\nPut differently, with Walgreens in retreat and CVS on the advance, the gap between the two in the primary-care segment will only grow from here. That's something you need to know if you're thinking of buying either stock.\n\n2. It doesn't have a great track record for investing its capital efficiently\n\nAs an investor, it's important to know whether a business is going to make good use of the capital it has on hand, as well as the capital it can draw on in the form of debt and shareholders' equity. On that basis, Walgreens leaves a lot to be desired, and it has for a long time. Take a look at this chart: WBA Operating Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAs you can see, over the last 10 years its three-year median return on invested capital (ROIC) and its return on assets (ROA) have decreased and are negative. Effectively that means its capital investments over the last three years have largely been value-destroying rather than value-generating, and that its existing assets are not being operated in a way that creates a positive return.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor a retail footprint-intensive company like Walgreens, another takeaway from these figures is that its retail locations are, on average, no longer the good investments that they may have been in the past. This is substantiated by its plans to shutter many of its stores over the coming years. An additional risk is that as those stores are closed and the real estate is sold off, the company won't be able to recoup the cost of buying the land in the first place.\n\n3. It's unclear how management is planning to turn things around\n\nIn its third-quarter earnings announcement, when Walgreens announced a significant reduction in its number of locations, management signaled that a general transformation of the business was ahead. But there were few specifics about what the result would be after the transformation was complete -- an ambiguity that any potential investors need to understand in full.\n\nFor instance, it's clear that the pharmacy segment will continue on. Beyond that, it's hard to see how management is going to rekindle growth, or at least to stem the substantial and growing losses from operations.\n\nThe diversification play into providing primary care via the VillageMD subsidiary is now at risk, with management mentioning that it may be necessary to \"unlock liquidity.\" That could mean anything from backing out of advance purchasing deals to recoup cash, to selling off assets that might currently be productive.\n\nA temporary retreat from the far reaches of its primary-care ambitions would imply the opportunity to return later, when financial conditions improve. But a fire sale would likely slam that door shut. Management simply isn't sharing enough information for investors to know which route is favored, and it's key for anyone considering an investment to appreciate that.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Time to Buy 2024's Worst-Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks?",
        "content": "The S&P 500 as a whole is testing new all-time highs, but not all stocks are performing well. Some iconic companies have lost more than 40% of their value since 2024 began.\n\nAnd now could be the time to buy one of these S&P 500 laggards.\n\nDown 56%, is this major retailer a screaming buy?\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA) is a well-known American company. Headquartered just outside Chicago, Illinois, the company operates more than 8,000 retail and pharmacy locations serving nearly 9 million people every day.\n\nSince 2024 began, Walgreens stock has fallen 56%. The S&P 500, by comparison, has risen 17%. The collapse has brought Walgreens' market capitalization down from $22 billion at the beginning of the year to just under $10 billion. The stock's price-to-earnings ratio, meanwhile, has fallen to 32 times earnings as of this writing.\n\nWhat's going on? The biggest issue is that pharmacy benefit managers -- the intermediaries between pharmacies and health insurers -- have been squeezing pharmacies on reimbursement rates. It's an industrywide problem, but unlike many of its competitors, Walgreens doesn't own a major pharmacy benefit manager. The result is shrinking margins.\n\nThe company has also struggled with poor acquisitions. Its recent VillageMD acquisition, for example, has destroyed a ton of shareholder value. Purchased for $5 billion in 2021, the business has generated hundreds of millions of dollars in losses for Walgreens, which now plans to shutter hundreds of locations.\n\nIs now the time to buy? Not if competing pharmacy Rite-Aid is any indication. That company filed for bankruptcy less than 12 months ago due to many of the same pressures. While Walgreens stock may look like a bargain, its future will be dictated by a force it doesn't control: the decisions of major pharmacy benefit managers. Shares appear cheap according to some valuation metrics -- shares trade at just 4 times forward earnings estimates, for instance -- but it's wiser to stick with companies that better control their own futures, like the next stock on this list.\n\nThis big brand stock is no lemon\n\nLike Walgreens, Lululemon Athletica(NASDAQ: LULU) has had a tough 2024. Shares are down 44% since the year began, but the recent slide masks what has otherwise been an impressive long-term performance. Over the past decade, Lululemon stock is up over 600%, while Walgreens has declined nearly 85%.\n\nWhy is this once high-flying stock in the bargain bin? As Fool contributor Jennifer Saibil explains: \"Many investors have turned pessimistic about Lululemon. Growth is slowing, and it's facing fierce competition from new companies like Alo Yoga and Vuori, not to mention the regular competition from Nike and similar companies. In the pressured inflationary environment, it's also likely that some of its customers are switching down.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nYet Lululemon remains, undeniably, a leading apparel brand. The company enjoys high levels of customer loyalty, and its premium prices reflect that reality, even if sales growth has been pressured more recently. The company is still guiding for 11% to 12% revenue growth this year, and management recently raised its full-year earnings guidance from $14.10 to $14.37 per share. Management also doubled down on the struggling share price by initiating a $1 billion stock repurchase plan.\n\nAt the start of 2024, Lululemon stock traded at a pricey 65 times earnings. After the correction, shares trade at just 23 times earnings. That's a terrific price for a growing, iconic apparel company with its best days likely still ahead of it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lululemon Athletica right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lululemon Athletica, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Lululemon Athletica wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In the stock market, finding stocks at 52-week lows with the potential to yield massive price returns is a way to capitalize on undervalued assets. Certain companies hold solid fundamental strengths and strategic adaptations that extend beyond current market sentiments. Here, the focus is on seven stocks that might recover and thrive. Each company\u2019s unique fundamental base provides a snapshot of its market valuation possibilities.\n\nThe first one on the list continues to innovate its payment solutions and enhance enterprise transaction rates.\u00a0The second company is riding high on box office successes and a solid content pipeline. Meanwhile, the third one strategically adjusts its retail and pharmacy operations to address sector-specific challenges. Other companies on this list are similarly positioned at the intersection of market adversity and potential resurgence.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) operates a digital payment platform that provides online payment solutions. The company is enhancing its branded checkout experiences for large enterprises, as evidenced by the introduction of Fast Lane. Initial testing shows promising results, with a nearly 80% conversion rate among returning users (Q1 2024). This strategic focus aims to increase transaction completion rates, driving revenue growth from enterprise clients. PayPal Complete Payments, aimed at small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), has expanded to over 34 countries and continues to add new features.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdditionally, adoption metrics reveal that merchants adopting PayPal Complete Payments integrate an average of four PayPal products, significantly increasing revenue per account compared to legacy integrations. PayPal\u2019s consumer-focused initiatives, such as the revamped PayPal app and the introduction of the PayPal debit card, have shown tangible results. Hence, these efforts have increased engagement metrics, including a\u00a038% rise in debit card first-time users and higher transaction activity per user.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) A close-up of the blue and yellow Warner Bros (WBD) sign.\n\nSource: Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) prevails in entertainment and digital content production. The company has derived over $1.8 billion in global box office revenues since 2024\u2019s beginning. It leads the industry with successful releases like Dune: Part Two and Godzilla x Kong. With significant upcoming releases, such as new Lord of the Rings movies and ongoing successful television series like House of the Dragon, the company has a solid breadth of the content pipeline.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, investments in production facilities, like the expansion at Leavesden Studios, underscore the company\u2019s commitment to enhancing creative output while maintaining financial discipline. The sequential improvement in ad sales across\u00a0direct-to-consumer and linear platforms was driven by successful events like March Madness and a\u00a0robust content lineup. Resilient ad revenue growth in EMEA markets, particularly in Poland, Italy and Germany, showcases the effectiveness of legacy broadcast assets and strategic ad placement. Thus, leveraging AI and data-driven systems to optimize ad targeting and recommendation algorithms enhances consumer engagement and maximizes ad revenue potential across platforms.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NYSE:WBA) operates in pharmacy-led health and wellness services. The company\u2019s Q3 fiscal 2024 sales grew by 2.5% (FX neutral basis) to $36.4 billion. Here, the growth\u00a0is observed\u00a0across its international and U.S. healthcare segments. Looking specifically at the U.S. pharmacy business, Walgreens derived a 5.7% increase in pharmacy comparable sales driven by brand inflation and volume growth.\n\nHowever, Medicaid redeterminations and regulatory pressures influence overall prescription market growth. These temporary adversities have contributed to a decline in pharmacy-adjusted gross margins. Specifically, these issues are exacerbated by brand mix impacts and fluctuations in National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) pricing.\n\nWalgreens has initiated several strategic initiatives to counter these challenges and stabilize and revitalize its business operations. Hence, Walgreens is on the stocks at 52-week lows list due to top-line growth against pricing pressures and strategic adjustments.\n\nNew Fortress Energy (NFE) Momentum stocks: Natural gas pipeline through green field with blue sky above\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNew Fortress Energy (NASDAQ:NFE) focuses on natural gas infrastructure and logistics. The company is providing energy solutions, particularly in underserved markets. New Fortress Energy reported a robust quarterly performance with $340 million in EBITDA, aligning closely with expectations and maintaining guidance for the year ahead. Indeed, this financial stability is crucial for supporting ongoing operations and expansion efforts. New Fortress initially secured a 25 TBtu contract post-Hurricane Maria, providing substantial cost savings and reliability improvements to Puerto Rico\u2019s energy grid.\n\nFollowing this success, New Fortress expanded its operations significantly with an additional 80 British thermal units (TBtu) contract. It is doubling the fuel supply commitment from 40 to 80 TBtu. This expansion is expected to generate approximately 2 million tons of LNG annually, meeting about one-third of Puerto Rico\u2019s current energy demand. The shift from distillate fuels to natural gas under these contracts will save Puerto Rico billions annually while significantly reducing emissions.\n\nOverall, the strong performance, business leads, and significant investments solidify New Fortress\u2019s presence on the 52-week lows list.\n\nBCE (BCE) A mobile phone displaying the BCE homepage on its screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nBCE (NYSE:BCE) provides wireless, internet, TV and media services across Canada. The company\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 0.8 percentage\u00a0points to 42.7%, while operating costs decreased by 2% annually. BCE demonstrated strong operational efficiency in Q1. This improvement highlights BCE\u2019s effective cost-management strategies and operational discipline. BCE had its best Q1 retail Internet net additions in 17 years, up 13.9% to 31,078. A significant growth in households subscribing to mobility and internet bundles with fiber contributes to a 22% annual increase. BCE\u2019s\u00a0strong\u00a0fiber optics and internet services performance underscores its competitive advantage.\n\nMoreover, Q1 mobile phone postpaid net activations increased 4.5% to 45,247. BCE has a stable blended average revenue per user (ARPU) despite competitive pricing pressures. BCE\u2019s wireless segment showed robust performance, significantly increasing postpaid net activations. The stable ARPU amid competitive pricing indicates BCE\u2019s\u00a0effective\u00a0management of pricing and customer acquisition tactics.\n\nIn short, BCE\u2019s solid operational efficiency and subscriber growth support its high mark on the stocks at 52-week lows list.\n\nXP (XP) The Brazilian flag with the sun in the background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nXP (NASDAQ:XP) is a financial services company offering brokerage, investment banking and wealth management services in Brazil. The company attained a robust 28% annual growth in total gross revenue (Q1 2024). This growth\u00a0was supported\u00a0by the diversification of its ecosystem and\u00a0strong\u00a0performance in debt capital markets (DCM) activities. The corporate and issuer services segment, which contributed 12% of total revenue, saw significant annual growth of 91%, indicating XP\u2019s effectiveness in leveraging its wholesale banking capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, XP has solid metrics for client acquisition and engagement. Total client assets grew by 20% annually, reaching R$1.14 trillion,\u00a0reflecting\u00a0solid\u00a0inflows and market appreciation. Further, active clients increased by 16% over 12 months to\u00a04.587 million, highlighting XP\u2019s ability to expand its client base effectively. Moreover, the company has a growth in total advisers to 17,700, up 16% over Q1 2023.\u00a0Hence, this\u00a0demonstrates XP\u2019s expanding distribution capability across various advisory channels.\n\nCVR Energy (CVI) The logo for CVR Energy (CVI) is shown on a cellphone next to a screen displaying the company's website.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCVR Energy (NYSE:CVI) operates as an independent petroleum refiner and marketer, primarily in the U.S. The company attained a consolidated net income of $90 million and earnings per share of 81 cents. It derived an EBITDA of $203 million, indicating solid operational earnings. The company declared a regular dividend of 50 cents per share.\u00a0This reflects a high annualized dividend yield of approximately 6%, considered best-in-class among independent refineries.\n\nMoreover, the company processed approximately 196,000 barrels daily with a late product yield of 101% on crude oil.\u00a0This\u00a0indicates efficient refinery operations and high yield efficiency. Similarly, CVR Energy processed 7 million gallons of vegetable oil feedstocks at the Wynnewood renewable diesel unit. Indeed, the expansion plans include a potential conversion to 100% sustainable aviation fuel at the Wynnewood unit, highlighting future growth potential in the renewable energy sector.\n\nTo conclude, CVR Energy\u2019s robust operational edge, earnings, and dividend yield make it a top choice among stocks at 52-week lows.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in PYPL, WBD and\u00a0WBA.

PYPL stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a\u00a0major\u00a0online transaction and payment platform. The company derived 10% top-line growth in Q1 2024 to hit $7.7 billion.\u00a0This\u00a0demonstrates high top-line growth, suggesting the company\u2019s fundamental ability to derive solid revenue despite macro challenges. The constant revenue increase indicates a high demand for PayPal\u2019s services. Its massive client base includes large enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and consumers. Total payment volume (TPV) grew by 14% annually (FX-neutral). This sharp growth in TPV reflects the increasing transactions processed through PayPal\u2019s platform.\u00a0Hence, this\u00a0marks the company\u2019s expanding user base and loyalty to its payment solutions.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, international\u00a0TPV grew 17% annually on a FX-neutral basis.\u00a0This\u00a0is driven primarily by strength in continental Europe and improvement in Asia. This geographical diversification reduces dependency on any single market and positions PayPal for continued expansion. The transaction margin dollar performance increased by 4%, which was better than expected. This higher transaction margin indicates that PayPal effectively manages its cost structure while growing its transaction volume.

        "title": "Walgreens Boots Alliance Stock Hits 27-Year Lows. Has It Become a Steal of a Deal?",
        "content": "Buying a stock on weakness can be a dangerous idea. Imagine a stock that you think may be a decent buy falls to a new 52-week low. Then a few weeks later, it hits a new low. Then another. And after a while of this tailspin, it's at a multiyear low. That's what many investors have been experiencing with Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA).\n\nShares of the pharmacy retailer are not just near their 52-week lows but they recently even hit 27-year lows. This kind of an extreme sell-off suggests that there are serious problems under the hood that make the stock too risky of an option for many investors to consider. Let's take a look at just how risky Walgreens is, and whether it's a good contrarian buy right now, or if it is nothing more than a value trap at this point.\n\nProfitability is the biggest concern for Walgreens\n\nWalgreens has a lot of fires to put out. The business isn't generating much growth, it's facing a lot of competition from Walmart and Amazon, and it probably doesn't help that rival Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy last year. But if Walgreens improves its prospects for long-term profit growth, that can take care of what I think is its biggest issue. That's because if the company isn't generating strong margins, it won't be able to compete on price, it'll likely burn through cash, and it won't have nearly as many resources at its disposal to invest in its future growth.\n\nTechnically, Walgreens is profitable. In its most recent quarter (ended May 31), it reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.40, which was actually better than a year ago, when it incurred impairment charges and EPS was just $0.14. But net earnings of $344 million were just 0.9% of the $36.4 billion that Walgreens reported in sales. Its margins need to be a whole lot better. Otherwise, there isn't much of a buffer there for the business to be more aggressive on price or to be able to absorb an increase in costs, such as those related to its investments into healthcare and the launch of primary care clinics.\n\nReducing its footprint could help\n\nNew CEO Tim Wentworth is looking at scaling down the business by closing down locations, particularly underperforming ones. Wentworth recently said, \"Seventy-five percent of our stores drive 100% of our profitability today.\"\n\nWith a stat like that, the writing looks to be on the wall for Walgreens: It needs to cut down on the number of stores it has. Assessing which stores to keep and which to close down is a key part of the strategic review the company is undertaking. But with more than 8,000 stores, the task of shuttering potentially thousands of underperforming stores is bound to be a time-consuming process. However, in the long run, it can help Walgreens achieve a smaller footprint and incur less in administrative expenses, putting the company in a better position to achieve stronger margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalgreens will benefit from a much leaner and more efficient operating model. But it isn't going to be an easy turnaround by any means, and it could take a while to know whether the company is indeed on the right track.\n\nIs Walgreens a good contrarian buy or just a value trap?\n\nWalgreens stock has plummeted 76% in three years. For the shares to reverse course, it won't be easy. If it does, however, then there's certainly the case to be made that there may be a lot of upside for the healthcare stock.\n\nBut even if you're a contrarian investor, this may simply be too risky of a stock to own. Walgreens has a lot going on right now, and what its business may look like in five or 10 years is anyone's guess. And with so much uncertainty, it's hard to put a value on what the company is really worth given all those unknowns and all the challenges it's facing today.\n\nWhile it may appear to be cheap, Walgreens definitely looks like a value trap right now. It may seem like a bargain trading at just 6 times its trailing earnings. But what good is that number if the company's earnings deteriorate further in the years ahead, particularly as it invests heavily into healthcare and launches more primary care clinics?\n\nWalgreens just isn't worth the risk. Investors are probably better off taking a wait-and-see approach with the stock. You may miss out on some potential gains if the turnaround goes well, but you could also avoid significant losses if it doesn't.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why Is Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA) the Best High Yield Dividend Stock With Upside Potential?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks With Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) stands against the other stocks with over 8% dividend yield.\n\nHigh yields have always sparked debate between analysts and investors. Analysts typically advise caution with extremely high yields, while investors often find them attractive. Analysts' concerns are valid; high yields can sometimes be warning signs of financial instability within a company. Many companies offering exceptionally high yields have been on the brink of cutting or suspending their dividends. That said, no company is completely out of the woods regarding its challenges, and dividend yield plays a minor role in a company's financial difficulties. In fact, many reports have highlighted that high-yield stocks have performed well over the years.\n\nNewton Investment Management published a report revealing that high-yield dividend stocks outperformed the broader market during high inflationary periods from 1940 to 2021. The report also showed that investment portfolios with high-yield dividend stocks outperformed those with low or no dividend stocks in terms of value-weighted performance. High-yield portfolios outpaced low-yield ones by 199 basis points and zero-yield portfolios by 330 basis points. This outcome is informative, yet it does not provide insights into the market conditions of that time, offering only a general overview of high-yield stock performance. Analysts have been particularly attentive to how dividend stocks perform during periods of market volatility, recognizing that the demand for regular income is most keenly felt during these times. Therefore, analysts recommend considering stocks with high yields only if these companies also demonstrate strong dividend growth streaks.\n\nThe S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrat Index seeks to track the performance of companies with at least 20 consecutive years of dividend growth with an average dividend yield of 3%. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a backdrop of slowing growth but rising inflation, the index achieved a monthly average total return of 0.39% from 1999 through April 2024, surpassing the benchmark by approximately 120 basis points. Historically, inflationary environments have typically benefited short-duration stocks like Dividend Aristocrat companies. During slow growth phases with declining inflation, the performance of the High Yield Dividend Aristocrats has aligned closely with the benchmark. The report further mentioned that the dividend growth rate for the index also surpassed inflation over the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs mentioned above, when investing in dividend stocks, high yield and dividend growth must go hand in hand, as many companies have shown that it is indeed possible. Analysts typically view yields between 3% to 7% as healthy. The health of dividend stocks is often assessed based on their ability to generate cash flow and their track record of dividend growth. Investors favor stocks that not only offer high yields but also maintain or steadily increase their dividend payouts, rather than frequently cutting them. Examples include some of the best dividend stocks such as Altria Group, Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., and British American Tobacco p.l.c. that have above-average dividend yields coupled with robust dividend growth histories. To read more about strong dividend payers, have a look at Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we screened for dividend stocks with yields higher than 8% as of July 8. Then, we narrowed down the choices by finding stocks with an upside potential according to analyst predictions. Finally, we selected companies with the most hedge fund investors holding stakes in them, using Insider Monkey's Q1 2024 database. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge fund investors having stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:WBA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 41\n\nDividend Yield as of July 8: 9.20%\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) tops our list of the best dividend stocks with over 8% yield. The company owns and operates retail pharmacy chains and other pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution companies. In a disappointing start to 2024, the company cut its dividend after maintaining a streak of 47 consecutive years of growth. The decision aimed to retain more cash to support growth initiatives and bolster its balance sheet.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)'s new CEO, Tim Wentworth, is on a mission to turn things around for the company. In a recent development, he announced plans to close a significant number of underperforming stores and scale back the company's primary-care business ventures. Along with these closures, the company intends to implement a US Retail Pharmacy action plan aimed at enhancing customer and patient experiences across various channels. Additionally, the company will streamline and focus its U.S. Healthcare portfolio and align its U.S. pharmacy and Healthcare organizations to improve market capabilities.\n\nThe big question is whether these strategies are benefiting Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA). The fiscal Q3 2024 earnings revealed that the company is facing a challenging operating environment. Ongoing pressures on US consumers and recent market dynamics have negatively affected pharmacy margins. That said, the company generated revenues of $35.4 billion, up 2.6% from the same period last year and ahead of expectations. Cash position was also strong, with $605 million in operating cash flow and $334 million in free cash flow, showing an increase of $778 million from a prior-year period. Despite these bright spots, the negatives outweigh the positives for Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA). The company has lowered its guidance for the second time this year, concerning investors.\n\nThat said, there are some rays of hope with the new CEO and the measures being implemented, even if they take time. Additionally, the company's cash flow suggests a promising future for dividends, which will also be bolstered by cost-cutting efforts. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share and has an impressive dividend yield of 9.20%, as of July 8.\n\nThe number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) jumped to 41 in Q1 2024, from 31 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $715 million. Among these hedge funds, Sessa Capital was the company's leading stakeholder in Q1.\n\nOverall WBA ranks 1st on our list of the best high yield dividend stocks with upside potential. You can visit 10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks With Upside Potentialto see the other high yield dividend stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of WBA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than WBA but that trades at less than 7 times its earnings and yields nearly 10%, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Realty Income Remains Strong With High Dividends",
        "content": "Realty Income Corp. (NYSE:O) is among the 10 largest real estate investment trusts by market cap and stands out for a number of reasons, such as its interesting multiples, allowing for a dividend yield of almost 6% per year, and its monthly distribution.\n\nOn a year-to-date basis, the asset has performed poorly, down around 9% at the time of writing, impacted by the macroeconomic scenario - with high interest rates impacting real estate and operational assets and inflation impacting its main segment, which is retail - and with this, lower growth projections.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with O. List of 52-Week Lows List of 3-Year Lows List of 5-Year Lows\n\nAlthough there are other options on the market that may be just as good, with similar indicators, Realty Income stands out with an exceptional track record and a robust business model that should benefit from the turn of the macroeconomic cycle, continuing to present an interesting compound annual growth rate over the next few years.\n\nBusiness model and history\n\nRealty Income is a REIT that has properties mainly in the retail segment. But not just any type, its focus is on non-discretionary businesses, along with low price point and service-oriented businesses. All of its top 20 clients are in these categories, with Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), the three largest, accounting for just over 3% of annualized contractual rent each. Apart from the core business, the company also has efforts aimed at other segments, such as Industrial and Gaming, which are already starting to appear more prominently in the portfolio, as well as international expansion, with the U.K. already accounting for 11% of annualized contractual rent.\n\nIts business model is based on finding these opportunities and carrying out rigorous due diligence based on a series of factors, such as long-term industry trends, portfolio fit, investment spreads, internal rate of return and more. As a result, they are in a sustainable and conservative model, focused mainly on industry-leading clients with sustainable cash flow. To illustrate this, in the first quarter around $9 billion was found for acquisition opportunities, of which only $598 million was realized.\n\nThe power of this strategy can be seen in the company's track record. Not surprisingly, Realty Income is also known as \"The Monthly Dividend Company.\" Historically, its average dividend yield has been 6%, along with a CAGR of funds from operations of 5%, since 1994. Even in more difficult times, such as 2008 or the pandemic, its FFO continued to increase and the distribution of dividends was maintained.\n\nStory continues Realty Income Remains Strong With High Dividends\n\nSource: Realty Income presentation\n\nComplementing this track record, several indicators reinforce the quality of the operations, including its compound since its initial public offering in 1994 of 13.60% and the dividend compound of 4.30% over the same period. Further, the adjusted Ebitda margin improved from 92.40% in 2000 to 95% in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nEven with the latent trend of technology, e-commerce and the like, it is hard to imagine a scenario where Realty Income's clients and properties are disrupted. Looking at the materials available to investors, there is an emphasis on the sustainability of this model and this growth, with exposure to new sectors and asset types (ranging from data centers to vineyards) to achieve interesting growth, but without losing conservatism and attractive returns.\n\nIn other words, it seems very plausible to me the company will be able to continue growing at a similar rate in the long term.\n\nOne point of caution in the thesis, however, is the company is dependent on raising funds on the market, mainly debt, which means it has a large amount of debt. Although its capital structure is still very robust and its credit ratings are good, some monitoring is necessary in this regard, both in terms of operations and valuation. If interest rates continue to be high for longer, this could hinder the raising of new debt at more attractive rates and more interesting acquisitions, perhaps leading the company to resort to new capital increases (issuing new shares).\n\nAs for valuation, it's enough to note that Realty Income's market cap is $46 billion, while its enterprise value is $71.6 billion, which can lead to a misunderstanding when we do not consider debt in this figure.\n\nGood time to accumulate shares\n\nOne common saying with regard to the right time to buy a stock is \"buy on the sound of cannons and sell on the sound of trumpets,\" which, adapted for today's context, means the best time to buy a particular asset is when nobody wants it. As noted in the previous section, Realty Income is a company of impressive quality, but in recent months it has not received as much credit for this.\n\nAmong the reasons is the aforementioned macroeconomic scenario, with concerns about inflation and the global economy, as well as high interest rates that hinder acquisitions of new properties, in addition to \"sucking up\" the capital available for risky assets.\n\nThere seems to be a dynamic opportunity cost at the moment. On the one hand, the U.S. 10-year Treasury is paying 4.25% per year, below Realty Income's dividend yield, but still a high rate for a risk-free bond. On the other hand, for the bolder investors, there are tech stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), which have advanced more than 150% year to date and still maintain very optimistic prospects.\n\nAnother catalyst for this REIT's poor performance were the lower-than-expected results, such as in the fourth quarter of 2023, where the company missed the adjusted funds from operations, with the market expecting something close to $1.05 and the reported figure being $1.01, justified by a period where the increase in rental rates was overshadowed by higher management costs that reduced profitability.\n\nThe company provided some guidance for 2024, including $4.17 to $4.29 in normalized FFO per share. If at least the bottom is reached, it would have a price-to-FFO ratio of 12.70. The market consensus points to something closer to $4.22, which is close to the bottom and indicates a similar price-to-FFO ratio.\n\nThe projected dividend for the next 12 months is $3.16, or almost 6% if we take the current price into account. This level does not seem like a huge bargain, but it is certainly a considerable value for investors who like the thesis and this defensive model with monthly payments. The average dividend yield over the last 10 years has been 4.80%, and with the current yield at around 5.8%, it seems like a considerable discount.\n\nThe GF Value also suggests the REIT is modestly undervalued at the time of writing, with a fair price of $71.8 against the current price of $53, indicating a potential upside of 35%. Realty Income Remains Strong With High Dividends\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nRealty Income is a very defensive position, especially at these prices. It seems likely the company will be able to maintain a CAGR similar to that seen in the past, both through its core businesses when the global economy eases, and through its new avenues of expansion.\n\nThis, coupled with a dividend yield of almost 6% per year, distributed monthly, leads me to believe this REIT makes a lot of sense for income-focused investors looking for a high-quality asset with prospects of maintaining conservative but still interesting growth and distributing most of this growth via dividends.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The outlook of many healthcare stocks is quite positive at this point. That\u2019s partly because many large investors have shunned the sector, since they believe that it is destined to produce horrible returns as long as interest rates remain elevated.\n\nAs a result, many firms in the space have very attractive valuations. Moreover, even some expensive names, such as the leading companies in the diabetes sector and many makers of weight loss drugs, should perform well in the long run because the demand for their products will continue to grow rapidly.\n\nHowever, the large drug-store chains are being hit with many challenges. These include the huge settlements that they have to pay as a result of their role in the opioid epidemic, growing competition and the increased theft with which they have to contend in many areas of America.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd as is always the case, some drug makers\u2019 products are likely to fail over the longer term due to safety or efficacy issues. As a result, these companies\u2019 stocks have the potential to perform poorly over the long term.\n\nThese three healthcare stocks to sell in July all fit into one of those categories.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) is facing a plethora of problems. According to Bank of America, pharmacy benefit managers, the \u201cmiddlemen\u201d between drug makers and retailers, have been squeezing Walgreens\u2019 margins.\n\nWalgreens has also been hit by tough competition from the large retail chains such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT), along with increased utilization of direct mail prescription-filling services by consumers. Partly as a result of all of these factors, the company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share sank to 63 cents last quarter, down from 99 cents during the same period a year earlier.\n\nBut Walgreens is facing additional significant problems. The chain has acknowledged that its financial results have been hurt by increased shoplifting in some areas of the U.S. Moreover, inflation has made consumers less likely to pay the generally high prices that it charges for many items, compared to many of its competitors.\n\nAlso greatly undermining the outlook of WBA stock is the huge settlements that the firm has had to pay out as a result of its role in the opioid crisis. Largely as a result of these settlements, the company had a huge $33.66 billion of debt as of the end of the first quarter, along with only $711 million of cash.\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect its earnings per share to sink to $2.79 in 2025 from $3.98 in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nCassava (SAVA) Cassava Sciences (SAVA) company logo icon on website\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn June 28, \u00a0CUNY School of Medicine Professor Hoau-Yan\u00a0Wang was indicted by a grand jury for allegedly falsifying data related to Cassava\u2019s (NASDAQ:SAVA) only major drug candidate, simufilam. The company is hoping that simufilam, which is currently undergoing Phase 3 trials, will become a treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nBut Wang collaborated for many years with Cassava, and much of his research provided evidence that enabled simufilam to advance to clinical trials. Also importantly, CUNY, which employs Wang, previously found him guilty \u201cof scientific misconduct involving 20 research papers,\u201d many of which were related to simufilam.\n\nIf Wang did indeed lie about his research, it\u2019s possible that the information on the drug\u2019s efficacy and mechanism of action which the firm provided to the Food and Drug Administration is inaccurate. The FDA may have therefore approved clinical trials based on faulty information, and the agency could choose to halt the Phase 3 trial while it investigates the matter. If the agency does take that action, SAVA stock will almost certainly plunge much further.\n\nMoreover, given reporting from October 2023 that connects Chief Scientist Lindsay Burns to Wang, I believe that the FDA will be scrutinizing Cassava. Regulators will want to ensure that the company was not involved in knowingly submitting falsified data\n\nIf the FDA fails to harshly punish a company that knowingly submitted false data, many other biotech companies will follow suit in order to boost their stock prices and takeover prospects. This could create chaos in the sector and cause it to become toxic for investors. As a result, the agency will very likely take action against Cassava.\n\nFinally, those who are still bullish on SAVA stock have emphasized the success of the clinical trials involving simufilam. But the company has been credibly accused of manipulating those trials.\n\nGiven all of these points, Cassava is one of the best healthcare stocks to sell or short.\n\nModerna (MRNA) Moderna logo is seen at the entrance to its headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Moderna, Inc., (MRNA) is an American pharmaceutical and biotechnology company.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe revenue that Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) generated from its Covid-19 vaccine plunged by a huge two-thirds last year to $6.7 billion. CNBC noted that the decline occurred \u201cas cases and public concern about the virus dwindled from their pandemic peaks.\u201d As a result, the shot is unlikely to be a growth engine for the company.\n\nAnd although the company reported that the efficacy of its RSV vaccine \u201cagainst two or more\u2026 symptoms\u201d caused by the virus comes in at a respectable 50% after 18 months, its results are less impressive than those of the RSV vaccine developed by market leader GSK (NYSE:GSK). Plus, GSK\u2019s shot was approved a year before Moderna\u2019s, giving GSK another big advantage over Moderna in the RSV vaccine battle.\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect the company\u2019s revenue to sink to $3.85 billion this year from $6.85 billion in 2023.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a short position in SAVA.

        "title": "Valero and DR Horton Are on the Casualty List",
        "content": "Get em while they're cold.\n\nThat's the idea behind my Casualty List, a quarterly compendium of stocks that have recently been knocked down, and that I believe will rise again.\n\nYou'd never guess it from watching the market averages, but about half of all U.S. stocks were down in the past three months. That gives me ample fodder for the Casualty List.\n\nValero\n\nLeading off my second-quarter list is Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE:VLO), a large oil refiner whose stock fell about 8% in April through June.\n\nThe rise of electric cars is denting gasoline demand, and warm winters are reducing the need for heating oil. In addition, refineries in Asia and Latin America are providing more competition for American ones.\n\nI feel that the refiners have been punished too harshly. Valero, for example, still has a 5% after-tax profit margin, and scored a 27% return on stockholders' equity in the past four quarters. Yet the stock sells for less than eight times recent earnings. (The median ratio is about 24.)\n\nAnalysts think earnings will fall this year, and in 2025 and 2026 too. My hunch is that they are too pessimistic.\n\nD.R. Horton\n\nMortgage rates are a monkey wrench in the gears of the homebuilding industry. Lately, it costs close to 7% to finance a home. That's the most in about 20 years, though considerably less than the rates in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nNew home sales this spring were only a little above 600,000 per month. In homebuilding's heyday (October 2002 to May 2006) they were over a million a month. I believe that there is big pent-up demand for houses, and that a boom for homebuilders is likely in 2025 if mortgage rates come down a peg or two.\n\nD.R. Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is the nation's largest homebuilder, selling houses at a variety of price points in 33 states. The stock, down 14% in the second quarter, goes for nine times earnings.\n\nMetallus\n\nMetallus Inc. (NYSE:MTUS), of Canton, Ohio, makes steel and precision steel components. Its profitability is only so-so, but I like its balance sheet. Debt is a mere 3% of stockholders' equity, and the company has almost $12 of cash for every dollar of debt.\n\nThis small stock ($858 million market value) is almost totally neglected by Wall Street. Only three analysts follow it, all from small firms. The stock, down 9% in the second quarter, fetches about 12 times earnings.\n\nBall\n\nBall Corp. (NYSE:BALL), based in Westminster, Colorado, is the world's larger maker of metal cans. It has been consistently profitable and has increased its earnings by an average of about 6% a year over the past decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's not much compared to the big technology stocks that have captured investors' hearts and money in recent year. But Ball's net profit margin is 31%, in the same league as Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) at 36% and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 26%. After dropping 11% in the second quarter, Ball trades for 5 times earnings.\n\nWalgreens Boots\n\nTroubles abound at Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and its stock fell a sickening 43% in the second quarter. The company plans to close up to 25% of its 8,600 stores, and has considered separating the Walgreens chain in America from the Boots chain in Great Britain.\n\nYet for all its woes, Walgreens still earned $3.98 a share in 2023, and analysts predict that earnings will stay north of $3 a share through 2026. Given those estimates, the stock looks to me like a steal at the recent price of $11.26.\n\nThe record\n\nI've been compiling the Casualty list since 2000, and have one-year results for 81 lists. The average one-year return has been 14.69%, versus 11.00% for the Standard and Poor's 500 Total Return Index.\n\nOf the 81 lists, 51 were profitable and 39 beat the index.\n\nBear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn't be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn't predict the future.\n\nMy list from a year ago advanced 24.08%, not quite enough to beat the S&P's total return, which was 26.16%. My best pick from July 2023 was Acuity Brands Inc. (NYSE:AYI), up 49%. My worst was Columbia Sportswear Co. (NASDAQ:COLM), up less than 1%.\n\nI had a modest gain on Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY) and a 39% gain in Valero, which now finds itself on the Casualty List again.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments LLC in Boston, Massachusetts.

        "title": "Why Walgreens Boots Alliance Plunged in June",
        "content": "Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA) plunged 25.4% in June, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence .\n\nNews went from bad to worse for Walgreens, which had already been down severely on the year even before the month started. And after another plunge during the last three days of June, the stock was off 54% in the first half of 2024, making it the worst performer in the S&P 500.\n\nWhile pessimism already abounded, Walgreens' fiscal third-quarter results on June 27 only added to its shareholders' woes, with the stock taking yet another leg down.\n\nTaking down guidance again\n\nIn the third quarter, Walgreens posted revenue growth of 2.6%, which was actually ahead of expectations. The problem was on the bottom line, where adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share of $0.63 was down a whopping 36.6%, missing even pessimistic analyst expectations of $0.71. Furthermore, the company lowered its full-year adjusted earnings guidance for the second time in 2024 to a range of $2.80 to $2.95, down from the $3.20-to-$3.35 range it had guided in March -- and that was already lowered from the original guidance of $3.40 to $3.50.\n\nHow did revenue increase while profit decreased? Much of the pressure was felt in Walgreens' pharmacy business, where the concentrated pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) industry is squeezing pharmacies on reimbursement rates. The phenomenon is an industrywide problem. However, unlike some other retail pharmacies, Walgreens doesn't own one of the major PBMs, so it's seeing margin plummet in that important business. Meanwhile, Walgreens also saw its retail sales decline 2.3%, as a cash-strapped consumer appeared to pull back on more discretionary pharmacy purchases.\n\nMoreover, the company's acquisition of pharmacy care clinic VillageMD continues to struggle, with the healthcare clinic segment garnering a $220 million operating loss last quarter. While that was a $300 million improvement over the prior year, it still leaves the debt-laden company with an unprofitable unit to deal with.\n\nWalgreens has a new CEO, but a turnaround is uncertain\n\nOn the bright side, Walgreens still forecasts a profitable year, and it has a new CEO in Tim Wentworth, who took over last October, so he hasn't had much time to implement a turnaround. Moreover, Wentworth used to head Express Scripts, one of the three big PBMs, and which is currently owned by Cigna. With PBM experience, he may be able to help reverse the trends that have favored PBMs relative to retail pharmacies.\n\nStill, Wentworth has his work cut out for him. Walgreens is nearly $9 billion in debt, not counting operating leases, and its margin is squeezed, so investors would be wise to wait for signs of tangible progress on operational improvement and profitability before trying to time this turnaround.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Halfway Through 2024, These 3 Stocks Have Been the S&amp;P 500's Worst Performers",
        "content": "Through the first six months of 2024, the S&P 500 has risen by 15% in what is shaping up to be another strong year for the markets. But while it has been good news for many stocks on the index, there have been some extremely big disappointments as well.\n\nThree stocks that have generated disastrous returns thus far this year are Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Here's a look at why they have been struggling, and whether they're worth buying at their reduced prices.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance: Down 56%\n\nPharmacy retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance gets the distinction of being the S&P 500's worst-performing stock at the midway point of 2024. Unfortunately, Walgreens was already a likely candidate for this distinction at the start of the year.\n\nIn January, the company slashed its dividend in half as the new CEO, Tim Wentworth, has been on a mission to help turn around the struggling business.\n\nUnfortunately, it's not an easy task given that the healthcare company is still paying a (reduced) dividend, investing in a costly healthcare strategy that involves opening primary care clinics, and has a core business that normally generates thin margins as it is.\n\nWentworth has admitted the company's \"current pharmacy model is not sustainable\" and that the business is looking at potentially closing up to one-quarter of its 8,600 U.S. stores. Although sales grew at a modest rate of 2.6% for the quarter ending May 31, the company lowered its guidance for adjusted earnings this year, noting a \"worse-than-expected U.S. consumer environment.\"\n\nThere's simply no reason to expect a turnaround for Walgreens stock anytime soon. Wentworth has a tough task on his hands in trying to make the pharmacy chain a better business. And investors are better off not waiting to see how that will turn out -- this is an incredibly risky stock. It wouldn't surprise me if management ends up scrapping the entire dividend in the near future.\n\nLululemon Athletica: Down 41%\n\nLululemon is the second-worst performing stock on the S&P 500 this year. High-priced apparel simply isn't in high demand at a time when consumers are struggling to pay bills. Lululemon's business is still generating decent growth; it just isn't as good as what investors have been hoping for.\n\nIn the quarter ending April 28, the company reported revenue of $2.2 billion, a 10% increase year over year. And comparable-store sales were up 7% when excluding the impact of foreign currency. But its forecast for the current quarter calls for revenue growth between 9% and 10%.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf not for the company's elevated valuation, Lululemon's stock might not have crumbled as much as it has this year. Amid this sell-off, the stock is now trading at a much more reasonable 24 times trailing earnings. At the beginning of the year, it was at a multiple of more than 50.\n\nWith a price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 1.2, now could be an advantageous time to buy the stock. It possesses a strong brand, and the business is still generating some growth.\n\nIntel: Down 39%\n\nRounding out this list of disappointing stocks is Intel. The chipmaker's strategy to ramp up production in the U.S. hasn't convinced investors that it's a profitable move in the long run.\n\nIn the most recent quarter (ended March 30), the company's foundry unit incurred an operating loss totaling just under $2.5 billion, and its sales declined by 10% year over year.\n\nCEO Pat Gelsinger projects that the foundry business has a tough road ahead but will break even in 2027. If that proves to be the case, then Intel could reverse these losses in the future. Without the aid of a crystal ball, however, investors are left having to decide whether or not to take a chance on Intel's stock.\n\nNormally, I would be inclined to say no, but I believe there's a big incentive for the U.S. government to help support Intel to ensure there are far greater chipmaking capabilities on U.S. soil and less dependence on foreign countries.\n\nIntel is a bit of a contrarian play, but I think it has the potential to be a good buy for the long haul. It might not recover this year, but for investors willing to absorb some risk, it can make for a good buy-and-hold investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Just 1% of all stocks listed on the major U.S. exchanges are Dividend Aristocrats. These are the 67 companies listed on the S&P 500 that have raised their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more. It is an elite group of stocks recognized for their quality and consistency over time.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean their shares won\u2019t fall. In fact, many of the high-yield Dividend Aristocrats below are down in 2024 or have fallen over the past year. What separates them from other similarly situated stocks, though, is their resiliency. More often than not, they tend to bounce back stronger than they were.\n\nOf course, what attracts investors to this list of dividend royalty is their dividend.\u00a0 These reliable income streams juice a portfolio\u2019s total return helping the stocks to outperform non-payers over time. Analysts at Hartford Funds found that S&P stocks that initiated and raised their dividends handily beat any other class of stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet just like with share prices, being a Dividend Aristocrat stock doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t cut their payout. The most recent example is 3M (NYSE:MMM), which slashed its payout in half in May and was booted off of the list. Still, like physics, an object in motion tends to stay in motion and Dividend Aristocrats tend to keep paying and raising their payouts over time.\n\nThe royalty below sport yields nearly three times that of the S&P 500 and represent some of the best companies to buy now.\n\nHigh-Yield Dividend Aristocrat No. 1: Realty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nReal estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income (NYSE:O) doesn\u2019t have the longest track record of raising its payout amongst Dividend Aristocrats but it arguably has one of the most impressive. A monthly dividend REIT, it has made 648 consecutive monthly payments while raising the payout for 29 straight years since going public in 1994.\n\nUnlike office REITs, which have been especially depressed since the pandemic made the work-from-home phenomenon more widespread, Realty Income specializes in top-tier retail locations that typically feature a single store. Among its biggest tenants are dollar store chains Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), pharmacy chain Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), and convenience store chain 7-Eleven.\n\nIt should be pointed out that Walgreens just announced it would be closing many money-losing locations. The pharmacy didn\u2019t specify how many, and it is unknown how much of that real estate Realty Income owns, but the pharmacy chain only represents 3.4% of O\u2019s total portfolio. It means the REIT\u2019s diversification prevents any significant impact.\n\nStory continues\n\nRealty Income\u2019s dividend yields 5.9% annually. As it generates a significant amount of adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), a metric similar to free cash flow (FCF) for REITs, its dividend is secure.\n\nAmcor (AMCR) green beer bottles in a factory line, ready to be sealed. represents packaging companie\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/zedspider\n\nInvestors have been waiting for a turnaround to happen for the world\u2019s largest food and beverage packaging expert Amcor (NYSE:AMCR). Like office REITs and many other stocks, Amcor was hurt by the one-two punch of inflation and high interest rates. Its stock has been essentially flat over the past year and until only recently was heavily in the red.\n\nOver the past month, however, AMCR stock jumped 10% after reporting fiscal third-quarter earnings. Although the packaging company missed analysts sales estimates, profits of 17.8 cents per share handily beat expectations.\n\nAs the biggest player with more than twice the market share of its nearest competitor, Amcor can benefit from economies of scale on input costs, primarily resins, than its competitors. Moreover, it signs long-term contracts (about seven years) when its plants are located near customers as it reduces transportation costs. The average contract is typically for two to three years. It is also investing more in higher margin segments such as pet food and medical products. As Amcor\u2019s lower value contracts expire, it can raise prices or trade up to higher value ones.\n\nGrowth won\u2019t ever be explosive, even in the emerging markets it services, but it will be steady, providing a foundation for its dividend that yields 5.1% annually.\n\nHigh-Yield Dividend Aristocrat No. 3: AbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nPharmaceutical giant AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) got a backdoor entrance into the Dividend Aristocrat list. After being spun off from parent Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) in 2013 it inherited its former parent\u2019s dividend payment history. Yet over the past decade, AbbVie has steadily raised its dividend by a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14%. FCF has grown at a similar rate, ensuring the continued payout of the dividend, which yields 3.7% a year.\n\nThere was a lot of concern about its primary therapy Humira losing patent protection and having to face biosimilar competition. However, the drug continues to pull in billions of dollars in revenue and it has a full portfolio of other billion-dollar therapies. It turns out there was a lot of concern over nothing. Shares of the pharmaceutical are up 9% year-to-date and 27% over the past year.\n\nIn addition to its own portfolio of drugs, AbbVie has been on a spending spree, buying up other promising drugs. It just acquired Celsius Therapeutics for $250 million for its CEL383 to treat inflammatory bowel disease. It has successfully completed Phase 1 trials though results haven\u2019t been published. This year it also acquired Landos Biopharma, ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics.\n\nKimberly-Clark (KMB) Kimberly Clark (KMB) sign, positioned outside the world headquarters\u2019 main entrance.\n\nSource: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.com\n\nConsumer products leader Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) is on a roll this year with shares up 15% in 2024 as it rebounds from inflation-impacted results. Yet because it owns a portfolio of billion-dollar name brands itself, including Kleenex, Huggies and Scott that hold the No. 1 or No. 2 share positions in some 80 countries, it was able to mitigate the damage.\n\nThe value of owning such well-known brands is consumers understand the quality and consistency of the products they are buying. And since the merchandise is a consumable, shoppers return to the store again and again to buy more.\n\nHigh inflation does cause consumers to trade down to lower-priced products. When it eases, though, they will often return to their previous habits. There is more good news for Kimberly-Clark on the inflation front too. The Commerce Dept. just reported inflation was flat in May from the previous month. Inflation was still up 2.6% from the year-ago period.\n\nWith prices moving in the right direction, the Federal Reserve may be more inclined to cut interest rates than the bank presidents previously expressed.\n\nEven so, KMB\u2019s dividend is not in any danger. Although it has increased its payout over the past decade at just 3.8%, the dividend payout ratio of 57% still means the dividend is safe.\n\nHigh-Yield Dividend Aristocrat No. 5: Kenvue (KVUE) Mobile phone with logo of American consumer health products company Kenvue Inc. (KVUE) in front of website. Focus on center-left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nKenvue (NYSE:KVUE) is one of the newest additions to the Divident Aristocrat list. It was spun off by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) last year as the pharmaceutical giant wanted to focus more acutely on healthcare. Kenvue is the world\u2019s largest pure-play consumer health company by revenue. It owns some of the best well-established, world-renown brands like Tylenol, Band-Aid, Listerine and Johnson\u2019s.\n\nLike AbbVie, it is considered dividend royalty by virtue of its former parent\u2019s dividend history. Its payout of 80 cents per share yields 4.3% annually. And despite not having a track record yet of its own to run on, CEO Thibaut Mongon has said the dividend is \u201can important component of our disciplined capital allocation strategy and our plan to deliver sustained value creation for all of our stockholders.\u201d\n\nThat should provide sufficient comfort to investors that Kenvue intends to continue the dividend practices established under Johnson & Johnson.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) ko stock coca cola life\n\nSource: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is the beverage king for good reason. The \u201cwave\u201d logo is an iconic symbol of the company around the world. Soda continues to generate billions of dollars in revenue for Coke despite the secular decline in consumption.\n\nPrecisely because of changing consumer tastes, Coca-Cola has undergone a transformation. It is no longer just a carbonated beverages business but also possesses some of the best still beverage brands. From Dasani water and protein-enhance Fairlife milk to Gold Peak tea and Minute Maid juice, Coke holds preeminent positions in the beverage aisle.\n\nThat is supported by an unparalleled distribution network. Any new product offering can command premium shelf space in grocery and convenience stores.\n\nCoca-Cola has a 57-year history of raising its dividend,which yields 3% annually. The beverage stock has grown the payout at 4.8% CAGR for the past decade. It also announced a new increase earlier this year of 5.4%.\n\nHigh-Yield Dividend Aristocrat No. 7: Chevron (CVX) Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper building\n\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe second-largest integrated oil and gas giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is the seventh Dividend Aristocrat that should put investors in dividend heaven. The company is just one of a handful of oil and gas stocks that didn\u2019t suspend or cut its dividend during the pandemic. Despite oil trading at -$37 a barrel at one point, meaning no one wanted to take or hold oil with the economy locked down, it relied upon its immense profit-generating capabilities to see it through the turmoil.\n\nFortunately, Chevron can remain profitable while supporting its dividend even if the price of a barrel of Brent crude falls to $50. Brent oil is the international benchmark and it currently trades north of $87 a barrel. Chevron says it can more than double its FCF by 2027. As it has grown its cash profits by 6% annually for the past five years it is probable it can do so as the oil giant invests in its business, makes acquisitions and reduces its operating costs.\n\nChevron\u2019s dividend of $6.52 per share is yielding 4.1% at current prices.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in O, KMB, AMCR, ABBV, KO, JNJ, CVX, MMM and WBA stock.

        "content": "Blue-chip stocks continue to trail in this market. Through the first half of the year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is comprised of 30 blue-chip stocks, is up 4% compared to a 20% gain in the technology loaded Nasdaq Composite index. Technology stocks, particularly the mega-cap names, continue to outperform at the expense of blue-chips.\n\nThere are many rock-solid blue-chip stocks that have delivered strong financial results, trade at cheap valuations, and are worthy of investor capital, but not every blue-chip stock. Some well-known companies are seeing their share prices trade at 52-week lows for good reason. Poor earnings, lowered guidance, and a loss of market share are seeing some blue-chip names plunge, and deservedly so.\n\nHere are three blue-chip stocks to sell in July before they crash and burn.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNike (NKE) Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocks\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnyone still holding onto shares of Nike (NYSE:NKE) might want to reconsider their position. The company\u2019s stock just plunged 20% in one trading session after the sneaker and athletic apparel retailer posted poor quarterly financial results and lowered its full-year guidance. Nike stock is down 34% in the last 12 months and trading at a 52-week low, with no hope of recovery in sight.\n\nThe company reported EPS of $1.01 versus the 83 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue for the company\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter totaled $12.61 billion compared to $12.84 billion that was forecast and sales were down 2% from a year earlier. For all of fiscal 2024, Nike posted sales of $51.36 billion, which were flat compared to the previous year and the slowest pace of annual sales growth since 2010. Worse, Nike lowered its forward guidance.\n\nThe company said it expects sales to drop 10% for the just completed second quarter of the calendar year due to soft sales in China and what executives called \u201cuneven consumer trends.\u201d Nike previously expected sales to grow in its fiscal 2025 year. Sales in North America, Nike\u2019s biggest market, came in at $5.28 billion in the just completed quarter, below forecasts of $5.45 billion. This bad news makes Nike a blue-chip stock to sell.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe only company that had a worse earnings print than Nike recently is Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). The retail pharmacy chain\u2019s stock fell 24% in a week after management delivered mixed financial results and lowered their forward guidance. Walgreens reported EPS of 63 cents, which missed consensus expectations that called for 68 cents. Revenue totaled $36.40 billion, which was ahead of forecasts of $35.94 billion. Sales increased 2.6% from the same period a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat really sunk Walgreens was its guidance. Company executives said they now expect full-year 2024 earnings of $2.80 to $2.95 per share. That new guidance is down from a previous outlook that called for earnings of $3.20 to $3.35 a share. Executives at the company said the lowered guidance reflects a \u201cchallenging environment\u201d for pharmacies and consumers. Walgreens declined to provide a new revenue forecast for the fiscal year.\n\nThe latest disappointing print comes as Walgreens cuts costs amid weakening consumer demand. The company is in the midst of turnaround strategy that is focused on closing underperforming stores. In the last 12 months, this blue-chip stock to sell has declined 57% and is also near a 52-week low.\n\nLevi Strauss & Co. (LEVI) a stack of white t-shirts with the Levi's (LEVI) logo on them\n\nSource: Papin Lab / Shutterstock.com\n\nDemin, specifically blue jeans, are the hot fashion trend of 2024. Denim jeans, jackets, dresses and skirts are making a comeback with consumers and trending on social media. Influencers are peddling denim products all over the internet. Ironically, Levi Strauss & Co. (NYSE:LEVI) is not benefitting from the denim craze. The company, which is widely credited with inventing blue jeans back in 1853, has not enjoyed a sales uptick.\n\nIn fact, Levi just delivered a stinker of a quarter that sent its share price down 15% in a day. LEVI stock is now trading nearly 10% lower than where it was five years ago. This comes after the denim retailer reported EPS of 16 cents versus 11 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $1.44 billion compared to $1.45 billion that was anticipated. The company blamed the miss on foreign exchange rates and weak sales of its Docker\u2019s brand.\n\nOn a call with analysts and media, management reaffirmed their previous full-year guidance, which calls for earnings of $1.17 to $1.27 per share. That\u2019s in line with Wall Street targets. Unfortunately, investors weren\u2019t in a forgiving mood, making Levi Strauss a blue-chip stock to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer and Walgreens Boots Alliance have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 2, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Super Micro Computer SMCI as the Bull of the Day and Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Baker Hughes Co. BKR, Diamondback Energy, Inc. FANG and Matador Resources Co. MTDR.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nSuper Micro Computer is the premier provider of advanced Server Building Block Solutions for 5G/Edge, Data Center, Cloud, Enterprise, Big Data, HPC, and Embedded markets worldwide. The company's earnings outlook remains bullish across the board, pushing it into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nIn addition to favorable earnings estimate revisions, the stock resides in the Zacks Computer \u2013 Storage Devices industry, currently ranked in the top 18% of all Zacks industries. Let's take a closer look at how the company currently stacks up.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Posts Robust Quarterly Results\n\nSuper Micro shares have been in a league of their own in 2024, gaining nearly 190% and crushing the S&P 500's also impressive 16% gain. Share performance has been aided by robust quarterly results, with the company posting 360% year-over-year EPS growth on 200% higher sales in its latest print.\n\nSMCI's top line has shown a notable acceleration over the last few periods, as we can see illustrated below. Sales growth is forecasted to remain robust, with the $14.9 billion Zacks Consensus Sales estimate for its current fiscal year suggesting a 110% climb year-over-year.\n\nCharles Liang, CEO of Supermicro, was positive on the latest set of results, stating, \"Strong demand for AI rack scale PnP solutions, along with our team's ability to develop innovative DLC designs, enabled us to expand our market leadership in AI infrastructure. As new solutions ramp, including fully production ready DLC, we expect to continue gaining market share. As such, we are raising our fiscal year 2024 revenue outlook from $14.3 to $14.7 billion to a new range of $14.7 to $15.1 billion.\"\n\nRevenue expectations moved accordingly following the release, up a staggering 94% overall over the last year.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank \u2013 one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.\n\nThe top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.\n\nSuper Micro Computer would be an excellent stock for investors to consider, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance is a retail drugstore chain that sells prescription and non-prescription drugs. The company also sells general merchandise products, including household items, convenience and fresh foods, personal care, beauty care, photofinishing, and candy.\n\nAnalysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's outlook, landing the stock into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nIn addition, the company is in the Zacks Retail \u2013 Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, which is currently ranked in the bottom 1% of all Zacks industries.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the company.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance\n\nWBA shares have faced consistent pressure year-to-date, down more than 50% and widely underperforming. A recent set of weak quarterly results caused a post-earnings share plunge, with the company falling short of EPS expectations but delivering a modest sales beat.\n\nWBA lowered its outlook following the release, explaining the knee-jerk reaction that followed.\n\nCEO Tim Wentworth acknowledged the weaker-than-expected results, stating, \"We continue to face a difficult operating environment, including persistent pressures on the U.S. consumer and the impact of recent marketplace dynamics which have eroded pharmacy margins. Our results and outlook reflect these headwinds, despite solid performance in both our International and U.S. Healthcare segments.\"\n\nShares yield 8.3% annually now following the steep decline, though it's critical to note that investors should remain on the sidelines until the company's earnings picture shifts positively and it provides further guidance on its strategic initiatives.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMargin pressures and lowered guidance paint a challenging picture for the company's shares in the near term.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's earnings outlook.\n\nFor those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) \u2013 these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nTotal U.S. Drilling Rig Tally Falls: Here's What It Means\n\nIn its weekly release,\u00a0Baker Hughes Co. stated that the U.S. rig count was lower than the prior week's figure. The rotary rig count, issued by BKR, is usually published in major newspapers and trade publications.\n\nBaker Hughes' data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry. The number of active rigs and its comparison with the week-ago figure indicates the demand trajectory for the company's oilfield services from exploration and production companies.\n\nRig Count Data in Detail\n\nTotal U.S. Rig Count Falls: The number of rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States was 581 in the week ended Jun 28, lower than the week-ago count of 588. The current national rig count also declined from the year-ago level of 674, reflecting the fact that there has been a slowdown in drilling activities. Some analysts see this downside as a sign of increased efficiency among shale producers, who may need fewer rigs. However, there are doubts among a few about whether certain producers have sufficient promising land for drilling.\n\nOnshore rigs in the week that ended on Jun 28 totaled 560, lower than the prior week's count of 567. In offshore resources, 21 rigs were operating, which was flat with the week-ago count.\n\nU.S. Oil Rig Count Declines: The oil rig count was 479 in the week ended Jun 28, lower than the week-ago figure of 485. The current number of oil rigs \u2014 far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014 \u2014 was also down from the year-ago figure of 545.\n\nU.S. Natural Gas Rig Count Falls: The natural gas rig count of 97 was lower than the week-ago figure of 98. The count of rigs exploring the commodity was also below the year-ago week's tally of 124. Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is almost 94% lower than the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008.\n\nRig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 18 units, lower than the week-ago count of 19. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) of 563 was down from the prior-week level of 569.\n\nRig Count in the Most Prolific Basin\n\nPermian \u2014 the most prolific basin in the United States \u2014 recorded a weekly oil and gas rig count of 305, which was lower than the week-ago figure of 308. The count is also below the prior-year level of 341.\n\nOutlook\n\nThe West Texas Intermediate crude price is trading at more than the $80-per-barrel mark, highly favorable for exploration and production operations. Although the commodity pricing scenario is handsome, there has been a slowdown in drilling activities, which may continue as upstream players are prioritizing stockholder returns rather than boosting output.\n\nAmid the backdrop, investors seeking medium to long-term gains may keep an eye on energy stocks like Diamondback Energy, Inc. and Matador Resources Co..\n\nDiamondback Energy, a leading pure-play Permian operator, reported ongoing enhancements in the average productivity per well in the Midland Basin. The exploration and production company expects to maintain growth in production volumes, benefiting from favorable commodity pricing conditions. FANG, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), also has an investment-grade balance sheet. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nMatador Resources recently entered into a $1.91 billion agreement to expand its footprint in the prolific Delaware Basin. With the deal expected to close in the late third quarter of 2024, the #3 Ranked company is projected to have more than 190,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin on a pro forma basis. Consequently, the company estimates that its production will exceed 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, positioning it for significant growth and enhanced operational scale.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA is a retail drugstore chain that sells prescription and non-prescription drugs. The company also sells general merchandise products, including household items, convenience and fresh foods, personal care, beauty care, photofinishing, and candy.\n\nAnalysts have taken a bearish stance on the company\u2019s outlook, landing the stock into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn addition, the company is in the Zacks Retail \u2013 Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, which is currently ranked in the bottom 1% of all Zacks industries.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the company.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance\n\nWBA shares have faced consistent pressure year-to-date, down more than 50% and widely underperforming. A recent set of weak quarterly results caused a post-earnings share plunge, with the company falling short of EPS expectations but delivering a modest sales beat. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWBA lowered its outlook following the release, explaining the knee-jerk reaction that followed.\n\nCEO Tim Wentworth acknowledged the weaker-than-expected results, stating, \"We continue to face a difficult operating environment, including persistent pressures on the U.S. consumer and the impact of recent marketplace dynamics which have eroded pharmacy margins. Our results and outlook reflect these headwinds, despite solid performance in both our International and U.S. Healthcare segments.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s margin pressures are illustrated further below. Please note that the chart is on a trailing twelve-month basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares yield 8.3% annually now following the steep decline, though it's critical to note that investors should remain on the sidelines until the company\u2019s earnings picture shifts positively and it provides further guidance on its strategic initiatives.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMargin pressures and lowered guidance paint a challenging picture for the company\u2019s shares in the near term.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance WBA is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company\u2019s earnings outlook.\n\nFor those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) \u2013 these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Overhyped Stocks to Sell in July Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "It will be tough for the stock market to keep up the pace after such an explosive first half. Undoubtedly, stocks could easily continue to rise if demand for artificial intelligence accelerates further. In any case, it\u2019s far smarter to lower expectations by a notch, especially with valuations getting a tad ahead of their skis.\n\nWhile not all stocks are pricier than when the year began, I think certain names stand out as more ripe for profit-taking than others. In this piece, we\u2019ll have a glimpse of three overhyped stocks to sell that may be in for rougher waters in the second half.\n\nWhether they\u2019re more vulnerable to amplified downside in the face of the next market crash or correction remains to be seen. Either way, I find there to be a lack of value in the following names.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) An image of a Tesla EV charger\n\nAfter running into several road bumps in the first half, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares may be viewed by some as more of a prime buy-the-dip candidate. It is still a Magnificent Seven company, after all, and one that could have room to run if it\u2019s to catch up to its six better-performing rivals.\n\nAt the time of writing, TSLA stock was down just over 20% in the first half. With a much-hyped robotaxi event in store for August, the electric vehicle (EV) maker may have the catalyst it needs to make it magnificent again.\n\nDespite the relatively modest multiple \u2014 54.1 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) \u2014 Tesla and the other autos could roll further downhill from here as hopes for a delivery recovery fade. Some analysts see Tesla coming up short on deliveries for the second quarter. If Elon Musk and his company fail to stack up to expectations, it\u2019s hard to envision TSLA stock turning higher in the second half.\n\nLululemon (LULU) A close-up picture of the Lululemon (LULU) sign in the Hong Kong airport.\n\nSource: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com\n\nLululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) also had a painful start to the year, with LULU stock shedding more than 40% of its value in the first half. The woes may not be over yet as the company attempts to find its footing in a fashion scene that\u2019s seeing denim making a comeback of sorts. Jeans seem to be in, while athleisure and yoga pants are out.\n\nThe latest quarterly earnings report, which saw sales rise 10% and a higher guide, provided some relief for investors, at least initially. With LULU stock now stretching lower to kick off the second half; however, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m all too enthused to chase the name as a value play. Especially not while consumers look away from various upscale apparel brands.\n\nThough shares look historically cheap at 24 times trailing P/E, I find it tough for Lululemon to stay relevant in the face of rising competitive threats. Management seems to be pointing the finger at themselves for the recent underperformance, noting \u201cmissed opportunities.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, I think the worst of Lululemon\u2019s woes are mostly out of its control. The apparel scene, as a whole, is just in such a bad spot right now. And it could stay this way for a while.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of laggards, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) finished off the first half with a catastrophic implosion. Now down close to 25% in the past week and over 54% for the first half, questions linger as to what the free-falling U.S. pharmacy retailer will do as it shutters a sizeable chunk of its stores.\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s no easy solution for Walgreens, which also trimmed its guidance for the full year, now calling for earnings per share to be in the $2.80 to 2.95 range, down from $3.20 to 3.35. That\u2019s a steep cut and one that\u2019s adding salt to the wounds of an already distressed firm.\n\nManagement\u2019s commentary did not do much to soothe WBA stockholders\u2019 fears, either. CEO Tim Wentworth stated that the \u201ccurrent pharmacy model is not sustainable.\u201d With big changes ahead and significant earnings headwinds on the horizon, WBA stock seems like too risky a stock to buy no matter how much cheaper it gets.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Walgreens Boots (WBA) Q3 Earnings Miss, Gross Margin Down",
        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. WBA delivered adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 63 cents in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, down 37% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure (same at constant exchange rate or CER). The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.97%.\n\nGAAP earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were 40 cents per share compared with the year-ago quarter\u2019s earnings of 14 cents.\n\nTotal Sales\n\nWalgreens Boots recorded total sales of $36.35 billion in the fiscal third quarter, up 2.6% year over year and 2.5% at CER. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.07%.\n\nQuarterly Details\n\nThe company currently operates its business through three reportable segments \u2014 U.S. Retail Pharmacy, International and U.S. Healthcare.\n\nU.S. Retail Pharmacy\n\nThe segment\u2019s sales increased 2.3% year over year to $28.5 billion in the fiscal third quarter, driven entirely by comparable pharmacy sales, partly offset by a retail decline. Comparable sales jumped 3.5% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s levels, driven by brand inflation and pharmacy and prescription volume, however partially offset by a drop in retail sales.\n\nPharmacy sales were up 4.4% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figures, and comparable pharmacy sales increased 5.7%, benefiting from higher branded drug inflation and script growth.\n\nRetail sales fell 4%, and comparable retail sales were down 2.3% year over year, reflecting a challenging retail environment and a continued channel shift.\n\nInternational\n\nRevenues in the International division rose 2.8% on a year-over-year basis and increased 1.6% at CER to $5.7 billion in the fiscal third quarter.\n\nBoots UK sales rose 1.6% year over year. In Germany, wholesale business sales increased 4.9% in the fiscal third quarter.\n\nBoots UK\u2019s comparable retail sales advanced 6%. Further, Boots UK\u2019s comparable pharmacy sales rose 5.8% year over year.\n\nU.S. Healthcare\n\nU.S. Healthcare reported fiscal third-quarter revenues of $2.1 billion. The metric was up 7.6% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s levels, led by VillageMD and Shields.\n\nWithin the segment, the Shields business rose 24%, driven by the growth within existing partnerships. VillageMD jumped 7%, reflecting additional lives in risk and fee-for-service.\n\nMargins\n\nThe gross profit in the reported quarter fell 1.9% year over year to $6.46 billion. The gross margin contracted 84 bps to 17.8%.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses fell 10.3% year over year to $6.39 billion.\n\nThe company reported an adjusted operating profit of $66 million for the quarter against the operating loss of $534 million in the year-ago period.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancial Condition\n\nWalgreens Boots exited the third quarter of fiscal 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of $703 million compared with $739 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The total debt was $8.91 billion compared with $9.06 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nThe cumulative cash used by operating activities at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $314 million compared with the year-ago period\u2019s cash inflow of $1.22 billion.\n\nFiscal 2024 Guidance\n\nThe company revised its outlook for fiscal 2024.\n\nAdjusted EPS guidance is now expected in the band of $2.80-$2.95 (earlier $3.20-$3.35) range. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.06.\n\nOur Take\n\nWalgreens Boots missed the consensus mark for earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, while revenues were better than expected.\u00a0 The bottom line was pressured by the difficulties in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy business, reflecting the challenging consumer environment and pharmacy industry trends. Branded mix impacts, and increased regulatory and reimbursement pressures, including fluctuations in NADAC pricing, have hurt the pricing dynamics.\n\nAdditionally, the script market growth is not yet back to the pre-pandemic levels, which affected WBA\u2019s performance and profitability. The company anticipates the tough operating conditions to persist for the remainder of the year, resulting in a reduced EPS forecast for fiscal 2024. The contraction of the gross margin is also discouraging for the stock.\n\nOn a positive note, both the U.S. Healthcare and International segments met the company's expectations. Walgreens Boots continues to manage costs efficiently and is set to deliver $1 billion in cost savings this year. Following the actions previously undertaken to right-size VillageMD's footprint, the business is now moving toward profitability by adding more patients and optimizing its cost structure.\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nWalgreens Boots currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are Hims & Hers Health HIMS, DaVita DVA and ResMed RMD.\n\nHims & Hers Health, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reported first-quarter 2024 earnings of 5 cents per share, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a remarkable 150%.

Despite a lower yield of 3.6%, the company's payout ratio of 49.9% suggests dividends are well-covered by earnings, contrasting positively against firms with unsustainable high payout ratios.

        "content": "The boss of UK high street health and beauty chain Boots has announced plans to stand down after six years in the top job.\n\nManaging director Sebastian James has handed in his notice to take up a role in the healthcare sector.\n\nBoots, which is owned by US-listed giant Walgreens Boots Alliance, said Mr James will remain with the group until November.\n\nThe firm has kicked off the process to find his successor.\n\nIt is thought Mr James is leaving to take on a role at a European eye surgery business.\n\nHe has been in the top job at Boots in the UK since 2018, having previously headed up the electricals retailer Dixons, which has since been renamed Currys.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDuring his time at Boots, he has overseen 13 consecutive quarters of market share growth, according to the firm.\n\nBut his decision to quit comes amid reports that Walgreens has once again put plans on ice to sell or float the Boots chain.\n\nMr James said: \u201cIt has been a pleasure to lead this fantastic company and support its transformation during my time as managing director.\n\n\u201cNow in its 175th year, Boots has shaped how people access health and beauty products on the high street and I am proud to have been part of a business that continues to hold a critical role at the centre of the UK health and beauty sectors.\u201d\n\nOrnella Barra, international chief operating officer at Walgreens Boots Alliance, said: \u201cWe thank Sebastian for his commitment \u2013 together with the Boots leadership team \u2013 to delivering a strong platform for success and sustainable, long-term growth, and wish him all the best for his next endeavour.\u201d\n\nBoots recently revealed a jump in sales for the latest quarter, but its parent firm cut profit forecasts and announced US store closures.\n\nBoots posted a 6% rise in UK comparable retail sales over the quarter to the end of May, with in-store sales higher on the back of stronger footfall in its travel, beauty and flagship shops.\n\nHowever, total sales growth slowed to 1.6% as it was impacted by store closures over the past year, having shut around 300 shops to take its store estate down to 1,900 sites.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts owner Walgreens said in the results that it planned to shut more of its underperforming US shops following a strategic review.\n\nWBA also cuts its earning per share guidance for the financial year to August, amid a \u201cchallenging US retail environment\u201d.\n\nOverall group sales were 2.6% higher at 36.4 billion dollars (\u00a328.8 billion) for the quarter to May, as its US business saw stronger pharmacy sales offset a retail slump.",

        "title": "Nike and Walgreens Boot Alliance are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 1, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Nike NKE and Walgreens Boot Alliance WBA.\n\nQ2 Earnings Growth Forecasted to Hit 2-Year High\n\nNike and Walgreens Boot Alliance became the latest S&P 500 members to release quarterly results for their respective fiscal quarters ending in May. Including these two bellwether operators, we now have May-quarter results from 18 S&P 500 members. We and other research organizations engaged in tracking earnings results in real time count such May-quarter results as part of the overall June-quarter or Q2 tally.\n\nIn other words, by the time everyone starts paying attention to the Q2 earnings season with the quarterly reports from the big banks, beginning on July 12th, we will have such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members.\n\nRegular readers of our earnings commentary are familiar with our sanguine view of corporate profitability. The growth picture has been steadily improving over the last few quarters, and even the revisions trend has notably stabilized lately.\n\nThe 'doom & gloom view' of corporate profitability that a noisy market segment appeared to subscribe to last year has primarily moved to the fringes. Driving this evolution has been the U.S. economy's resilient performance in the face of the Fed's extraordinary tightening. With the Fed now gearing up to start easing policy in the coming months, many of the dire risks to the economy and corporate earnings have eased significantly.\n\nThis is the macro backdrop in which we digested the Q1 earnings season and the one we will be receiving the Q2 earnings results in soon.\n\nThe current expectation is that Q2 earnings for the S&P index will be up +8.3% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues.\n\nThis is the highest quarterly earnings growth pace since the +9.9% growth in the first quarter of 2022 and would follow the +6.7% earnings growth on +3.2% revenue gains in 2024 Q1.\n\nAs we have consistently flagged in our commentaries, the revisions trend for 2024 Q2 and full-year 2024 has been very favorable lately.\n\nQ2 estimates went up after the period got underway and have started coming down only in recent weeks. This is a far better revisions trend relative to what we have been used to seeing ahead of the start of other recent quarterly reporting cycles.\n\nThe improving earnings outlook for the Energy sector has been a major contributor to this favorable revisions trend at the index level. But the Energy sector isn't the only sector that has enjoyed positive estimate revisions since the start of April. Other sectors enjoying positive estimate revisions include Transportation, Utilities, Tech, and Autos. On the negative side, estimates have been cut for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the notable declines at the Industrial Products, Aerospace, Consumer Staples, Conglomerates, Construction, and others.\n\nStory continues\n\nEmbedded in current Q2 earnings and revenue estimates is a steady improvement in margins, continuing the positive trend that has been in place since 2023 Q3. The extreme margin pressure that we witnessed in 2022 and the first half of 2023 is now behind us.\n\nFor 2024 Q2, net margins are expected to be above the year-earlier level for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest gains at Tech, Medical, Finance, Consumer Discretionary, and others. On the negative side, margins are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with major pressure at Basic Materials, Autos, Transportation, and other sectors.\n\nThe Tech sector has been a major contributor to the index growth in recent quarters, and that trend is expected to remain in place in 2024 Q2 as well. Total earnings for the sector are expected to be up +15.5% on +9.5% higher revenues with a 119-basis point expansion in net margins.\n\nThe period of easy comparisons is coming to an end, but the overall margins outlook is still favorable for the space.\n\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9% on +1.7% revenue growth. The expected revenue growth pace improves to +3.9% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index-level aggregate earnings growth for the year remaining unchanged at +9% on an ex-Finance basis.\n\nQ2 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nAs noted earlier, the recent earnings reports from Nike, Walgreens and 16 other S&P 500 members for their respective fiscal quarters ending in May get counted as part of our official 2024 Q2 earnings tally. This week, we are a bit light on the reporting front, with about six companies reporting results, including S&P 500 member Constellation Brands.\n\nFor the 18 S&P 500 members that have reported their fiscal May quarter results already, total earnings are up +25.8% from the same period last year on +4.4% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and only 38.9% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q2 Earnings Loom: What to Expect?\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "content": "I\u2019ve long been a proponent of blue-chip stocks as reliable anchors in an investment portfolio. But you can\u2019t buy them blindly. While there are outstanding blue-chip stocks out there, there\u2019s the other side of the coin \u2013 F-rated blue-chip stocks that will do serious damage unless you properly identify them as stocks to sell.\n\nBlue-chip stocks represent names you already know \u2013 some of the most well-established and financially sound companies on the market. Blue chips are recognized leaders in their fields, sport large market capitalizations and usually offer enticing dividend payments.\n\nUsing the Portfolio Grader, you can quickly identify which blue-chip names are underperforming the market. And you can even find some names doing so badly with earnings, revenue growth, momentum and analyst sentiment that they get a dreaded \u201cF\u201d rating.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf you own an F-rated blue-chip stock, you are leaving money on the table that could be better utilized in more promising opportunities. Holding on comes with a lot of risk because a turnaround is not guaranteed, and if it comes at all, it could take a long time. Your money is better spent with highly rated stocks that will help you along your investing journey.\n\nThese are some F-rated stocks to sell now. It\u2019s not too late to divest from these underperforming blue chips and move your money to more promising opportunities.\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) Close up of UPS logo printed on a delivery truck.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) is one of the biggest shipping companies in the world, operating in over 220 countries and territories. Founded more than 100 years ago, in 1907, it offers transportation, distribution, trade and brokerage services.\n\nBut time has not been kind to UPS, particularly recently. The company is battling declining delivery volume and higher labor costs, thanks in part to a new contract it signed with union workers last year.\n\nThose factors helped lead to a sagging stock price and a disappointing earnings report in the first quarter. Revenue of $21.7 billion was down from $22.9 billion a year ago.\n\nThere were problems in both the U.S. and the company\u2019s international segment. In the U.S., profits fell to $839 million, from $1.48 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Revenue in the U.S. fell by 5%, and the average daily volume fell by 3.2%.\n\nIn the company\u2019s international segment, revenue fell by 6.3% and the average daily volume was down by 5.8%. Operating profit for the international segment dropped from $806 million a year ago to $682 million in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWarren Buffett sold his $10 million stake in UPS late last year and that looks to be a good decision. UPS is down 13% this year and gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is a retail pharmacy chain that operates over 8,000 locations in the U.S. and over 3,000 in Europe and Latin America.\n\nBut the company is in deep trouble as spiraling costs and reduced margins \u2013 particularly with generic drugs whose prices are strongly influenced by pharmacy benefits managers \u2013 have taken a massive toll on WBA profits.\n\n\u2033We assumed \u2026 in the second half that the consumer would get somewhat stronger\u201d but \u201cthat is not the case,\u201d Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth said in an interview with CNBC. \u201c[T]he consumer is absolutely stunned by the absolute prices of things, and the fact that some of them may not be inflating doesn\u2019t actually change their resistance to the current pricing. So we\u2019ve had to get really keen, particularly in discretionary things.\u201d\n\nThe company cut its earnings guidance for the rest of the fiscal year from a range of $3.20 to $3.35 to a range of $2.80 to $2.95. It said it would close underperforming stores, although management didn\u2019t say how many that would include. Wentworth told analysts that 100% of the company\u2019s profitability comes from 75% of the company\u2019s stores.\n\nWBA stock is down 53% this year, including a massive 22% drop when the company dropped its full-year guidance. The stock gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) A close-up of the blue and yellow Warner Bros (WBD) sign.\n\nSource: Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) is a media an entertainment company formed by Warner Bros.\u2019 spinoff from AT&T (NYSE:T) in 2022 and its merger with Discovery.\n\nThe company has several massive properties, including the Warner Bros. film studios, Cable News Network CNN, the Cartoon Network, cable station TBS, and the streaming platform Max.\n\nBut the spinoff hasn\u2019t been a success, having lost 70% of its value since launch. And that continued this year, as revenues in the first quarter were down 7% from a year ago to $9.95 billion. The company reported a net loss for the quarter of $966 million.\n\nThe good news is that the company could repay $1.1 billion in debt in the first quarter. But I don\u2019t expect this company to turn around until it can figure out a way to pay the rest of its debt and start putting more money into growing the business again.\n\nWBD stock is down 35% this year and gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAmerican Airlines (AAL) An American Airlines (AAL) airplane waiting on the tarmac. Represents airline stocks.\n\nSource: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is one of the biggest airlines in the world, operating nearly 6,700 flights per day to more than 300 destinations.\n\nBut there\u2019s trouble in the air for AAL stock. While this summer is expected to be a big travel season, American Airlines lowered its guidance on May 28, saying it expects second quarter adjusted earnings to be in a range from $1 to $1.15 per share, down from a range of $1.15 and $1.45 per share.\n\nIn addition, the company said its total revenue per available seat mile will drop by 5% to 6%, instead of the 1% to 2% that the company first forecast.\n\nAll this comes as the airline announced the departure of Chief Commercial Officer Vasu Raja, who launched an initiative he called \u201cmodern retailing\u201d to encourage customers to book flights on the company website or app rather than using booking sites and travel agents.

While revenue was up by 3% in the first quarter to $646.1 million, the company still posted a net loss of $81.9 million and a loss of 49 cents per share.\n\nThings won\u2019t improve in Q2, as the company issued guidance calling for revenue in the range of $635 million to $660 million and a net loss of 35 cents to 45 cents per share.\n\nThe company\u2019s weak stock performance prompted the ouster of longtime CEO Jason Gorevic, who was replaced by Chuck Divita, who was executive vice president of Guidewell.\n\nPerhaps Divita will have better luck making Teladoc profitable, but there\u2019s no need for investors to wait around as long as the company continues to issue guidance for losses.\n\nTDOC stock is down 53% this year and gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCeasars Entertainment (CZR) Caesar's Palace (CZR) in Las Vegas\n\nSource: Jason Patrick Ross/Shutterstock.com\n\nCeasars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) is a place for fun \u2013 the company offers hotels, upscale dining, dazzling shows and casino gaming.\n\nThe company has a major presence in Las Vegas has numerous gaming brands including Ceasars Palace, Harrah\u2019s, Horseshoe, Eldorado and Tropicana.\n\nCeasars now has more than 50 properties, having opened its first property in Nebraska last month, a Harrah\u2019s branded horse racetrack and casino.\n\nWhile it might be fun to visit a Ceasar property, however, holding Ceasars stock has been more of a gamble. The company saw revenue of $2.7 billion in the first quarter, down from $2.8 billion a year ago. Revenue from Las Vegas properties was down 4.5% for the quarter, and income from Las Vegas was down 30%.\n\nThe Las Vegas results were particularly surprising considering the quarter included what may be the biggest party of the year in Super Bowl LVIII, which was held in Las Vegas in February.

        "title": "Walgreens Stock Collapses on Weak Outlook. Is Now the Time to Buy?",
        "content": "Share prices of Walgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA) plunged following the June 27 release of its fiscal third-quarter earnings report, with the stock having one of its worst days on record. The stock price has now fallen more than 53% since the start of 2024.\n\nLet's look at Walgreens' most recent quarterly report, why the stock plummeted, and whether now is the time to buy.\n\nReduced guidance, store closures, and new plan\n\nFor its fiscal Q3 (ended in May), Walgreens saw its revenue rise 2.6% year over year to $36.4 billion. However, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) fell 36.5% to $0.63. U.S. retail pharmacy sales rose 2.3% year over year, with same-store sales up 3.5%. Comparable pharmacy sales were up 5.7%, while comparable retail sales were down 2.3%. Adjusted operating income plunged 47.9% year over year to $501 million, hurt by weak retail sales and pharmacy reimbursement pressures.\n\nInternational sales rose 2.8% year over year. Boots UK sales grew 1.6%, with retail same-store sales up 6% and pharmacy same-store sales up 5.8%. Adjusted operating income slid 15.8% year over year to $175 million.\n\nRevenue from its U.S. healthcare segment rose 7.6% year over year to $2.1 billion, with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $23 million, an improvement from negative $113 million a year ago. VillageMD revenue grew 7% year over year, while Shields revenue jumped 24%.\n\nGross margins fell to 17.8% from 18.6% a year ago. Gross margins in its U.S. retail pharmacy business fell to 17.7% from 19.1%. This shows how the company continues to get squeezed from pharmacy benefit managers over drug prices.\n\nWalgreens generated negative $314 million in operating cash flow through the first nine months of the year and negative $1.4 billion in free cash flow. It ended the quarter with $8.9 billion in debt and $703 million in cash.\n\nLooking ahead, the company reduced its fiscal full-year adjusted EPS outlook to $2.80 to $2.95 from a prior forecast of $3.20 to $3.35. Management expects the challenging consumer environment and muted script volume growth it is seeing to continue into 2025.\n\nAs a result, the company plans to close a \"significant portion\" of its 8,700 U.S. locations over the next three years, with it set to examine about 25% of its unprofitable locations. The company also said it will make investments to improve customer and patient experience, such as accelerating its digital and omnichannel offerings, building its loyalty program, and reducing the number of brands and SKUs on its shelves.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also plans to reduce its stake in VillageMD and no longer be its majority owner. However, it plans to keep its positions in Shields and Boots UK.\n\nThe company also remains in talks with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and health issuers about creating a better reimbursement system that will help stabilize its pharmacy margins and ensure fair payment. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs this dip an opportunity to buy the stock?\n\nReimbursement rate pressures that continue to hurt Walgreens' margins and lower profitably remain its biggest problem. Shifting to a cost-plus model, where it would get additional payments when it can help slow the inflationary costs on drug prices, would greatly benefit the company. It would also help relieve the constant drug reimbursement pressure it has seen year in and year out.\n\nHowever, while Walgreens is actively working with PBMs and other payers to change the model, this won't happen overnight. And the PBMs have clearly shown that they hold the upper hand.\n\nIn the meantime, it is a good idea to sell off some of its VillageMD stake, as this was a failed investment idea that stemmed from the company's previous management team. Closing unprofitable stores is also the right move. Walgreen's balance sheet is loaded with debt, so paying off debt and returning to positive free cash flow is a priority.\n\nTrading at about a 4 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Walgreens finds itself in the bargain bin. However, its debt load, lack of operating cash flow generation, and weakening operating performance are reasons the stock is trading at the current levels. WBA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nFor patient investors, Walgreens is worth taking a chance on at current levels. The stock is cheap, and the company's new CEO is now looking to make his imprint on the pharmacy giant. Given its valuation, if he can stabilize its pharmacy margins and improve its cash flow profile, the company has a lot of turnaround potential. However, a turnaround is going to take a while, and as such, it may take time for investors to be rewarded for their patience.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn\u2019t one of them.

Let\u2019s explore three top robotics stocks with the potential for notable returns.\n\nABB (ABBNY) ABB Robotics, Inc. training center in suburban Detroit.\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nTopping our list of robotics stocks is Switzerland-based ABB (OTCMKTS:ABBNY). The company operates in four main segments: electrification, robotics & discrete automation, motion, and process automation. Known for its innovative solutions like manufacturing robots, electric vehicle charging infrastructure and industrial motors, ABB continues to expand its market presence.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, ABB reported flat year-over-year (YOY) revenues of $7.87 billion, supported by strong contributions from its electrification segment. Despite a 5% YOY decline in order intake from the previous year\u2019s peak, totaling $9 billion, the company raised its profitability guidance for the full year 2024. Meanwhile, EPS dropped 12.5% to 49 cents.\n\nIn May, ABB bolstered its electrification portfolio by acquiring Siemens\u2018 (OTCMKTS:SIEGY) wiring accessories business in China aimed at enhancing regional customer offerings within smart buildings. ABB also launched the next-generation robotics control platform OmniCore to accelerate advanced automation. Furthermore, management invested $35 million in a new U.K. factory to expand manufacturing capabilities in Europe.\n\nDespite mixed earnings, ABBNY stock gained approximately 25% since January. The stock currently trades at 24.3 times forward earnings and 3.2 times sales. We believe investor enthusiasm for electrification and recovery in automation can support a bullish outlook in ABBNY stock. Therefore, interested readers can regard dips in ABB shares as an opportunity to hit the \u2018buy\u2019 button.\n\nStory continues\n\nCognex (CGNX) Cognex (CGNX) logo displayed on smartphone with pink and blue background behind, symbolizing CGNX stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rafapress\n\nNext on our list of robotics stocks is Cognex (NASDAQ:CGNX). The company offers machine vision products that help automate manufacturing and distribution tasks globally. Its product portfolio primarily includes vision software, vision sensors, vision systems and ID products.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Cognex reported financials that reflected a challenging, yet stable business environment. Revenue increased 5% YOY to $211 million driven by growth in logistics and semiconductors. However, adjusted EPS dropped 14% YOY to 11 cents while operating expenses increased by 5% from the previous year\u2019s quarter. Nonetheless, Cognex\u2019s financial position showed resilience with $557 million in cash and investments and no debt.\n\nIn April, Cognex unveiled the In-Sight L38, an AI-powered 3D vision system. This innovative technology combines 2D and 3D vision with AI capabilities, addressing diverse inspection and measurement tasks in manufacturing automation. I believe the increasing use of AI, machine learning and IoT in industrial applications bodes well for Cognex. Their products are integral to these advanced systems, positioning them to capitalize on these technological trends.\n\nCGNX stock has appreciated more than 11% YTD. Although shares are richly valued at 60 times forward earnings and 9.5 times trailing sales, analysts\u2019 12-month median forecast at $48.62 signals a 5% upside potential.\n\nZebra Technologies (ZBRA) A photo of the sign for Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) outside of a building.\n\nSource: Michael Vi/ShutterStock.com\n\nRounding out our discussion of robotics stocks, Zebra Technologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA) focuses on automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) solutions for enterprises. The company\u2019s core offerings include barcode printers and scanners, mobile computers and workflow optimization software. These tools enhance the efficiency of robotic systems in logistics and supply chain operations.\n\nInvestors noted that Zebra\u2019s first quarter 2024 earnings highlighted ongoing demand weakness across end markets. The company reported sales of $1.18 billion, marking a 16.8% decline YOY. EPS at $2.84 was a 28% decrease from the previous year.\n\nDespite headwinds, Zebra continues to strengthen its market position through strategic initiatives. It recently announced a collaboration with pharmacy retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), which is leveraging Zebra\u2019s Workcloud Actionable Intelligence software to optimize operational efficiency across 8,000 stores. This implementation yielded substantial savings and improved inventory management.\n\nIn addition, Zebra is innovating with new generative AI capabilities developed in partnership with several tech heavyweights including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). This collaboration aims to improve customer experiences and boost employee productivity.\n\nSo far in 2024, ZBRA stock is up nearly 13%. The shares are trading at 26.2 times forward earnings and 3.7 times sales. Wall Street maintains an optimistic outlook, setting a median 12-month price target of $348.25, a potential 13% upside from its current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

These stocks are industry heavyweights. They have experienced market difficulties lately but have much room to expand and recover. Those hoping to profit from cheap possibilities must comprehend the reasons behind these firms\u2019 recent difficulties and their plans to overcome them. A company on the list has demonstrated exceptional endurance in a challenging retail market and has had a considerable rise in revenue.\n\nSimilarly, another has positioned itself for future profitability in healthcare services. That\u00a0is by strategically concentrating on acquisitions and operational savings to offset revenue decreases. The last company on the list, however, has demonstrated its capacity to efficiently monetize its media assets by taking advantage of significant media events to generate significant growth in advertising income.\n\nOverall, the emphasis here is on the same principles that support these businesses\u2019 recovery strategies, explaining why the beaten-down stocks may be well-positioned for a revival.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe conglomerate Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is a global leader in retail pharmacy and healthcare services. Due to a challenging consumer environment, Walgreens reported disappointing earnings and lowered its full-year outlook, leading WBA stock to plummet over 20%.\n\nHowever, Walgreens reported a 2.6% revenue increase to\u00a0$36.4 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Hence, this expansion demonstrates Walgreens\u2019s capacity to successfully manage\u00a0challenging\u00a0retail settings and seize opportunities in its pharmacy and healthcare offerings.\n\nAdditionally, Walgreens\u2019 strategic moves in its pharmacy services have proven essential. The company\u2019s dedication to improving profitability and customer engagement is reflected in its focus on growing its brand penetration by 65 basis points. Programs that improve operational efficiency complete over 80% of orders in less than an hour, enhancing consumer convenience and satisfaction. These online purchases with in-store pickup and same-day delivery may increase sales.\n\nOverall, the company shows resilience through strategic expansions and sharp operations, making it a top mark on the beaten-down stocks list.\n\nCVS Health (CVS) Chevron (CVX) sing with \"diesel,\" \"food mart\" and \"car wash\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is a diversified healthcare services company. Strategic acquisitions such as Oak Street Health and Signify Health are anticipated to drive future expansion. With $29 billion in revenue, this category outperformed the previous year by 3% (Q1 2024). Higher prescription volumes and better medication purchase economics were the main drivers of the\u00a04% improvement\u00a0in adjusted operating income.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, the organization has integrated cost optimization activities throughout its operations to match expenses with business realities. That demonstrates a commitment to operational efficiency by utilizing business productivity programs and modifying workforce numbers to fit current volumes.\n\nFurther, despite the challenges, increasing margins across all its business sectors remain CVS Health\u2019s primary goal. For example, initiatives in the Health Care Benefits segment are being made to alleviate Medicare Advantage margin constraints by implementing modifications to benefit design and pricing for 2025. CVS Health focuses on innovation in pharmacy services via several initiatives. Hence, these include the launch of CVS CostVantage and the marketing of biosimilars\u00a0through Cordavis.\n\nIn summary, recent strategic acquisitions have placed it on the beaten-down stocks list, as it has the potential for growth by optimizing operations and expanding healthcare services.\n\nParamount (PARA) Paramount Global (PARA) - Analyst Downgrades\n\nParamount (NASDAQ:PARA) operates in the media and entertainment industry. The firm reported a 6% rise in overall revenue to $7.7 billion in Q1 2024. Strong results across all its business categories contributed to this gain, with the TV media sector contributing $5.2 billion. That was up 1% despite affiliate and subscription income difficulties, which fell by 3%. Nonetheless, Super Bowl LVIII added\u00a023 percentage points\u00a0to the growth rate. This\u00a0helped boost TV Media\u2019s advertising income, which increased by 14%. Hence, the result demonstrated how well Paramount monetizes its media assets and how\u00a0important\u00a0athletic events are for generating ad income.\n\nMoreover, in the Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) segment, Paramount attained a solid annual revenue growth of 24%. A\u00a0substantial 51% rise\u00a0in Paramount+ revenue drove a 22% increase in subscription revenue. The quarter saw the acquisition of 3.7 million new members, which increased the company\u2019s global streaming service subscriber base to 71.2 million. Additionally, advertising income at Paramount+ increased by a significant 31%.\n\nFinally, despite affiliate and subscription revenue challenges, Paramount\u2019s focus on strategic media monetization and subscriber growth positions it as a recovery candidate among beaten-down stocks.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in WBA, CVS and PARA.

        "title": "Walgreens plots bold comeback strategy, but the results will take time",
        "content": "Walgreens' (WBA) stock is down more than 50% this year as the company continues to face retail headwinds and pivots to a brand new strategy for the pharmacy chain.\n\nCEO Tim Wentworth, who has been on the job for eight months, laid out an aggressive plan to revamp the company on its third quarter earnings call Thursday.\n\nThe future Wentworth envisions is one in which pharmacies are local hubs for healthcare access.\n\nThe health ecosystem idealizes pharmacies \u2014 chains, independents, and online \u2014 as a way to maintain patient health. They have also been viewed as expert consultants in the case of minor healthcare needs ranging from advice on over-the-counter products to helping administer specialty drugs on site.\n\nWentworth wants to double down on that idea by investing in technology to help automate tasks for pharmacists in order to free them up for patients' needs.\n\n\"I am confident WBA will be a leader in the future of healthcare, with pharmacy and retail at its center,\" Wentworth said.\n\nHowever, that strategy hasn't worked in the past.\n\nTough economics\n\nThe idea of your friendly neighborhood pharmacist clashes with the economics of running a pharmacy and how they get paid by pharmacy benefit managers.\n\nIt's the struggle pharmacies of all sizes face with ever-decreasing reimbursements from the three largest pharmacy benefit managers: CVS Caremark (CVS), UnitedHealth's Optum Rx (UNH), and Cigna's Express Scripts (CI), where Wentworth previously served as CEO.\n\nWentworth said he is fighting \"to align incentives and ensure we are paid fairly.\"\n\nPharmacies have been fighting since before the pandemic. The impact of consumer trends on front-of-store sales (for beauty and food items), as well as the pressure of being paid fairly for prescriptions, has been the focus of earnings calls for years \u2014 and was a catalyst for both Walgreens' and CVS's healthcare services strategy.\n\nCOVID offered a brief reprieve for pharmacies, with increased revenues from vaccines, testing, and the need for over-the-counter medications.\n\nThat has since tapered off, forcing pharmacies to reduce business hours, close stores, and reconsider how to best utilize storefronts to serve evolving patient needs. In this June 4, 2014, file photo, people walk into a Walgreens retail store in Boston. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nLong-term view\n\nOne area in which Walgreens is ahead of the competition is clinical trials.\n\nThe company has been converting walk-in clinic spaces into clinical trial spaces and successfully clinched a deal with Boehringer Ingelheim.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced requirements for drug companies to diversify their clinical trial participant pool, for which Walgreens is now well poised.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut that didn't stop the sell-off Thursday on the news that the company would be struggling in the short term. It lead to the worst day for the company in nearly four decades, closing 22% lower Thursday.\n\nMost analysts believe the company is employing a solid strategy, but it will require patience to execute, especially as a key source of revenue, PBMs, are increasingly becoming competition.\n\nJPMorgan's Lisa Gill said in a note late Thursday that the process would take time.\n\n\"We continue to believe that in the longer-term, WBA has the potential for growth. If there is a silver lining to this print, we believe that the company is making the necessary steps to stabilize its footprint and working with PBMs and payors to manage reimbursement headwinds,\" she wrote.\n\nBank of America's Allen Lutz similarly noted, \"It is imperative that Walgreens pushes back more assertively against PBMs to capture a more reasonable return on capital.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"It is not fully clear if a more aggressive push by retail pharmacies would yield favorable results. However, the risk from continuing down the current path for WBA may prove worse.\"\n\nWalgreens is the largest retail pharmacy chain, with nearly 10,000 locations. Competitor CVS has more than 9,000, and RiteAid \u2014 which is currently in bankruptcy even after Walgreens acquired nearly 2,000 locations \u2014 has less than 2,000.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A dismal week for consumer stocks is raising concern about the financial health of US households just before the second-quarter earnings season begins in earnest next month.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden\u2019s Disastrous Debate Accelerates Doubts Over Candidacy Democrats Question Replacing Biden: Here\u2019s How It Could Work Gavin Newsom Is Ready for the Biden Emergency Biden Struggles as He Spars With Trump on Economy: Debate Takeaways Supreme Court Overturns Chevron Rule in Blow to Agency Power\n\nNike Inc. shares plunged the most since February 2001 on Friday after reporting weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue and projecting an unexpected decline in sales this fiscal year. The stock rout is set to wipe out roughly $27 billion of Nike\u2019s market value, and at least seven analysts tracked by Bloomberg have downgraded their ratings on shares in the wake of the update.\n\nThe sneaker company\u2019s results were \u201cjust the latest downbeat consumer data point in the last 36 hours,\u201d according to Adam Crisafulli, founder of the Vital Knowledge newsletter. Updates from Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., Levi Strauss & Co., and in Europe, Hennes & Mauritz AB and L\u2019Oreal SA, also flashed warning signals about the resiliency of shoppers. Reports from Pool Corp. and General Mills Inc. earlier this week similarly depicted households under pressure.\n\n\u201cClearly, the consumer is witnessing mounting headwinds,\u201d Crisafulli said.\n\nDespite persistent inflation and elevated borrowing costs, consumer spending \u2014 the main engine of the economy \u2014 has largely held up until recently, but cracks are starting to emerge. Wall Street will parse results from Corporate America beginning in mid-July for evidence of further consumer strain, which could shake the investor exuberance that\u2019s powered the S&P 500 Index to record after record this year.\n\n\u201cThe brands that aren\u2019t standing out are really struggling,\u201d said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \u201cNow we have a selective consumer, and as an investor you have to watch those trends.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, some companies like Nike are grappling with their own unique set of challenges. The world\u2019s largest sportswear company is transitioning its product lineup to reignite consumer interest as competition increases.\n\nIn its disappointing annual forecast Nike pointed to \u201caggressive actions\u201d it\u2019s taking amid weakness in key franchises, as well as increased macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in greater China, with \u201cuneven consumer trends\u201d continuing in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and other markets. Foreign-exchange headwinds are also weighing on the outlook, management said.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cConsumers are looking for newness and inspiration but are not just shopping for shopping sake to buy the same old things,\u201d said Jim Duffy, an analyst at Stifel who covers Nike. \u201cBrands delivering on this are seeing success but it is not a rising tide lifts all boats environment. Nike is a great example.\u201d\n\nPickier Consumers\n\nWalgreens shares suffered their worst day since at least 1980 on Thursday after the drugstore chain slashed its profit forecast for the full year due to a worsening retail environment. The company said its shoppers have become increasingly selective and price-sensitive in their purchases, which has led it to offer promotions that will dent profitability. Walgreens said it would close significantly more stores as its new chief executive officer seeks to turn the business around.\n\nWhile consumers are getting pickier about where they spend their dollars, it\u2019s clear they\u2019re not cutting out vacations just yet. Carnival Corp. raised its full-year earnings outlook earlier this week, owing the boost to record-setting demand and elevated ticket prices. Shares of the cruise line operator are up about 17% so far this week, on pace for their best weekly advance in a year.\n\nA plunge in Levi shares also demonstrated the cost of missing investors\u2019 high expectations. The stock dropped the most in over a year after the denim maker reported quarterly sales that fell just short of estimates. Sales in the Americas were strong, but results in Europe and Asia trailed Wall Street expectations.\n\nThings weren\u2019t much brighter in Europe. On Thursday, H&M shares dropped the most since December 2017 in Stockholm trading after the fast-fashion retailer reported a slump in sales in June, blaming bad weather in key markets that kept shoppers at home. Reaching a key profitability target has also become more challenging, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, L\u2019Oreal shares extended their slide this year after projecting slower growth for the overall beauty market in 2024, as softer trends in China weigh on sales after years of rapid gains.\n\nThe week started on a dour note when swimming pool supplies distributor Pool Corp. cut its profit outlook for the year, citing \u201cpersistently weak\u201d demand for new pool construction. The company flagged cautious consumer spending on big ticket items like pools and outdoor living projects. Its shares slid the most since July 2022 in the subsequent trading session, and the warning weighed on the likes of home improvement retailers Home Depot Inc. and Lowe\u2019s Cos.\n\nGeneral Mills\u2019 results on Wednesday signaled that consumers are also pulling back on essentials. Shares in the company behind food brands like Cheerios and Pillsbury dropped the most in nearly a year after it reported a sales shortfall and weaker-than-expected annual outlook.\n\n--With assistance from Joel Leon and Peyton Forte.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along Japan\u2019s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found Surging Returns Lure Private Equity Giants to India How Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for \u2018You\u2019 Perfume Into a Lasting Business\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Struggling Walgreens Boots Alliance Is Taking A New Direction\n\nOn Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) reported its fiscal third quarter results and they were not good. Besides coming short of Wall Street estimates, the pharmacy chain revealed it will be closing a significant number of unprofitable stores along with pulling back on its push into primary care. Upon the release of the report, shares tanked as much as 25%.\n\nFiscal third quarter highlights\n\nThe third quarter results reflected the extend of Walgreens\u2019 troubles as it faces worse-than-expected consumer spending, on top of many other challenges.\n\nFor the quarter ended on May 31s, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) pharmacy rival reported revenue\u00a0grew\u00a02.6% to $36.4 billion, surpassing LSEG\u2019s revenue estimate of\u00a0$35.94 billion\u00a0due to strong performance in healthcare. The\u00a0U.S. health-care unit\u00a0alone reported sales grew\u00a07.6%\u00a0YoY to\u00a0$2.13 billion.\u00a0The\u00a0U.S. retail pharmacy segment\u00a0also grew\u00a02.3%\u00a0as it brought in\u00a0$28.5\u00a0billion.\u00a0Pharmacy sales\u00a0grew\u00a04.4%\u00a0but retail sales\u00a0contracted by 4% amid a challenging environment. The\u00a0international\u00a0business grew 2.8% YoY to\u00a0$5.73 billion, with the UK Boots reporting growth of 1.6%.\n\nNet income nearly tripled to $344 million, or $0.40 per share,\u00a0reflecting better operating income. Adjusted earnings of\u00a063 cents\u00a0per share came short of LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a068 cents.\n\nOnce Again, A\u00a0Lowered Full Year Guidance\n\nThe full year earnings guidance being cut for the second time. While previously forecasting\u00a0a range\u00a0from\u00a0$3.20 to $3.35, Walgreens now expects them between\u00a0$2.80\u00a0and\u00a0$2.95 per share.\n\nStepping Away From Primary Care\n\nWalgreens will no longer be VillageMD\u2019s primary care provider as it plans to reduce its stake in the primary care provider. So much for the identity of a major provider in healthcare that the previous CEO,\u00a0Rosalind Brewer,\u00a0focused on creating.\n\nHowever, it is not planning to give up on its\u00a0overseas pharmacy chain Boots or specialty pharmacy firm,\u00a0Shields Health Solutions.\n\nWalgreens Is At A\u00a0Turning Point\n\nThe\u00a0123-year-old company\u00a0has been struggling for years with financial pressures\u00a0burdening its\u00a0core pharmacy business.\u00a0Prescription drugs used to be a major sales driver but their revenue growth is shrinking. Pharmacies are also bleeding shoppers to online pharmacies like the one from Amazon.com and struggling with labor agitation from pharmacists. The mighty Amazon is trying to revamp its healthcare offering as it just renamed its Amazon Clinic telehealth service. But Amazon continues its quest to improve the\u00a0medical care experience.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince last October, Walgreens got a new leader,\u00a0Tim Wentworth, who made a new team of top executives and is now expected to lay out the details of the strategic pivot he is planning to navigate Walmart through. What Wentworth did state is that retail pharmacy is central to\u00a0the\u00a0future\u00a0of Walgreens, while admitting it must undergo a significant transformation.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript June 27, 2024\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.63 EPS, expectations were $0.681.\n\nOperator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Walgreens Boots Alliance Third Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference call over to your speaker today, Tiffany Kanaga, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTiffany Kanaga: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Walgreens Boots Alliance earnings call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. I am Tiffany Kanaga, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Tim Wentworth, our Chief Executive Officer; and Manmohan Mahajan, Global Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Mary Langowski, President of U.S. Healthcare; Rick Gates, Senior Vice President and Walgreens\u2019 Chief Pharmacy Officer; and Tracey Brown, President of Walgreens\u2019 Retail and Chief Customer Officer will participate in Q&A. As always, during the conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 2 and those outlined in our latest Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements after this presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions, or otherwise. You can find our press release and the slides referenced on this call in the Investors section of the Walgreens Boots Alliance website. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations are set forth in the press release. You may also refer to the slides posted to the Investor section of our website for reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed during this earnings call. We encourage you to review the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliation to non-GAAP values in the other earnings materials we provided.\n\nI will now turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTim Wentworth: Thanks Tiffany and good morning everyone. While this quarter's results were not in line with our expectations, I want to start today by sharing some reflections on what I've observed since joining WBA. I'm at Walgreens today because I believe in the future of retail pharmacy and particularly, in our future. We are motivated by the trust Americans place every day in their Walgreens Pharmacy and the experience we provide them in our stores and with our digital offerings is important in their lives. Over our 125-year heritage, we have earned the right to engage with patients and customers in a way that few others can rival. I believe that this human-to-human interaction is an imperative in healthcare and the core foundation of our business is the relationship we have with our customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough our nationwide footprint, we touched nearly 9 million lives a day as the leading independent integrated retail pharmacy and healthcare provider. This dynamic is why PBMs, payers, providers, and pharma choose to work with Walgreens. Looking back over the last several quarters, we've built a world-class leadership team, including five new members. We now have the right people in place who are already executing with a sense of urgency on a turnaround for our business. All of this is underscored by our 330,000 passionate and dedicated team members who differentiate us and deliver exceptional customer and patient experiences every day. The bottom line is that I'm confident WBA will be a leader in the future of healthcare with pharmacy and retail at its center.\n\nAnd the long-term potential of the company will be shaped by offerings built around the relationship that we've nurtured with our customers over time. But we also acknowledge where we are today and what we need to do to realize our longer-term ambitions. The severity and duration of the challenges in the operating environment have only added urgency to our strategic and operational review, and we are addressing them directly. Our review has been a significant driver of action as we assess both our existing Retail Pharmacy business and our collection of strategic assets. I will unpack the series of conclusions we have reached in greater detail after Manmohan and I review the quarterly results. For the third quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.63, reflecting significant challenges in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy business stemming from a worse than expected consumer environment and challenging pharmacy industry trends, partially offset by strength in U.S. healthcare and international.\n\nIn light of these factors, we are reducing our full year outlook, which Manmohan will take you through in more detail. In U.S. Retail Pharmacy, we witnessed continued pressure on the U.S. consumer. Our customers have become increasingly selective and price sensitive in their purchases. In response, we invested in targeted promotion and price decisions, which have driven traffic and will generate improved customer loyalty, but they weigh on near-term profitability as we refine our approach. We remain relentlessly focused on enhancing the front of store and creating the right omnichannel experience for our customers while driving in-store efficiencies. We also continue to face an incrementally challenging pharmacy industry. Recent trends such as branded mix impacts and increased regulatory and reimbursement pressures, including fluctuations in NADAC pricing have negatively impacted pricing dynamics.\n\nAdditionally, the script market is growing but continues to trail below pre-pandemic growth levels. These headwinds have affected our performance and are materially weighing on our ability to serve patients profitably. We are at a point where the current pharmacy model is not sustainable and the challenges in our operating environment require we approach the market differently. For example, we are in active discussions with our PBM and payer partners to align incentives and ensure we are paid fairly. We are also working with our suppliers and partnering directly with pharma companies to build out specialty pharmacy, clinical trials and other services, which Walgreens is uniquely positioned to facilitate given our physical footprint and the trust we've already established with patients.\n\nIn U.S. healthcare, we had another quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA and year-on-year growth, driven by continued growth and disciplined cost management at VillageMD along with strength at shields. Following last quarter's actions to right-size VillageMD's footprint, the business is now on a clearer path to profitability as it continues to add lives and optimize its cost structure. In International, the business continues to perform strongly and in line with expectations. Boots U.K. delivered meaningful retail comp growth and achieved another sequential quarter of market share gains from strength in both physical and digital channels. We continued to execute with discipline across the organization to drive further cost out and prioritize free cash flow.\n\nWe remain on track to deliver $1 billion in cost savings this year. As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, we are operating under the following assumptions. We expect the operating environment to remain challenging. We do not expect an improvement in the U.S. retail environment. And finally, we expect script volume growth to remain muted and anticipate continued pressures on pharmacy margins. In light of these factors, we are reducing our outlook. We now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 to $2.95 for the fiscal year 2024. While we acknowledge that this range is wider than normal, we believe it is prudent given fluctuations in recent pharmacy industry trends. Consistent with our historic approach, we will provide our outlook for fiscal 2025 on our fiscal year end call in October, but we expect the current trends I've outlined to persist into next year.\n\nBefore going into details of our strategic review, I'll now turn it over to Manmohan to review our financial results.\n\nManmohan Mahajan: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter sales grew 2.5% on a constant currency basis. U.S. retail pharmacy increased 2.3%. International was up 1.6% and U.S. Healthcare delivered sales growth of 7.6%. As Tim mentioned, overall results were below our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $0.63 decreased 37% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. This was driven by a $0.24 impact from lower sale leaseback gains, a challenging U.S. retail environment and recent pharmacy trends. Our U.S. healthcare and international segments continued to perform in line with our expectations, and we continue to deliver on our goals related to cost and CapEx reduction and working capital initiatives. As a reminder, last year's GAAP results included after-tax impairment charges of $323 million related to pharmacy license intangible assets in Boots U.K..\n\nLet's move on to the year-to-date highlights. Sales increased 5.6% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EPS declined 25% on a constant currency basis due to the softer U.S. retail pharmacy performance and significantly lower sale leaseback gains. This was partly offset by cost-saving initiatives, improved profitability in U.S. health care and a lower adjusted effective tax rate. GAAP net loss was $5.6 billion compared to a loss of $2.9 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The first nine months of fiscal 2024 included certain non-cash impairment charges related to VillageMD goodwill as detailed last quarter. The prior year period included a $5.5 billion after-tax charge for opioid-related claims and lawsuits partly offset by a $1.5 billion after-tax gain on the sale of Cencora and Option Care Health shares.\n\nNow let me cover U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. Comparable sales grew 3.5% year-on-year driven by brand inflation and pharmacy and prescription volume, partly offset by a decline in retail sales. AOI decreased 48% versus the prior year quarter. Approximately 70% of this decline relates to lower sale leaseback gains lapping reduced incentive accruals in the prior year and lower Cencora equity income. Challenging retail and pharmacy industry trends also negatively impacted AOI in the current period. Sale leaseback gains net of incremental rent expense, resulted in a $277 million headwind to AOI in the quarter. As discussed three months ago, we do not anticipate any material benefits from sale-leaseback gains going forward. Headwinds in the retail and pharmacy businesses were partly offset by cost savings initiatives.\n\nLet me now turn to U.S. Pharmacy. Pharmacy comp sales increased 5.7% driven by brand inflation and volume growth. Comp scripts excluding immunization grew 1.7% in the quarter. We are tracking in line with the overall prescription market year-to-date. However, overall prescription market growth remains below expectations, primarily due to Medicaid redeterminations. Pharmacy adjusted gross margin declined versus the prior year quarter driven by brand mix impacts, reimbursement pressure reflecting last year's negotiations, lower COVID testing demand and incremental pressure from certain generic launches with procurement dynamics similar to brands. Recent fluctuations in NADAC drove an incremental $20 million of the partial quarter impact. Turning next to our U.S. retail business, comparable retail sales declined 2.3% in the quarter.\n\nAs Tim mentioned, the consumer backdrop remains a challenge. With this continued channel shift and a sustained pullback in discretionary spending, we have responded by lowering prices across health and wellness, personal care and seasonal categories. Where we invested in price and promotions, we saw returns in sales and unit lift. At the same time, value-seeking behavior and new product launches year-to-date helped to drive our own brand penetration up 65 basis points in the quarter. While we're seeing early signs of customers responding to our actions, retail gross margin declined more than previously anticipated due to our price and promo investments this year lapping last year's margin recovery actions as well as higher levels of shrink. A pharmacist discussing the health benefits of a prescription medication with a customer.\n\nThis was partly offset by positive impact on gross margin from our category performance improvement initiatives, which are tracking in line with our expectations as we deepen relationship with select suppliers. Turning next to international segment, and as always, I will talk in constant currency numbers. Total sales grew 1.6% with Boots U.K. increasing 1.6% and Germany Wholesale up 4.9%. Segment adjusted gross profit increased 2% with growth across all businesses. Adjusted operating income was down 17% due to lapping real estate gains in the prior year period. Let's now cover Boots U.K. in detail. Boots U.K. continues to perform well. Comp pharmacy sales were up 5.8%. Comp retail sales increased 6% with all categories showing growth. Across formats, destination health and beauty, flagship and travel locations performed particularly well.\n\nBoots.com sales increased 13.8% year-on-year and represented nearly 16% of our U.K. retail sales. Turning next to U.S. Healthcare. The U.S. Healthcare segment delivered its second consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter sales of $2.1 billion increased 8% compared to prior year quarter. VillageMD sales of $1.6 billion grew 7% year-on-year. The increase was driven by growth in full risk and fee-for-service lives, partly offset by the impact of clinic closures. Shields sales were up 24% driven by growth within existing partnerships. Adjusted EBITDA was $23 million, an improvement of $136 million compared to last year, driven by rightsizing costs, improved productivity at VillageMD and continued robust growth at Shields. Turning next to cash flow.\n\nOperating cash flow in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was negatively impacted by $785 million in payments related to legal matters $386 million in annuity premium contributions related to Boots Pension Plan and underlying seasonality. Capital expenditures declined by $497 million versus the first nine months of fiscal 2023. As a result, free cash flow was down by approximately $1.1 billion versus the prior year. We continue on pace to achieve a year-over-year reduction of $600 million in capital expenditures and $500 million in working capital initiatives in fiscal 2024. I will now turn to guidance. We are lowering our fiscal 2024 adjusted EPS guidance to $2.80 to $2.95. The updated range versus our expectations three months ago, incorporates two key items.\n\nFirst, the U.S. consumer environment has not improved and is driving higher promotional activity, negatively impacting retail margin. We continue to expect fiscal 2024 retail comp sales to be down approximately 3%. Second is the continuation of worse-than-expected pharmacy margin headwinds. Pharmacy margins in the second half include impact from certain generic launches with procurement dynamics similar to brands, fluctuations in NADAC, inflation and mix within branded drugs and lower overall market growth. We are maintaining full year expectations for U.S. Healthcare segment adjusted EBITDA to be breakeven at the midpoint of the guidance range. We continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be under 5%. Our revised full year guidance range implies fourth quarter adjusted EPS of approximately $0.39 at the midpoint.\n\nWhile we're not providing fiscal 2025 guidance today, let me offer key considerations to bridge from fourth quarter to next year. Seasonality impacts all of our businesses and the fourth quarter is typically the lowest quarter of the year. Additionally, we expect profitability growth in U.S. healthcare and international segments. However, as Tim mentioned, there are other factors discussed on today's call that we assume will impact fiscal 2025. Our decision to wind down the sale-leaseback program, sales Cencora shares and a more normalized adjusted effective tax rate are expected to have an approximately $0.75 impact in fiscal 2025. In retail, despite easing comparisons, we do not anticipate significant improvement in the U.S. consumer spending backdrop.\n\nWe are especially seeing signs of strain on the lower income consumer, driven by accumulated inflation and depleted savings. While we're adopting our model, these changes will take time. We expect to see some pharmacy headwinds continue in fiscal 2025. However, we are focused on stabilizing pharmacy margins as we continue to have active discussions with our PBM, payer and supplier partners. We have more hard work ahead of us, and we are focused on building a solid foundation for the future. Driving the stabilization of our business and returning to longer-term enterprise growth. With that, let me pass it back to Tim.\n\nTim Wentworth: Thanks, Manmohan. Let me now turn to our strategic review. Since launching our strategic and operational review at the beginning of the calendar year, we have been clear eyed on what we're trying to achieve and everything has been on the table. We have a deep understanding of the opportunities and complexities and we have come to a number of important conclusions. Some will take more time to execute as we maximize optionality, but all of them are aligned around three principles to drive long-term shareholder value. First, to simplify and focus our business. Second, to use our core foundation, our relationship with our customers to grow and expand in capital-efficient ways into adjacent areas. And third, to continue to identify opportunities to deliver profitable growth, generate meaningful cash flow, and strengthen our strategically-relevant businesses today and long-term.\n\nBefore unpacking the details, I want to reinforce the most important conclusion from our review. The Retail Pharmacy experience will be more important to the healthcare industry in the years ahead, but it will evolve. With widespread demand for convenient healthcare solutions, including chronic diseases, and nationwide labor shortages, the pharmacy and pharmacists have never been more important. Our Retail Pharmacy business is uniquely positioned to expand the role we play in the lives of our patients who have come to expect and need retail pharmacy at the center of their care. So, let me begin this discussion around our strategic decisions with our core business, U.S. Retail Pharmacy. The success of the business hinges on an efficient, highly relevant customer experience, and we've launched a multifaceted action plan for improvement.\n\nAs the convenient destination for millions of customers and driving $27 billion of retail sales, the store and its digital channels are central to our strategy and consumer experience. But the customers involved, demographics and preferences have shifted, and we need to reposition and operate our stores accordingly. Currently, 75% of our U.S. stores contribute roughly 100% of segment AOI. For the remaining 25% of the stores in our network, which are not currently contributing to our long-term strategy, changes are imminent. To start, we are finalizing a multifactor store footprint optimization program which we expect will include the closure of a significant portion of these underperforming stores over the next three years. Plans to finalize this number are in motion and we will update you in due course.\n\nFor the remaining portion of this cohort, we are taking action to return them to profitability and deliver an improved customer experience. We will contemplate additional closures if performance does not improve, which includes external factors such as reimbursement rates. While it is not an easy decision to close a store, we will work to minimize customer disruptions and importantly, as we have done in the past, we intend to redeploy the vast majority of the workforce in those stores that we close. In addition to these closures, we are taking a series of actions and making investments to enhance the customer and patient experience across several key areas. First, we are reevaluating our assortment to ensure its relevancy, leveraging select partners and our own brands.\n\nThis means we will work with fewer partners who are helping us win. For example, in the last quarter alone, we've removed eight national brands and redeployed those SKUs towards own brands and preferred partners within health and wellness categories. We are sharpening our focus as a destination for areas we are uniquely positioned to lead such as health and beauty and women's health. We are accelerating our digital and omnichannel offerings to meet our customers when, where and how they want to engage. We continue to deliver approximately 80% of same-day delivery orders within one hour and we see upside for improvement. As the ultra-convenient option for our over 120 million myWalgreens loyalty members, we have plans to meaningfully build our loyalty program.\n\nWe are doubling down on our efforts to define the future of pharmacy in this country. As I mentioned earlier, this starts with changing the dialogue with payers and PBMs to ensure we are paid fairly for the value we provide. We are also investing in the industry's best talent. For example, as we focus on leading in the development and elevation of the pharmacy industry profession, we are partnering with critical stakeholders such as our Deans Advisory Council to help advance our work environment and make WBA the practice setting destination of choice for pharmacy talent. Just two weeks ago, we spent two full days with 14 deans of pharmacy across our country engaging in productive discussions to reinvigorate the community pharmacy labor supply chain.\n\nAnd we are enhancing our pharmacy services, like immunizations, to attract more patients through an improved experience and enhanced digital solutions. We've significantly decreased the average wait time per customer in the highest volume stores, and this is a result of several initiatives underway to improve the patient experience and increase retention. Finally, with a mindset for driving continuous improvement throughout the organization, we are committed to operating with excellence and identifying further efficiencies in both our headquarters and our retail operations. We are restructuring our organization around these conclusions to streamline and ensure efficient development and deployment of services to go to market as one Walgreens with more impact for our industry partners and to help close critical gaps in delivery of healthcare.\n\nIn that regard, Mary Langowski, our President of U.S. Healthcare, will assume responsibility for operations of specialty pharmacy, pharma and manufacturer relations and contracting, supply chain, and all services development and deployment. With these operations now under one team, we will be better aligned to go where the market is moving, sharpen our contracting, operate more efficiently and achieve better economic outcomes. And Rick Gates, our Chief Pharmacy Officer, will take on an even greater role in defining the future of pharmacy from a strategic, operational and labor force perspective. Turning to our broader portfolio, we have evaluated every non-retail pharmacy asset, prioritizing strategic fit, profit growth potential and cash flow generation.\n\nWith that in mind, we have already stopped or will stop initiatives that distract from our focus and will grow in areas that create longer-term shareholder value. Let me touch on several of our larger assets. Our review of Boots UK showed that we have attractive options to unlock value in this business. While we believe there is significant interest in Boots at the right time, its growth, strategic strength and cash flow remain key contributors to the company. We are committed to continuing to invest in Boots UK and find innovative ways for this business to fulfill its potential. Moving next to VillageMD, which currently includes three distinct assets in VillageMD, Summit Health and CityMD, we believe in the future of these businesses and intend to remain an investor and partner.\n\nBut as part of our persistent focus on value creation for WBA, we are collaborating with leadership toward an endpoint to rapidly unlock liquidity, enhance optionality and position them for additional growth. As it relates to shields, its performance, growth and leadership team remain best-in-class and serve as a complement to our core specialty business in the market. We are not taking action at this time. We are committed to executing on all of these decisions in a timely manner that maximizes shareholder value while creating optionality. And I look forward to providing more details as we progress. Before opening the call up for Q&A, let me leave you with four thoughts. First, our core retail pharmacy business is relevant, but will be different.\n\nSecond, we have the right team and the right strategy to enhance our focus, strengthen our own execution and ultimately turn around the business performance. Third, there is a clear market need for our services, but our economics are not currently structured in a way that is sensible for our shareholders. We have a firm grasp of the issues and are working to address these challenges in our business model. Fourth, while it may take time, and there's a great deal of work underway, I am confident we are executing on the conclusions from our strategic review thoughtfully and urgently to deliver the Walgreens that our country needs. With that, let's begin Q&A. Operator?\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of WBA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than WBA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks That Should Have Replaced Sirius XM Holdings in the Nasdaq 100 (Rather Than ARM)",
        "content": "When I\u00a0 first thought of the idea for this article, Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI) was still a part of the Nasdaq 100, a collection of 100 of the largest non-financial stocks listed on Nasdaq. However, there was speculation certain companies were Nasdaq 100 stock candidates to replace the satellite radio business.\n\nSure enough, on June 13, Nasdaq announced that SIRI was out and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) was in. Sirius XM was ousted from the index because its market capitalization had fallen below 0.1% of the total market cap of the 100 companies.\n\nWith the addition-subraction move, the index\u2019s total market cap jumped by approximately $150 billion. It now sits at $26.03 trillion. This suggests that several other companies could be dropped from the index in the weeks and months ahead. Possible deletions include Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), which is the smallest weighting in the index at 0.09%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith up to four stocks on the chopping block, here are my three Nasdaq 100 stock candidates.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is the largest of my three recommendations by market cap at $49.24 billion. Not only would it be a good stock candidate for the Nasdaq 100, it also could use a stock split with its shares up 194% in 2024, and trading above $840.\n\nAs Barron\u2019s pointed out in its coverage of the NASDAQ 100 in mid-June, Super Micro\u2019s huge gains in 2024 was a big reason for it being added to the S&P 500, so it\u2019s very possible the server maker could be next after ARM.\n\nWorking against Super Micro is the fact there are already 39 technology companies in the NASDAQ 100. If added, it would have a larger market cap than just 12 of them.\n\nWorking in its favor is the fact it\u2019s fairly popular with analysts. Of the 19 that cover its stock, 14 rate it a Buy, with a target price of $1,029.76, 23% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\nAlso working in its favor: There are no computer hardware companies in the index. Of the five large-cap (over $10 billion) technology stocks trading on Nasdaq in the computer hardware industry, SMCI has the largest market cap.\n\nTractor Supply (TSCO) The exterior of a Tractor Supply (TSCO) store\n\nSource: James R. Martin/Shutterstock.com\n\nTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) is a specialty retailer in Tennessee. I\u2019ve liked its business for a long time. As far back as September 2014, I discussed with InvestorPlace readers why the retailer, whose primary customer was, and still is, the gentleman farmer, was a great stock to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the time, it operated 1,300 stores in 48 states. Today, it operates 2,233 Tractor Supply stores in 49 states, plus 202 Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in 23 states. In 2014, it had revenue of $5.71 billion, and $589.5 million operating income. In 2023, revenues and operating income were $14.56 billion and $1.48 billion, respectively, which works out to compound annual growth of 10.96% and\u00a0 10.77%.\n\nAs a result, its shares have a compound annual growth rate of 13.8% over the past 9.5 years. Including dividends, it has a 10-year annualized total return of 16.4%.\n\nNot too shabby.\n\nAnalysts are mixed about TSCO stock. Of the 33 that cover Tractor Supply, 16 rate at a buy, less than half the analyst coverage. Further, the target price of $278 is just 4% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not cheap right now with a price-to-sales ratio of 1.97x, its highest level since 2021. However, over the long term it\u2019s proven to be a winner.\n\nFerrovial (FER) A series of roads and overpasses connect in an aerial view.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe smallest of three NASDAQ stocks by market cap is Ferrovial (NASDAQ:FER), the European-based infrastructure operator. The company operates toll roads, airports, and builds infrastructure worldwide.\n\nFounded in 1952, the company began work on railway projects in Spain. In 1958, Renfe, the Spanish railway company, awarded Ferrovial the contract to build an 18-mile railway link between Las Rosas and\u00a0 Chamart\u00edn, in Madrid.\n\nAn example of its work is the 407 ETR toll highway in the Greater Toronto Area in Canada. It built the 67-mile toll road and owns 43.23% of the 407 ETR Concession Company Limited, which operates it.\n\nIn June 2022, the company\u2019s Airports business acquired the rights to design, build, and operate the new Terminal One at New York\u2019s JFK airport. It has a lease through 2060.\n\nOf the 10 companies in the index from the Industrials sector, none represents the infrastructure industry. There are 23 Industrials companies trading on Nasdaq with a market cap over $10 billion. It has the 11th largest at $27.34 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nNike (NKE)\n\nShares in sportswear giant Nike sank in premarket trade on Friday, after it issued a full-year outlook that missed expectations, with revenue declining in the mid-single digits in the company\u2019s current fiscal year. Analysts had expected growth of about 2%, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe company said quarterly revenue in the fourth quarter fell 2% from the year prior to $12.61bn, below Wall Street's estimates for $12.9bn. Nike's $0.99 earnings per share exceeded analysts' expectations of $0.66. Nike's direct-to-consumer sales declined 8% from the same quarter a year ago to $5.1bn.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShares were trading as much as 13% lower in premarket. The news also hit London-listed JD Sports (JD.L) which was one of the top fallers in the FTSE 100.\n\nTrump Media (DJT)\n\nThe share price of Donald Trump's media company looked set to regain Thursday's losses when markets open later on in the US, with premarket data suggesting a rise of almost 8% at the opening bell, after the first presidential debate was aired last night.\n\nPolls showed two-thirds of voters thought Trump \u2018won\u2019 the debate, sending confidence in his SPAC-listed company higher.\n\nShares in the company, which owns Truth Social, have dipped in recent weeks as the presidential race plays out and the company filed for a resale of stock.\n\nWalgreens (WBA)\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance stock plummeted 22% on Thursday, its worst trading in at least four decades, closing at $12.19 per share.\n\nThe stock slumped on the news the company slashed its profit guidance, the second time it has adjusted guidance downward this year.\n\nWalgreens now estimates earnings per share of between $2.80 and $2.95, down from guidance of $3.20 to $3.35 last quarter \u2014 when it narrowed guidance on the upper end.\n\nInvestors are watching the company closely as CEO Tim Wentworth executes a new strategy for the company. He is focused on what he views as revitalising pharmacies and pulling back on healthcare services through VillageMD \u2014 of which Walgreens is no longer a major stakeholder.\n\nStory continues\n\nL'Oreal (OR.PA)\n\nBeauty product giant L'Oreal saw its stock dip more than 2.7% on Friday following a revision of its global beauty market growth forecast from 5% to a range of 4.5-5%.\n\nThe revision is reaction to volatility in China \u2014 an important market for the brand.\n\nThe share price is now at its lowest point since mid-April.\n\nWatch: S&P 500 and Nasdaq, Boeing, recession warnings: Market Domination Overtime<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">^GSPC</a>, <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI?p=%5EDJI&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">^DJI</a>, <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EIXIC?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">^IXIC</a>) all closed Tuesday's session in the green in the middle of this holiday-shortened trading week.

Welcome to the Walgreens Boots Alliance third-quarter 2024 results conference call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference call over to your speaker today, Tiffany Kanaga, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTiffany Kanaga\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for the Walgreens Boots Alliance earnings call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. I'm Tiffany Kanaga, Vice President of Investor Relations.\r\nJoining me on today's call are Tim Wentworth, our Chief Executive Officer; and Manmohan Mahajan, Global Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Mary Langowski, President of US Healthcare; Rick Gates, Senior Vice President and Walgreens' Chief Pharmacy Officer; and Tracey Brown, President of Walgreens Retail and Chief Customer Officer, will participate in Q&A.\r\nAs always, during the conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 2 and those outlined in our latest Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement after this presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. You can find our press release and the slides referenced on this call in the Investors section of the Walgreens Boots Alliance website.\r\nDuring this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and the reconciliations are set forth in the press release. You may also refer to the slides posted to the Investors section of our website for reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed during this earnings call. We encourage you to review the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliation to non-GAAP values in the other earnings materials we provided. I will now turn the call over to Tim.\n\nStory continues\n\nTimothy Wentworth\n\nThanks, Tiffany, and good morning, everyone. While this quarter's results were not in line with our expectations, I want to start today by sharing some reflections on what I've observed since joining WBA. I'm at Walgreens today because I believe in the future of retail pharmacy and particularly in our future. We are motivated by the trust Americans place every day in their Walgreens pharmacy. And the experience we provide them in our stores and with our digital offerings is important in their lives.\r\nOver our 125-year heritage, we have earned the right to engage with patients and customers in a way that few others can rival. I believe that this human-to-human interaction is an imperative in healthcare, and the core foundation of our business is the relationship we have with our customers. Through our nationwide footprint, we touch nearly 9 million lives a day as the leading independent integrated retail pharmacy and healthcare provider. This dynamic is why PBMs, payers, providers, and pharma choose to work with Walgreens.\r\nLooking back over the last several quarters, we've built a world-class leadership team, including five new members. We now have the right people in place who are already executing with a sense of urgency on a turnaround for our business. All of this is underscored by our 330,000 passionate and dedicated team members who differentiate us and deliver exceptional customer and patient experiences every day.\r\nThe bottom line is that I'm confident WBA will be a leader in the future of healthcare with pharmacy and retail at its center. And the long-term potential of the company will be shaped by offerings built around the relationship that we've nurtured with our customers over time.\r\nBut we also acknowledge where we are today and what we need to do to realize our longer-term ambitions. The severity and duration of the challenges in the operating environment have only added urgency to our strategic and operational review, and we are addressing them directly. Our review has been a significant driver of action as we assess both our existing retail pharmacy business and our collection of strategic assets. I will unpack the series of conclusions we have reached in greater detail after Manmohan, and I review the quarterly results.\r\nFor the third quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.63, reflecting significant challenges in the US retail pharmacy business stemming from a worse-than-expected consumer environment and challenging pharmacy industry trends, partially offset by strength in US healthcare and international. In light of these factors, we are reducing our full year outlook, which Manmohan will take you through in more detail.\r\nIn US retail pharmacy, we witnessed continued pressure on the US consumer. Our customers have become increasingly selective and price-sensitive in their purchases. In response, we invested in targeted promotion and price decisions which have driven traffic and will generate improved customer loyalty, but they weigh on near-term profitability as we refine our approach. We remain relentlessly focused on enhancing the front of store and creating the right omnichannel experience for our customers while driving in-store efficiencies.\r\nWe also continue to face an incrementally challenging pharmacy industry. Recent trends such as branded mix impacts and increased regulatory and reimbursement pressures, including fluctuations in NADAC pricing, have negatively impacted pricing dynamics.\r\nAdditionally, the script market is growing but continues to trail below pre-pandemic growth levels. These headwinds have affected our performance and are materially weighing on our ability to serve patients profitably.\r\nWe are at a point where the current pharmacy model is not sustainable and the challenges in our operating environment require, we approach the market differently. For example, we are in active discussions with our PBM and payer partners to align incentives and ensure we are paid fairly.\r\nWe are also working with our suppliers and partnering directly with pharma companies to build out specialty pharmacy, clinical trials, and other services, which Walgreens is uniquely positioned to facilitate, given our physical footprint and the trust we've already established with patients.\r\nIn US healthcare, we had another quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA and year-on-year growth driven by continued growth and disciplined cost management at VillageMD along with strength at Shields. Following last quarter's actions to rightsize VillageMD's footprint, the business is now on a clearer path to profitability as it continues to add lives and optimize its cost structure.\r\nIn international, the business continues to perform strongly and in line with expectations. Boots UK delivered meaningful retail comp growth and achieved another sequential quarter of market share gains from strength in both physical and digital channels. We continued to execute with discipline across the organization to drive further cost out and prioritize free cash flow. We remain on track to deliver $1 billion in cost savings this year.\r\nAs we look ahead to the remainder of the year, we are operating under the following assumptions. We expect the operating environment to remain challenging. We do not expect an improvement in the US retail environment. And finally, we expect script volume growth to remain muted and anticipate continued pressures on pharmacy margins.\r\nIn light of these factors, we are reducing our outlook. We now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 to $2.95 for the fiscal year 2024. While we acknowledge that this range is wider than normal, we believe it is prudent, given fluctuations in recent pharmacy industry trends. Consistent with our historic approach, we will provide our outlook for fiscal 2025 on our fiscal year-end call in October, but we expect the current trends I've outlined to persist into next year. Before going into details of our strategic review, I'll now turn it over to Manmohan to review our financial results.\n\nManmohan Mahajan\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter sales grew 2.5% on a constant currency basis. US retail pharmacy increased 2.3%. International was up 1.6%, and US healthcare delivered sales growth of 7.6%.\r\nAs Tim mentioned, overall results were below our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $0.63 decreased 37% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. This was driven by a $0.24 impact from lower sale-leaseback gains, a challenging US retail environment and recent pharmacy trends.\r\nOur US healthcare and international segments continued to perform in line with our expectations. And we continue to deliver on our goals related to cost and CapEx reduction and working capital initiatives. As a reminder, last year's GAAP results included after-tax impairment charges of $323 million related to pharmacy license and tangible assets in Boots UK.\r\nLet's move on to the year-to-date highlights. Sales increased 5.6% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EPS declined 25% on a constant currency basis due to the softer US retail pharmacy performance and significantly lower sale-leaseback gains. This was partly offset by cost-saving initiatives, improved profitability in US healthcare and a lower adjusted effective tax rate.\r\nGAAP net loss was $5.6 billion compared to a loss of $2.9 billion in the first nine months of fiscal '23. The first nine months of fiscal '24 included certain non-cash impairment charges related to VillageMD goodwill as detailed last quarter. The prior year period included a $5.5 billion after-tax charge for opioid-related claims and lawsuits, partly offset by a $1.5 billion after-tax gain on the sale of Cencora and Option Care Health shares.\r\nNow let me cover US retail pharmacy segment. Comparable sales grew 3.5% year-on-year driven by brand inflation and pharmacy and prescription volume, partly offset by a decline in retail sales.\r\nAOI decreased 48% versus the prior year quarter. Approximately 70% of this decline relates to lower sale-leaseback gains lapping reduced incentive accruals in the prior year and lower Cencora equity income. Challenging retail and pharmacy industry trends also negatively impacted AOI in the current period.\r\nSale-leaseback gains, net of incremental rent expense, resulted in a $277 million headwind to AOI in the quarter. As discussed, three months ago, we do not anticipate any material benefits from sale-leaseback gains going forward. Headwinds in the retail and pharmacy businesses were partly offset by cost savings initiatives.\r\nLet me now turn to US pharmacy. Pharmacy comp sales increased 5.7% driven by brand inflation and volume growth. Comp scripts, excluding immunization, grew 1.7% in the quarter. We are tracking in line with the overall prescription market year to date. However, overall prescription market growth remains below expectations primarily due to Medicaid redeterminations.\r\nPharmacy adjusted gross margin declined versus the prior year quarter driven by brand mix impacts, reimbursement pressure reflecting last year's negotiations, lower COVID testing demand, and incremental pressure from certain generic launches with procurement dynamics similar to brands. Recent fluctuations in NADAC drove an incremental $20 million of the partial quarter impact.\r\nTurning next to our US retail business. Comparable retail sales declined 2.3% in the quarter. As Tim mentioned, the consumer backdrop remains a challenge. With this continued channel shift and a sustained pullback in discretionary spending, we have responded by lowering prices across health and wellness, personal care, and seasonal categories.\r\nWhere we invested in price and promotions, we saw returns in sales and unit lift. At the same time, value-seeking behavior and new product launches year-to-date helped to drive our own brand penetration up 65 basis points in the quarter.\r\nWhile we're seeing early signs of customers responding to our actions, retail gross margin declined more than previously anticipated due to our price and promo investments this year lapping last year's margin recovery actions as well as higher levels of shrink. This was partly offset by positive impact on gross margin from our category performance improvement initiatives, which are tracking in line with our expectations as we deepen relationship with select suppliers.\r\nTurning next to international segment. And as always, I will talk in constant currency numbers. Total sales grew 1.6% with Boots UK increasing 1.6% and Germany wholesale up 4.9%. Segment adjusted gross profit increased 2% with growth across all businesses. Adjusted operating income was down 17% due to lapping real estate gains in the prior year period.\r\nLet's now cover Boots UK in detail. Boots UK continues to perform well. Comp pharmacy sales were up 5.8%. Comp retail sales increased 6% with all categories showing growth. Across formats, destination health and beauty, flagship and travel locations performed particularly well. Boots.com sales increased 13.8% year-on-year and represented nearly 16% of our UK retail sales.\r\nTurning next to US healthcare. The US healthcare segment delivered its second consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter sales of $2.1 billion increased 8% compared to prior year quarter.\r\nVillageMD sales, up $1.6 billion grew 7% year on year. The increase was driven by growth in full risk and fee-for-service lives, partly offset by the impact of clinic closures. Shields sales were up 24% driven by growth within existing partnerships. Adjusted EBITDA was $23 million, an improvement of $136 million compared to last year driven by rightsizing costs, improved productivity at VillageMD, and continued robust growth at Shields.\r\nTurning next to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the first nine months of fiscal '24 was negatively impacted by $785 million in payments related to legal matters, $386 million in entity premium, contributions related to Boots pension plan, and underlying seasonality.\r\nCapital expenditures declined by $497 million versus the first nine months of fiscal '23. As a result, free cash flow was down by approximately $1.1 billion versus the prior year. We continue on pace to achieve a year-over-year reduction of $600 million in capital expenditures and $500 million in working capital initiatives in fiscal '24.\r\nI will now turn to guidance. We are lowering our fiscal '24 adjusted EPS guidance to $2.80 to $2.95. The updated range versus our expectations three months ago incorporates two key items.\r\nFirst, the US consumer environment has not improved and is driving higher promotional activity, negatively impacting retail margin. We continue to expect fiscal '24 retail comp sales to be down approximately 3%. Second is the continuation of worse-than-expected pharmacy margin headwinds. Pharmacy margins in the second half include impact from certain generic launches with procurement dynamics similar to brands, fluctuations in NADAC, inflation and mix within branded drugs, and lower overall market growth.\r\nWe are maintaining full year expectations for US healthcare segment adjusted EBITDA to be breakeven at the midpoint of the guidance range. We continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be under 5%. Our revised full year guidance range implies fourth quarter adjusted EPS of approximately $0.39 at the midpoint. While we're not providing fiscal '25 guidance today, let me offer key considerations to bridge from fourth quarter to next year.\r\nSeasonality impacts all of our businesses, and the fourth quarter is typically the lowest quarter of the year. Additionally, we expect profitability growth in US healthcare and international segments. However, as Tim mentioned, there are other factors discussed on today's call that we assume will impact fiscal '25. Our decision to wind down the sale-leaseback program, sell Cencora shares, and a more normalized adjusted effective tax rate are expected to have an approximately $0.75 impact in fiscal '25.\r\nIn retail, despite easing comparisons, we do not anticipate significant improvement in the US consumer spending backdrop. We are especially seeing signs of strength on the lower-income consumer driven by accumulated inflation and depleted savings. While we're adopting our model, these changes will take time.\r\nWe expect to see some pharmacy headwinds continue in fiscal '25. However, we are focused on stabilizing pharmacy margins as we continue to have active discussions with our PBM, payer, and supplier partners. We have more hard work ahead of us, and we are focused on building a solid foundation for the future, driving the stabilization of our business and returning to longer-term enterprise growth. With that, let me pass it back to Tim.\n\nTimothy Wentworth\n\nThanks, Manmohan. Let me now turn to our strategic review. Since launching our strategic and operational review at the beginning of the calendar year, we have been clear-eyed on what we're trying to achieve, and everything has been on the table.\r\nWe have a deep understanding of the opportunities and complexities, and we have come to a number of important conclusions. Some will take more time to execute as we maximize optionality, but all of them are aligned around three principles to drive long-term shareholder value. First, to simplify and focus our business. Second, to use our core foundation, our relationship with our customers, to grow and expand in capital-efficient ways into adjacent areas. And third, to continue to identify opportunities to deliver profitable growth, generate meaningful cash flow, and strengthen our strategically relevant businesses today and long term.\r\nBefore unpacking the details, I want to reinforce the most important conclusion from our review. The retail pharmacy experience will be more important to the healthcare industry in the years ahead, but it will evolve. With widespread demand for convenient healthcare solutions, including chronic diseases, and nationwide labor shortages, the pharmacy and pharmacists have never been more important. Our retail pharmacy business is uniquely positioned to expand the role we play in the lives of our patients who have come to expect and need retail pharmacy at the center of their care.\r\nSo let me begin this discussion around our strategic decisions with our core business, US retail pharmacy. The success of the business hinges on an efficient, highly relevant customer experience, and we've launched a multifaceted action plan for improvement.\r\nAs the convenient destination for millions of customers and driving $27 billion of retail sales, the store and its digital channels are central to our strategy and consumer experience. But the customer has evolved. Demographics and preferences have shifted, and we need to reposition and operate our stores accordingly. Currently, 75% of our US stores contribute roughly 100% of segment AOI. For the remaining 25% of the stores in our network which are not currently contributing to our long-term strategy, changes are imminent.\r\nTo start, we are finalizing a multifactor store footprint optimization program, which we expect will include the closure of a significant portion of these underperforming stores over the next three years. Plans to finalize these number are in motion, and we will update you in due course.\r\nFor the remaining portion of this cohort, we are taking action to return them to profitability and deliver an improved customer experience. We will contemplate additional closures if performance does not improve, which includes external factors such as reimbursement rates.\r\nWhile it is not an easy decision to close a store, we will work to minimize customer disruptions. And importantly, as we have done in the past, we intend to redeploy the vast majority of the workforce in those stores that we close.\r\nIn addition to these closures, we are taking a series of actions and making investments to enhance the customer and patient experience across several key areas. First, we are reevaluating our assortment to ensure its relevancy, leveraging select partners and our own brands. This means we will work with fewer partners who are helping us win.\r\nFor example, in the last quarter alone, we've removed eight national brands and redeployed those SKUs towards own brands and preferred partners within health and wellness categories. We are sharpening our focus as a definition for areas we are uniquely positioned to lead such as health and beauty and women's health.\r\nWe are accelerating our digital and omnichannel offerings to meet our customers when, where, and how they want to engage. We continue to deliver approximately 80% of same-day delivery orders within one hour, and we see upside for improvement. As the ultra-convenient option for our over 120 million myWalgreens loyalty members, we have plans to meaningfully build our loyalty program. We are doubling down on our efforts to define the future of pharmacy in this country.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, this starts with changing the dialogue with payers and PBMs to ensure we are paid fairly for the value we provide. We're also investing in the industry's best talent. For example, as we focus on leading in the development and elevation of the pharmacy industry profession, we're partnering with critical stakeholders such as our Deans Advisory Council to help advance our work environment and make WBA the practice setting destination of choice for pharmacy talent.\r\nJust two weeks ago, we spent two full days with 14 deans of pharmacy across our country engaging in productive discussions to reinvigorate the community pharmacy labor supply chain. And we're enhancing our pharmacy services like immunizations to attract more patients to an improved experience and enhanced digital solutions. We've significantly decreased the average wait time per customer in the highest volume stores. And this is a result of several initiatives underway to improve the patient experience and increase retention.\r\nFinally, with a mindset for driving continuous improvement throughout the organization, we are committed to operating with excellence and identifying further efficiencies in both our headquarters and our retail operations. We are restructuring our organization around these conclusions to streamline and ensure efficient development and deployment of services, to go to market as one Walgreens with more impact for our industry partners and to help close critical gaps in delivery of healthcare.\r\nIn that regard, Mary Langowski, our President of US healthcare, will assume responsibility for operations of specialty pharmacy, pharma and manufacturer relations and contracting, supply chain, and all services development and deployment. With these operations now under one team, we will be better aligned to go where the market is moving, sharpen our contracting, operate more efficiently, and achieve better economic outcomes. And Rick Gates, our Chief Pharmacy Officer, will take on an even greater role in defining the future of pharmacy from a strategic, operational, and labor force perspective.\r\nTurning to our broader portfolio. We have evaluated every non-retail pharmacy asset prioritizing strategic fit, profit growth potential, and cash flow generation. With that in mind, we have already stopped or will stop initiatives that distract from our focus and will grow in areas that create longer-term shareholder value.\r\nLet me touch on several of our larger assets. Our review of Boots UK showed that we have attractive options to unlock value in this business. While we believe there is significant interest in Boots at the right time, its growth, strategic strength, and cash flow remain key contributors to the company. We are committed to continuing to invest in Boots UK and find innovative ways for this business to fulfill its potential.\r\nMoving next to VillageMD, which currently includes three distinct assets in VillageMD, Summit Health, and CityMD, we believe in the future of these businesses and intend to remain an investor and partner. But as part of our persistent focus on value creation for WBA, we are collaborating with leadership toward an endpoint to rapidly unlock liquidity, enhance optionality, and position them for additional growth.\r\nAs it relates to Shields, its performance, growth, and leadership team remain best-in-class and serve as a complement to our core specialty business in the market. We are not taking action at this time. We are committed to executing on all of these decisions in a timely manner that maximizes shareholder value while creating optionality, and I look forward to providing more details as we progress.\r\nBefore opening the call up for Q&A, let me leave you with four thoughts. First, our core retail pharmacy business is relevant but will be different. Second, we have the right team and the right strategy to enhance our focus, strengthen our own execution, and ultimately turn around the business performance.\r\nThird, there is a clear market need for our services, but our economics are not currently structured in a way that is sensible for our shareholders. We have a firm grasp of the issues and are working to address these challenges in our business model. Fourth, while it may take time, and there's a great deal of work underway, I am confident we are executing on the conclusions from our strategic review thoughtfully and urgently to deliver the Walgreens that our country needs. With that, let's begin Q&A. Operator?\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Lisa Gill, JPMorgan.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nThanks very much. And Tim, thanks for all the comments and the color. I really just want to understand just a couple of things a little bit better. One, you started with your four thoughts and that the core will be different than what we can say. So one, what do you view is the future of pharmacy? And within that, can you talk about the conversations that you're having with payers and PBMs around what the new reimbursement model would look like?\r\nAnd then just my second question would be, just when we think about the financial side, you called out NADAC pricing on Medicaid. And I think Manmohan said that it was $20 million in this quarter. Is that a material number when we think about going forward? If you can put any numbers around that would be great. Thanks.\n\nTimothy Wentworth\n\nThanks, Lisa. So big question, future pharmacy, I'll take quickly. And then I'll let Mary Langowski talk a little bit more detail about our payer conversations. Obviously, we won't get specific. But needless to say, they have, I think, changed both in tenor and content and are constructive. And then I'll let Manmohan talk about NADAC.\r\nAs far as the future of pharmacy, retail pharmacy in particular, which we talk about the store as part of an overall experience, we are working to essentially meet the consumer where they are today and where they need us to be. And there are a number of elements to that, both in the back of the store and in the front of the store.\r\nAnd so -- and I don't want to take as much time to take you in detail through all of those pieces. But at the front of the store, you saw us talk about footprint which leaves us a more rational investment horizon in terms of them bringing up to the standard that our customers would expect the store experience as well as the assortment that we would have for them, reducing our -- using almost a PBM-like approach to formulary to how we work with national brands, being deeper with fewer in order to both drive better economics and better outcomes for them as well as I saw yesterday a really exciting presentation on where we're taking our loyalty program.\r\nAnd so again, how we engage with our most valuable consumers as well as everything from home delivery, omnichannel and freeing up our store managers to really have flexibility in their framework, changing their compensation program dramatically in order to incent outcomes in their individual stores and have them act as owners. That's the front of the store.\r\nThe back of the store, we know, and Rick and the team have done a tremendous amount of work around automating the workload at the back of the store. As you know, we had paused our investment in backend automation, but we have pushed forward. We are continuing to drive and ultimately are highly committed to having that be a key part of how we both free up labor to do higher order things as well as be more efficient.\r\nAlso at the back of the store, the Deans Council, we spent two detailed days working with the deans of 15 pharmacy schools as well as the trade association -- or association of deans rather, looking deeply at community pharmacy is a preference, what we can do to be a leader in that space, design of -- we're talking about design of curricula, so these pharmacists come out of the school excited.\r\nAnd importantly, starting even as far back as middle school, to animate and excite sort of potential future pharmacists to the idea of community pharmacy where unlike hospital pharmacy, you have the opportunity to build long-term relationships with your patients. So the supply chain of labor, we're taking super seriously, both in terms of the effectiveness of it but also the size and the sort of skill set.\r\nOur contracting strategy is a key part of what we do in the back of the store, expansion of pharma services. I got an e-mail yesterday from the CEO of a major vaccine manufacturer, who again, wanted to make sure that we were on the edge of our seat getting excited about what their innovation was going to bring and how we were going to play a role in that.\r\nSo a lot there between the front and the back, but you don't need the number of stores we have today. We have a very clear picture of what we need to do there. We will have more details to follow. With that, I'll turn it over briefly to Mary to just go a little bit more color for you with the payer conversations that we've had, which I believe are highly constructive and then Manmohan.\n\nMary Langowski\n\nYeah. Thank you, Tim, and thank you, Lisa. Quite frankly, we are laser-focused on being paid fairly for the value we provide. And put simply, the playbook is a bit dated and does not account for nor does it adequately or fairly pay for the role and value that we think the pharmacist is bringing and delivering services.\r\nWe also don't think it accounts adequately for the complexity that we now face in the system. And it certainly doesn't facilitate putting pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions at the center of chronic disease management in this country. We think that has to change. And so we're collaborating with our PBM partners across the industry to make those changes.\n\nTimothy Wentworth\n\nAnd Manmohan?\n\nManmohan Mahajan\n\nYeah. Hi, Lisa. This -- so on NADAC, maybe a couple of thoughts. First, we've seen significant fluctuations in the last several months on the index itself. We had $20 million of impact in the quarter, but you got to think about that was a partial quarter impact. We have seen some improvement as the index, again, was updated in June. However, we are taking a very prudent approach as it relates to Q4 and the guidance for the year. And I'd say this is one of the reasons the fluctuations we've seen on NADAC is one of the reasons why we have the broader range as we put out the fiscal year guidance at this point.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nCharles Rhyee, TD Cowen.\n\nCharles Rhyee\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the questions. Tim, I wanted to touch a little bit more on the strategy to looking at this 25% of stores that are underperforming. And a lot of these are under probably long-term leases. And I'm just wondering sort of what your cash flow position is to be able to affect getting out of these leases perhaps earlier than intended.\r\nAnd maybe also when you look at these stores, how much of the underperformance is just purely a broad retail issue, just a weak consumer versus maybe stores that are facing higher levels of shrink? And thus, when you close those stores, does that solve a lot more of your margin problem all at once?\n\nTimothy Wentworth\n\nThanks, Charles. So I'll take the first part. As far as leases, one of the good news stories here is we actually opened stores over a long period of time that I think was widely acknowledged to be on the best corners in America. And so in many cases, as we close stores, we believe there is the opportunity to not simply carry the lease as a dark store over a period of time.\r\nAnd we are actually part of -- something I haven't talked about, but an underpinning of our strategic review is actually engaging in a different way as it relates to how we handle exits of stores and leases so that we actually have a much less probabilistic overhang as we look at those things. So we think actually -- you certainly do have some carry on the balance sheet for those leases over time. We think they can be minimized.\r\nWe're actually going back and looking at leases that we had already sort of just taken as dark because we think there's gold in them. They're hills, as they say. So from that standpoint, we're going to be highly disciplined on the leases, and that's part of our underlying economic analysis of what stores to close as well.\r\nSo it needs to be clear that, that is a multifactor analysis, super detailed and that is one of the elements of it. As far as what sort of the profitability impact is and the underlying dynamics that might cause a store to -- or the underlying benefit of closing a store, I'll let Tracey Brown, who obviously is president of our stores, talk a bit more about that because it is -- that's also not as simple as just high shrink stores, for example. Tracey?\n\nTracey Brown\n\nYeah. Thank you, Tim, and thank you, Charles. So as Tim has mentioned, this is a multi-factored disciplined way of looking at where to close. Yes, shrink is an issue in some stores, but we have our eyes on our high shrink stores all the time.\r\nThe second thing is consumer behavior, consumer trends and where you look at the markets and where our stores are located in terms of the markets that are growing versus the markets that are declining. Third, you actually have to look at like the competitive landscape in each of these markets. And then the fourth thing that I would say is we are actually looking at how we are actually leveraging our assortment in these markets.\r\nSo there are multiple levers that we look at that go into the model that drive underperformance. The other thing that I will say is there are stores that would be on this bubble. We're also taking a focused approach on those stores to get them in the right context.\r\nAnd I guess the last thing that I would say, Charles, this is a multi-level set of factors that come into play between ourselves, between local state officials, between law enforcement. There are a lot of players in these markets that need to partner with us in order to make sure that we are growing those that need to grow. And those that are not, we're taking the appropriate action.\n\nTimothy Wentworth\n\nYeah. Let me just add to that, because that is such an important point from a policy in our country standpoint. The fact of the matter is, we know that we are the last company standing in a lot of places. We are the only thing standing between those places and being pharmacy deserts.\r\nAnd our goal is not simply to be the last one to leave. Our goal is to actually find new ways to work together, whether it's with state Medicaid programs, whether it's a local law enforcement, and so forth for them to do their jobs so that we can do our jobs and continue to provide care in those communities.\n\nCharles Rhyee\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nEric Percher, Nephron Research.\n\nEric Percher\n\nThank you. Two related questions relative to the gross margin in the pharmacy. And I think, first, if we look at the retail gross margin, it appears to be at a low point relative to the last 10 years. Can you give us a bit more on the discounting that you engaged in and your expectation for that through the fourth quarter and how you expect it to taper?\r\nAnd then the second part is looking at NADAC, if it was $20 million over a month and change and you're saying conservative over the second or this full quarter, are you assuming that there's still more expansion as it flows from Medicaid to commercial? Or do you think we can -- we've kind of seen the peak in this one or month and change?\n\nTimothy Wentworth\n\nSure. I'm going to pass it to Manmohan in just a second. What I'd say is, first of all, as it relates to commercial and NADAC, I believe what Rick would say if I passed it over to him, would be that while we do have some commercial contracts that use NADAC, those conversations we're having around sort of neutrality in terms of outcomes, that's actually the easier part of NADAC, quite frankly.\r\nAs it relates to the gross margin in pharmacy, I will pass it to Manmohan. And as I quickly would point out, gross margin is not only discounting. It is also mix and so forth. And so Manmohan, if you want to talk more about that?\n\nManmohan Mahajan\n\nYeah, sure. So as you think about the gross margin on the retail pharmacy side, maybe a couple of things there. Let me start on the retail side. And what we've experienced in the third quarter, and we think the trend is going to continue in Q4 is the environment didn't improve as we anticipated. And as a result, we focused on investing in price and promotion.\r\nNow we've seen the unit and sales uplift as a result thereof, but at the same time, there was impact on gross margin in the short term. And so that is coming through, and we expect that's going to continue along the same lines in Q4.\r\nThe second piece that does impact our gross margin year-over-year is the level of shrink. And I think we talked about shrink in last couple of calls as well. We have seen it on an increasing trends, and there are a number of actions that Tracey and the team are taking to bring it back to historical normals.\r\nOn the pharmacy side then on the margin, a couple of themes playing out. NADAC is one of them, significant fluctuation as I said earlier in the call. We have seen some level of improvement as the index itself changed in June. But as I said, we're -- at this point, the level of fluctuations we have seen month-over-month, we're just being prudent in terms of what can play out here in Q4.\r\nOutside of that, there last to -- last point I'd say there are some market dynamics that we experienced in Q3 as well and some will play in Q4. And maybe a couple of those to point out is there are certain generic launches where the procurement dynamics continues to be just like branded. And so that is impacting our gross margin on the pharmacy side. And then lastly, I'd say the mix that's coming in on the branded side is also having a negative impact on the margin. So that's maybe overall profile of what's driving our margin in the quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nAnn Hynes, Mizuho Securities.\n\nAnn Hynes\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you. I have two questions. One is just about your commentary around prescriptions and not back to pre-pandemic level. I guess I find that a little surprising just because overall healthcare utilization is so strong. So do you think it's a market share issue? Is it a pharmacist issue?\r\nI know you lost some pharmacies during the pandemic. Maybe if you can provide some updates on that. I know you mentioned Medicaid, but it was my understanding Medicaid's pretty small as a percentage of total revenue. So any other detail would be great.\r\nAnd then my second question is just, I guess, bigger picture. I know you're not giving all the details on the strategic review, but your stocks down a lot premarket. Like do you have a sense for maybe some of your longer-term investors when you think you could stabilize operating profit in the retail segment and free cash flow, is it like a 2026 timeframe? Like any update on the timeframe when you think you can recover this business would be great. Thanks.\n\nTimothy Wentworth\n\nSure. And by the way, we share the same goal that your second question implicitly implies, which is to be very clear, as you've heard us say or let me make sure you hear us say, we actually have a really strong level of conviction around the core business that we are remodeling here. It will be very different Walgreens in a lot of ways, different experience.\r\nBut by the same token, we see a clear stabilization and actual growth path for that business. It is going to take time. We're not going to give you a guidance but it's quarters, not months. It's not necessarily multiple years, but it is probably a period of time that we will have to demonstrate to you and frankly, to our consumer that we are going to deserve their preference.\r\nAs it relates to the share dynamics and sort of why share is growing more slowly. And you're right, it's not just Medicaid, although that does impact things, the Medicaid re-enrollment challenges. By the way, which many of our urban stores could have played a role in if we were to have a closer relationship with Medicaid, and we are having some of those discussions do -- is one factor. But Rick, do you want to talk more broadly?\n\nRick Gates\n\nYeah, Ann. And I think as you look at volume, I think we stated that we are growing with market right now. So it's not just a Walgreens thing. It is a market dynamic. And so when you look at Medicaid redetermination as an example, Medicaid enrollment really ballooned during the pandemic as obviously they were not moving people outside of the Medicaid coverage.\r\nAnd so what we've seen is that states has continued to move patients out. We're seeing upwards of closer to 18 million to 20 million individuals who have moved out of Medicaid coverage and either have to go out and find coverage like either discount cards, individual plans, or get into commercial plans. And so we've seen a dynamic where they actually have not picked up coverage as quickly, and utilization has dropped.\r\nAnd so what I think we're seeing is that pandemic, we were running closer to 4%, 4.5% towards the end of it from a market growth perspective. Pre-pandemic, it was closer to 2.5%. And I think what we're seeing right now is we're actually running below the 2.5% from a market perspective. And obviously, we're trying to track with that.\n\nOperator\n\nKevin Caliendo, UBS.\n\nKevin Caliendo\n\nThanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to expand on Charles' question a little bit. If we were to just do simple math of the stores that you've identified, the 25% stores, and let's just say those stores were gone as of today, what would be the financial impact on the company right now? Like what would be the change in terms of your gross profit or your EBIT, however, you want to define it?\r\nAnd then the follow-up to that is, of those 25% stores, I appreciate you calling out that you expect to retain most of the workforce, what is the expectation on the retention of Rx, of the scripts in those stores, meaning usually when you close a store or relocate a store, you oftentimes are able to keep a vast majority of those scripts. Has there been an analysis of that done yet? Thank you.\n\nTimothy Wentworth\n\nThanks for the question. I'll take the second half, which is absolutely, that's a key part of the analysis and underlying assumptions that we have experience with. Obviously, as you may know, we've been closing multiple hundreds of stores over the last several years.\r\nAnd we've gotten very good at being able to not only move those scripts and those patients more importantly, but also to predict sort of what the drop-off would be based on certain circumstances. So it is a key part of the analysis. The short answer is we retain nearly all of them, not all of them necessarily, but nearly all of them and certainly in a way that makes the underlying overall economics of closing the store makes sense.\r\nAs it relates to essentially a pro forma of what the business looks like with all of that gone, which would be fairly complex because of a number of factors that you have to assume and that we have assumed but we wouldn't want to necessarily put out there as guidance right now, I'll let Manmohan talk a bit more though about those dynamics.\n\nManmohan Mahajan\n\nYeah, sure. So look, I think from an analytics perspective, as we think through the closure, maybe two points there. 25% is the overall footprint that we're evaluating. And as Tim mentioned, it's not that all of them are for closure.\r\nSo we're going through the detailed analysis store by store, where we can improve the performance and bring them back into the portfolio and what's the remaining part where we need to take the action. Now Tracey mentioned a number of -- several factors that go into our determination of where we need to take the action.\r\nI'd say maybe I focus on the financial side. It's really driven -- it comes down to the cash flow analysis, it's cash flow positive to keep it open or cash flow positive to close. And the decision to close typically would result in accretion, both on the cash as well as on the adjusted EPS side.\r\nAnd then so far as retention is concerned, yeah, I think Tim covered that as well. We've closed 2,000 locations over the last 10 years. So at this point, I think we have a pretty good view of -- depending upon the location of the stores, what would be the retention on the script side.\n\nTimothy Wentworth\n\nYeah. And let me be clear about one additional thing. We are extremely focused on the fact that closing those stores means we have to reduce our fixed costs that support those stores as well. So if you're trying to model it, what you would need to do is assume some percentage of stores and then back out the fixed cost because we will be highly disciplined at ensuring that any fixed costs that are being carried by those stores are also removed, which is what makes closing the stores in part very attractive.\n\nOperator\n\nMichael Cherny, Leerink Partners.\n\nMichael Cherny\n\nGood morning and thanks for taking the question. So I don't want to get too far ahead of this reboot plan, but Tim, you talked about 25% of the stores in the strategic review that you've outlined. How do you feel comfortable that, that's the right number of stores to be evaluated?\r\nAnd in the event that we play this forward in -- let's say, you close 25% of the stores, how will you be judging about whether or not that's the appropriate footprints to give the right coverage for payers, to give the right localized coverage to your point to retain the scripts that you like? I'm just trying to get a sense of a little more detail on how you landed most of that number and why we should sit here today thinking that is the right number.\n\nTimothy Wentworth\n\nSure. I would tell you that we have not only ourselves using our models, but used a very aggressive outside firm that brings incredibly thoughtful models to the table and have done this in other scenarios to challenge our thinking.\r\nAnd so listen, there's no one exact right number. Let's be clear. There are group of stores that are clear. There are a group of stores that we will be working to see whether or not they make sense. And one of the factors that we actually factor in is our payer mix.\r\nBut I also want to be clear, this industry has been reducing its capacity over the last several years, and that is not a bad thing. I think most of us knew when I was in the PBM business, I knew that retail pharmacy was largely overbuilt for where the future was going to be, particularly given the possibility of technology, home delivery and so forth.\r\nAnd so for us, that's another factor as well as the number of stores we may need to serve a particular payer today may be very different than what it would have been 10 years ago. I mean, if you look at the Department of Defense as a contracting entity, they have minimum standards. And they're very tough, and they don't require 70,000 pharmacies, let's be clear, in their network.\r\nSo we think that reducing capacity in the industry is not a bad thing. We think it's good for the labor so that we're not actually overusing pharmacists in stores that we don't need. But we also think that from a payer standpoint, we are going to be positioned to serve payers very effectively with the footprint that remains.\n\nOperator\n\nElizabeth Anderson, Evercore ISI.\n\nElizabeth Anderson\n\nHi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I have maybe a short-term one and then maybe sort of a longer-term one. On this year, obviously, you had a nice quarter-over-quarter improvement in free cash flow. Can you help us think about sort of the free cash flow expectations for the fourth quarter? And then sort of maybe anything you can say directionally on 2025?\r\nAnd then as we think about some of these payer conversations that you've been having, I mean, have any of the payers sort of agreed to terms that kind of help stabilize things for, I don't know, starting 1/1/'25? Is this like more of a longer-term kind of conversation? Any other color you could provide on that side would be very helpful. Thank you.\n\nTimothy Wentworth\n\nSure. So I'll turn it over to Manmohan for the free cash flow conversation, and then Mary to give you any color on payer conversations. What I would remind you of is that we're fairly -- we're right in the middle of those conversations now. It wouldn't be appropriate to necessarily characterize any one of them, but they're super encouraging. And I think Mary can talk a little bit more about that at this juncture. But Manmohan, do you want to talk about the cash flow?\n\nManmohan Mahajan\n\nSure. So from a third quarter perspective, we did have positive free cash flows in the quarter, and that was aided in part by the working capital improvements in the quarter as well as decreased capital expenditures. As you think about the first nine months of the year, though, the cash flows are impacted by lower earnings and then $785 million of payments related to legal matters as well as the phasing on the working capital.\r\nAs we think through Q4, we expect Q4 free cash flows to be positive, similar to third quarter. And that is including a roughly around $150 million payment related to opioid in the quarter. And then maybe finally, I'd say, look, this is a top priority for us in the company. And all the actions we've outlined and -- we'll continue to boost the cash flow position here.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\n\nTimothy Wentworth\n\nAnd then Mary? Sorry, I'll let Mary take the piece around (multiple speakers) characterizing our conversations.\n\nMary Langowski\n\nRight, I won't speak to specific payer conversations. But I will say that there is an understanding and a collaboration going on that some of these models need to change, and we're reshaping our current negotiations on brand versus generic reimbursement and obviously, in discussions on some of these new models, new payment models that are out there. We, I think, are seeing an understanding that we need to align incentives better. And just as I said before that the old playbook is old, and it's not currently serving the system.\n\nElizabeth Anderson\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nGeorge Hill, Deutsche Bank.\n\nGeorge Hill\n\nGood morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. I just kind of have a quick one for Manmohan. You talked about the $0.75 of earnings contribution in fiscal '24 that wasn't expected to continue. And you guys have talked about the challenges in fiscal '24 in retail pharmacy kind of expected to persist in fiscal '25.\r\nI know you guys aren't ready to give full year 2025 guidance yet, but I just want to make sure, are we kind of talking about an earnings number in the low $2 range, given where the current fiscal '24 guidance is? And I guess, I mean how would be, is there -- are there any other like moving pieces as it relates to cash flow for fiscal '25 that you guys would call out now? Thank you.\n\nManmohan Mahajan\n\nYeah, sure, George. So on the earnings for fiscal '25, you're right, we're not providing guidance. But we will come back and provide detailed information and guidance in October.\r\nBut what we offered in the prepared remarks is a couple of things to consider as you bridge to '25. First is Q4 seasonality impacts all of our businesses, and you think about vaccinations, you think about cough-cold season, you think about the season -- the holiday season impacting the retail sales. So seasonality drives Q4 to be our -- typically our lowest quarter, and so you got to consider that.\r\nAnd second is, we do expect profitability growth, both in our US healthcare segment as well as in our international segment as we move into fiscal '25. However, said that, there are a few headwinds. And the biggest one here is as we think about our decision to wind down the sale-leaseback program, sale of Cencora shares, and then you consider a more normalized tax rate into fiscal '25 that we believe will result in approximately $0.75 headwind.\r\nAnd then on the retail side, you have to consider -- we do believe the environment will continue to be challenging here in '25 from a consumer perspective, but there is a little bit of easing comparisons as you think about '24 versus '25. And on the pharmacy side, some of these headwinds will continue as you think through this. So this is -- these are all kind of the building blocks as you work through modeling '25.\n\nGeorge Hill\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nStephanie Davis, Barclays.\n\nStephanie Davis\n\nHey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I have a question, this might be best for Mary, but maybe, Tim, I'd love for you to weigh in on the future of the US healthcare strategy. Just given the plan to exit VillageMD and the idea that value-based strategies often take a few years in order to get profitable versus some of your near-term profitability goals, what's the forward take on the need to be in the value-based strategy for the best of US healthcare? And could we see this become more of a fee-for-service asset going forward?\n\nTimothy Wentworth\n\nYeah. I will let Mary -- I would remind all the listeners, Mary joined about three months ago and brings tremendous experience and relationships in this space, understands it well. And I want to be clear, we are big believers in value-based healthcare.\r\nActually, pharmacy is the value-based healthcare provider in the ecosystem, quite frankly, if you really look at cost for outcomes and the work that we can do to impact those outcomes. So we love the fact that we actually own what will be seen over the next 20 years and needed as the most valuable part of the healthcare ecosystem and frankly, the most accessible. That's number one.\r\nNumber two, as it relates to VillageMD in that model, we like that model. That's why we've said we would continue to have some investment and that's participate in their growth. It will take time. And as I said, we are looking for a different horizon for what we're going to be investing in strategically under our own leadership. But Mary, do you want to talk more generally about sort of that question as it relates to US healthcare strategy and Village -- fee-for-service versus value?\n\nMary Langowski\n\nYeah, absolutely. Thanks, Stephanie. In the US healthcare business, we are laser-focused on being extremely disciplined around where we will focus, what we will do, and importantly, what we'll stop doing. So there are areas where we'll grow and double down. And those areas fit the lens Tim articulated earlier.\r\nThose things have high-growth potential. They build on our core business. We're streamlining how we operate as we discussed around going to market with higher impact, how we develop services, and how we partner across the industry with payers, health systems, at-risk providers as well as pharma manufacturers.\r\nAnd then third, we'll stop things. And frankly, we already have stopped certain things that don't fit this lens or create near-term value. In some cases, we'll exit or restructure those things. So it's important that we stay really laser-focused on that.\r\nWith respect to value-based care, we have already articulated that we don't have plans to continue to invest in brick-and-mortar owned primary care practices. Now having said that, we believe strongly, as Tim said, in value-based care as well as in VillageMD. And we believe in these businesses and payers believe in these businesses, and consumers, frankly, love getting their care in these types of businesses.\r\nBut what we've stated, and I'll state again is we'll be a partner of VillageMD in an ongoing way. We'll continue to be an investor. But what we're really looking to do is invest in capital-light services to be a broader partner across the industry with a range of providers and with a range of payers as well as a range of pharmaceutical manufacturers.\r\nAnd we think we're really well positioned to do that, particularly based on the conversations we've already been having over the last three months. We are very complementary to a lot of players in the system. And they, frankly, want what we have that they don't have, which is reach -- our ability to reach people, our ability to engage them, and our ability to create interventions in really critical moments. So that's what we're planning to do.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tim Wentworth for closing remarks.\n\nTimothy Wentworth\n\nGreat. Thanks, everyone, for the questions and for dialing in. Just to leave you with a couple of thoughts. First of all, our team is very clear that we are in a turnaround. We have a clear-eyed view of the things we need to do. We have gone very deep in understanding every part of this business and being realistic about the baseline we're resetting for growth.\r\nSecond, we have a team that is literally, I believe, one of the best teams any company could ever have. I am extremely blessed to work with a group of folks who not only work effectively together but are relentlessly focused on the challenge and most importantly, highly committed and believe in the future of our business, the retail pharmacy experience that patients and payers and pharma companies need us to be.\r\nRetail pharmacy is central to the future of the experience that we're going to create and the growth that we will have. It is necessary, but it will be different. And over the coming quarters, we look forward to showing you as well as telling you how it will be different and the kind of results that it will achieve in a more capital-friendly way.\r\nAnd finally, we are very clear about our role as stewards of capital and making investments that make sense. We have some great assets that are part of our company today. We're going to be thoughtful about how we continue to improve the value of those assets or do other things that make sense based on our longer-term strategy. So thanks again. We look forward to sharing more in the coming quarters.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy Under $50. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) stands against the other healthcare stocks under $50. If interested, you can also read our recent article on the 10 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nAccording to Michael Adams, the Lead Editor of Investing at Forbes, investments in healthcare stocks provide investors with consistent and steady returns because of the defensive nature of these stocks. No matter what the economic situation or direction of the stock market, people will always need healthcare and medical services.\n\nThe healthcare industry is thriving in the United States. A recent report highlighted a 7.5% increase in healthcare spending in the country in 2023, which was higher than the nominal GDP growth rate during the same year. The percentage of Americans with health insurance reached a record high of 93.1%, contributing to the high growth in healthcare expenditure last year. Between 2023 and 2032, the national healthcare spending in the United States is projected to grow at an average of 5.6% and outpace the GDP growth which is forecast at 4.3%.\n\nThe industry is steadily expanding globally as well. Recent predictions by McKinsey anticipate healthcare profits to grow from $583 billion in 2022 to a total of over $800 billion by 2027, at a CAGR of 7%. While the industry remained under pressure in 2023 due to labor shortages and high inflation rates, 2024 is poised to be a year of recovery due to a favorable risk-reward environment in the industry. The American investment firm believes that the events of 2023 have created an attractive opening for investors to spend in the healthcare sector.\n\nInvestments in artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare have also surged over the last few years, growing at twice the pace of the tech industry, according to a report released by the Silicon Valley Bank this month. The story also stated that one in every four dollars spent in the healthcare sector goes to companies that are leveraging artificial intelligence. Already, an estimated $2.8 billion has been invested in AI healthcare corporations in 2024, with the Silicon Valley Bank expecting over $11 billion to be deployed in the sector this year.\n\nDeloitte\u2019s 2024 Global Health Care Sector Outlook has also mentioned that investor confidence in the healthcare sector remains high. Between 2019 and 2022, private equity funding worth $31.5 billion was invested in the sector. A large number of companies are incorporating artificial intelligence into their operations in the United States which has the potential to save around $360 billion in the country\u2019s healthcare industry over the next five years. AI is likely to play a significant role in the foreseeable future in patient care, diagnosis, treatment, and medical administration. The automation of health records and the use of predictive analytics are set to further enhance the efficiency of healthcare providers and their services.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you have made up your mind to invest in the healthcare sector and want to start small, stay with us as we shift our focus now to the best healthcare stocks to buy under $50.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe went through the stock screeners for NASDAQ and NYSE to find healthcare stocks that had a current share price of less than $50 and then looked up those stocks on Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 920 hedge funds as of Q1 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of number of hedge fund holders in each company.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA pharmacist discussing the health benefits of a prescription medication with a customer.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 41\n\nShare Price: $15.66\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) has had a difficult past year, with its share price declining 52% during the year. In fact, it has been a tough decade, with the company\u2019s share losing 75% of its value over the last 10 years. The company has been greatly hurt by reimbursement pressures in the industry as pharmacy benefit management companies (PBMs) push to bring down reimbursement rates related to health insurance customers.\n\nThat said, investors remain confident about the company turning things around amid measures taken by the incumbent management. According to Insider Monkey, 41 hedge fund holders remain optimistic about the company. Ariel Appreciation Fund shared the following remarks about Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\nShares of retail drugstore operator, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), declined over the period as challenging consumer and macroeconomic conditions, ongoing operational issues and a significant cut in the dividend weighed on shares. To address these performance lows, WBA\u2019s new CEO is rebuilding the company\u2019s management team with leaders who have significant experience in healthcare services. Meanwhile, WBA continues to execute on its cost-savings initiatives to optimize profitability and is using excess capital to prioritize the sustainability of its operations and balance sheet. Over the medium term, we expect a re-rating in shares as the new executive team earns credibility, margins, and free cash flow shows signs of improvement and the company deleverages. WBA shares are currently trading at a significant discount to our estimate of private market value.\n\nOverall WBA ranks 6th on our list of the best healthcare stocks to buy under $50.

While we acknowledge the potential of WBA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Multibillion-pound sale of Boots is shelved after shares plunge in US parent company",
        "content": "boots pharmacy\n\nThe struggling US owner of Boots has shelved plans for a multibillion-pound sale for the second time, leaving the high street chemist at risk of a further squeeze on investment in its stores.\n\nWalgreens, which has owned Boots since 2014, abandoned plans to cash in as it revealed a damaging profit warning on Wednesday.\n\nThe trading update, which also announced plans to close a large number of stores, saw its share price fall to its lowest level since 1997.\n\nBoots was an isolated bright spot for the $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) group, and chief executive Tim Wentworth said he would retain ownership of the retailer as he attempts to overhaul the business.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said: \u201cOur review of Boots UK showed that we have attractive options to unlock value in this business.\n\n\u201cWhile we believe there is significant interest in Boots at the right time, its growth, strategic strength and cashflow remain key contributors to the company.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to continuing to invest in Boots UK and find innovative ways for this business to fulfil its potential.\u201d\n\nThe decision will spark fears that Boots stores could face closure or miss out on upgrades. Walgreens has already shut 650 Boots stores in the UK and has faced criticism from staff and customers for underinvestment.\n\nIt will also fuel speculation over the future of chief executive Seb James, who has been at the helm since 2018 and had previously been promoting the retailer\u2019s chances of listing in London.\n\nBosses at Walgreens said Boots\u2019 stores remain \u201ckey contributors\u201d to the business. In its latest update, Walgreens said overall sales at Boots were up 1.6pc over the third quarter, while digital purchases were up 13.8pc year on year.\n\nHowever, this was not enough to prevent Walgreens from slashing its profit forecast for the year, which led to its share price tumbling by 25pc \u2013 its biggest one-day fall since 1980.\n\nThis led to the company announcing plans to close a significant number of underperforming stores in the US as it scrambles to cut costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, the group announced plans to find cost savings of up to $1bn, which consists of a commitment to close around 650 Boots stores in the UK. It said 484 have already been shuttered as of February this year, leaving it with 1,900 in total.\n\nOverall, Walgreens recorded sales of $36.4bn over the past three months, which represented an increase of 2.5pc.\n\nThat was despite retail sales falling by 4pc amid a \u201cchallenging US retail environment\u201d.\n\nMr Wentworth said, said: \u201cThe bottom line is that I am confident that [Walgreens] will be a leader in the future of healthcare with pharmacy and retail at its centre.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we also acknowledge where we are today, and what we need to do to realise our longer-term ambitions. The severity and duration of the challenges in the operating environment have only added urgency.\u201d\n\nWalgreens first bought the 175-year-old business in 2014 and had previously attempted to offload it in 2022.\n\nSale plans were then reignited earlier this year, with Mr Wentworth claiming in January that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d regarding the future of Boots.\n\nA City investment banker said private equity firms have been looking at Boots for the past few months, particularly as the prospect of a London listing fell away. However, they described the retailer as an unattractive proposition given its vast real estate portfolio.\n\n\u201cWhat do you do with all that space?\u201d the banker said, who stressed that a large number of stores would require significant investment.\n\nAnother City banker said: \u201cThe question all buyers were asking was what has changed since last time. And the short answer is, not a lot.\u201d",

        "content": "Walgreens' (WBA) quarterly results are the latest sign that US consumers are increasingly under pressure.\n\nShares of Walgreens Boots Alliance tanked 24% on Thursday after the retail pharmacy chain lowered its full-year guidance due to challenging pharmacy industry trends and a \"worse-than-expected\u201d consumer environment, with management citing \"a sustained pullback\" in discretionary spending.\n\n\u201cIn US Retail pharmacy, we witness continued pressure on the US Consumer. Our customers have become increasingly selective and price-sensitive in their purchases,\u201d CEO Tim Wentworth told analysts during the company's earnings call on Thursday morning.\n\nThe company is the latest retailer to call out a more cautious consumer amid an environment of persistently sticky inflation and high interest rates. The pharmacy chain's quarterly report comes as the Federal Reserve weighs when and how quickly to begin cutting interest rates. Any cracks in the economy could prompt the central bank to act sooner rather than later. Its most recent forecast was for one cut this year.\n\nWalgreens expects adjusted earnings per share for the year to come in between $2.80 and $2.95, down from its prior forecast of $3.20 to $3.35.\n\nA challenging consumer backdrop has prompted Walgreens to lower prices across health and wellness, personal care, and seasonal categories.\n\nJeff Jonas, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, told Yahoo Finance he expects other pharmacy companies like CVS (CVS) to face similar consumer headwinds.\n\n\u201cWith higher prices at the pharmacy, consumers aren\u2019t paying that anymore. They\u2019re going to Amazon, they\u2019re going to Costco or Walmart. So that\u2019s forcing the pharmacies to cut price on a lot of those front [of] store items, which directly hurts the profit margins.\u201d\n\nRetail sales data for May revealed that the pace of consumer spending is cooling down from last year, a sign that high interest rates and inflation are weighing on consumers.\n\nLast month, Home Depot's CEO signaled the home improvement retailer's results were \"impacted by a delayed start to spring and continued softness in certain larger discretionary projects.\"\n\nAlso in May, Starbucks' (SBUX) stock sank nearly 16% during one session after the coffee giant missed its quarterly results, with same-store sales in the US dropping 3% versus Wall Street expectations for a gain of just over 2%.\n\nStretched consumers have gotten pickier in the grocery aisles as well, recently leading to weaker current quarter expectations from meat giant Tyson Foods (TSN).\n\nStory continues General Mills headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, May 5, 2023.

far ahead in opinion polls - would likely lay out tough spending plans for the next few years in its autumn budget, but did not expect major tax hikes to be included other than \u201cmodest measures\u201d, such as on private school fees.\n\n\u201cThen, provided the economy is okay, they will gradually add to their public spending plans in subsequent years, while staying well within the fiscal rules,\u201d he said.\n\n04:23 PM BST\n\nUyghur group wins appeal over UK probe into \u2018slave labour\u2019 cotton\n\nBritish authorities must reconsider whether to open a probe into the importation of cotton allegedly produced by slave labour in the Chinese region of Xinjiang, a London court ruled on Thursday, allowing an appeal by a Uyghur rights group.\n\nThe World Uyghur Congress, an international organisation of exiled Uyghur groups, took legal action against Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA) after it declined to begin a criminal investigation.\n\nBeijing vigorously denies any abuses. \u201cThe Chinese government has made it very clear that the allegation of \u2018forced labour\u2019 in Xinjiang is nothing but an enormous lie propagated by anti-China elements to smear China,\u201d a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London said.\n\nIn its legal action, the World Uyghur Congress argued that the NCA wrongly failed to investigate whether cotton from Xinjiang amounts to \u201ccriminal property\u201d.\n\nLast year, a judge at London\u2019s High Court ruled there was \u201cclear and undisputed evidence of instances of cotton being manufactured ... by the use of detained and prison labour as well as by forced labour\u201d.\n\nBut the legal challenge was dismissed on the grounds that the British authorities\u2019 approach to the law \u2013 which was that there has to be a clear link between alleged criminality and a specific product \u2013 was correct.\n\nThe Court of Appeal overturned that decision, ruling that \u201cthe question of whether to carry out an investigation ... will be remitted to the NCA for reconsideration\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for the NCA said: \u201cWe respectfully note the judgment of the Court of Appeal and are considering our next steps.\u201d\n\n04:17 PM BST\n\nWestern tariffs a \u2018challenge\u2019 for China\u2019s battery giant\n\nAn executive from China\u2019s battery giant CATL said on Thursday that Western tariffs tied to electric vehicles present a \u201cchallenge\u201d for the firm, and are bad for customers too.\n\nThe European Union is due to impose hefty tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars by July 4, after Washington increased duties on the sector last month.\n\nCanada suggested this week it might also follow suit.\n\nCATL is a major player in the market as the world\u2019s top producer of electric vehicle batteries, having signed deals with carmakers including Tesla, Stellantis and BMW.\n\nNi Jun, CATL\u2019s chief manufacturing officer, said:\n\nI will say this is a challenge ...\n\nI believe [the tariffs are] not good for the consumer ...\n\nWhether you are a European consumer or Asian consumer, we want to have affordable product, high quality, (that) can save the planet.\n\nCATL has been helped by robust financial support from Beijing, which has prioritised the development of domestic high-tech industries that it views as strategically advantageous.\n\n04:11 PM BST\n\nKemi Badenoch accuses Labour of wanting to micromanage business\n\nThe Business Secretary, Kemi Badenoch, has launched an attack on Labour\u2019s plans to \u201cmicro-manage\u201d businesses and promote identity politics in the world of work.\n\nIn a speech to the British Chambers of Commerce, she criticised Labour for wanting mandatory reporting on ethnicity pay gaps - even though the Conservatives have already introduced gender pay gap reporting.\n\nShe said that 70 new regulations would create lots of jobs for compliance consultants and keep employment tribunals busy, but would not promote growth.\n\nShe said:\n\nTheir vision of the future economy is one that micro-manages your business to meet their political objectives. That includes the divisive agenda of identity politics ...\n\nIn their manifesto they say they will enshrine in law the full right to equal pay for ethnic minorities. But you know and I know we already have laws that do that.\n\nThis is going to be much more political.\n\nA law that will be used to work out what people of different ethnicities should be paid.\n\nAnd they\u2019ll be checking on you.\n\nIn 2016, the Conservative administration commissioned Tory peer Baroness McGregor-Smith to produce a report on ethnicity in the workplace. It recommended mandatory ethnical pay gap reporting. However, the Governement decided to instead provide guidance to support employers who wished to report the gap voluntarily.\n\n03:54 PM BST\n\nLevi drops 17pc amid wafer-thin profits\n\nShares of Levi Strauss are down 17pc today after issuing disappointing quarterly results last night, which failed to hit market expectations.\n\nThe company reported a wafer-thin profit of $18m on net revenues of $1.4bn, compared with a loss of $2m a year earlier.\n\nLevi is pivoting to a direct-to-consumer business and prioritising higher-margin products after an inventory glut last year caused several quarters of weakness in wholesale demand.\n\nIn the reported quarter, Levi\u2019s US wholesale revenue was down mid-single digits, although the company added the channel was \u201csignificantly more profitable\u201d than last year due to improved inventory levels.\n\n\u201cOur consumer is proving to be resilient. They\u2019re coming into our stores and they\u2019re shopping online.

The companies have dealt with challenges that include years of low margins on prescriptions and rising costs for running their shops.\n\nAnalysts say they have also been hit by growing competition from Walmart supermarkets, Amazon and other discount retailers over sales of non-prescription products.\n\nTim Wentworth, chief executive, said that the company continues to face challenges that include \u201cpersistent pressure on the US consumer.\u201d\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance runs about 12,500 pharmacies worldwide, including more than 8,600 locations in the United States. Boots has 2,100 stores in the UK.\n\nMr Wentworth said that \u00a0\u201cchanges are imminent\u201d for about 25pc of the company\u2019s US stores, which could include closing of a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of them.\n\nThe company said profits were $344m (\u00a3272m) in the three months to May 31.

The Wall Street Journal reported the closings would take place over the next few years, but CNBC\u2019s Bertha Coombs reported it could take place over the next few quarters.\n\nNearly a quarter of all Walgreens stores are not profitable, the company said. Many of those are in urban areas. The company said workers at affected stores would be offered positions in other locations and it did not expect the closures to impact its employee count.\n\n\"We continue to face a difficult operating environment, including persistent pressures on the U.S. consumer and the impact of recent marketplace dynamics which have eroded pharmacy margins,\u201d said CEO Tim Wentworth in a statement. \u201cOur results and outlook reflect these headwinds, despite solid performance in both our International and U.S. Healthcare segments. \u2026 We are addressing critical issues with urgency and working to unlock opportunities for growth. Many of these actions will take time.\u201d\n\nWalgreens stock was hammered Thursday on the news, as well as due to third-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations and news the company was cutting its profit outlook for the full year, saying the environment for pharmacies was \"challenging.\" Earnings per share came in at 63 cents, compared to an expected 68 cents.\n\nWalgreens is a staple in many cities, but has been under pressure of late from online pharmacies run by entities ranging from Amazon to Mark Cuban. Staffing shortages have also made it challenging for the company.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. slashed its guidance due to a worsening retail environment and announced it would close significantly more stores as its new chief executive officer seeks to turn the business around.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSupreme Court Poised to Allow Emergency Abortions in Idaho Bolivia\u2019s President Arce Swears in New Army Chief After Coup Bid SpaceX Tender Offer Said to Value Company at Record $210 Billion China\u2019s Finance Elite Face $400,000 Pay Cap, Bonus Clawbacks YouTuber Dr Disrespect Was Allegedly Kicked Off Twitch for Messaging Minor\n\nWalgreens said Thursday that in addition to the store closures, they would make more organizational changes, without specifying further job cuts. The company has had a rocky few years with turnover in the executive ranks amid a challenging retail climate.\n\nWalgreens shares sank as much as 24% when markets opened in New York, their biggest one-day decline since at least 1980, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. CVS was also down as much as 5.6%.\n\nThe store closures will take place over the next three years, Chief Executive Officer Tim Wentworth said on a call with analysts. The total number is not finalized, he said, adding \u201cwe will update you in due course.\u201d\n\nWalgreens lowered its forecast range for full-year adjusted earnings to $2.80 to $2.95 per share, after lowering the top end of its guidance the prior quarter. Adjusted earnings for the three months ending May 31 were 63 cents a share, worse than the 68 cents that Wall Street analysts anticipated.\n\nThe company said it expects recent headwinds to persist into the next fiscal year, according to presentation slides posted ahead of management\u2019s call with investors.\n\nThe Boots business saw quarterly sales of $5.7 billion, an increase of 2.8% from the year-ago period. The company had revived discussions last year about a potential exit from Boots but has since shelved plans for a possible initial public offering of Boots and is now exploring other options, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nOperating income in the quarter was $111 million compared to a $477 million operating loss a year ago when the company took a $431 million writedown on its Boots business.\n\nLike rival CVS Health Corp, Walgreens has been moving away from its retail roots and pushing deeper into more lucrative areas like primary care. The efforts have hit profits though, putting pressure on executives to execute a turnaround.\n\nThe shares lost half their value during the short tenure of Chief Executive Officer Roz Brewer. Under the current CEO Wentworth, who was appointed in 2023, the company has launched a review of the business aimed at increasing cash flow and growing more in health care. Late last year, the drugstore announced a $1 billion cost-cutting program, in part by closing unprofitable locations. On Thursday, management said they\u2019re on track to meet that goal.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe US health-care unit, which includes primary-care provider VillageMD, grew more than its traditional retail pharmacy division.\n\nThe health-care segment posted revenue of $2.1 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to the year-ago quarter. Walgreens has invested $5.2 billion in VillageMD, allowing it to open hundreds of doctors\u2019 offices in its drugstores. It has since announced plans to close 160 of the clinics, and last quarter announced a $5.8 billion writedown related to the business.\n\nThe company\u2019s US retail pharmacy unit posted revenue of $28.5 billion, an increase of 2.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\n--With assistance from Angel Adegbesan.\n\n(Updates with share move at market open.

        "title": "Walgreens woes continue with earnings miss, guidance cut and plans to shutter more stores",
        "content": "Walgreens shares tumbled early Thursday after the drugstore chain signaled that more store closings are on the way, missed earnings expectations for its third quarter and cut its annual forecast.\n\nThe company said it was finishing a multiyear plan to shutter some underperforming U.S. stores, but it didn\u2019t detail how many were targeted.\n\nWalgreens and major competitors like CVS and Rite Aid \u2014 which is going through a bankruptcy reorganization \u2014 have already closed hundreds of stores over the past few years. The companies have dealt with challenges that include years of tight reimbursement for their prescriptions and rising costs for running their locations.\n\nPlus, analysts say they\u2019ve also been hit by growing competition from Walmart, Amazon and other discount retailers over sales of goods sold outside their store pharmacies. Consumers also tend to grow more price conscious when inflation rises.\n\nWalgreens also has been closing VillageMD primary care clinics it had been installing next to its stores in order to grow its presence as a health care provider.\n\nChief Executive Tim Wentworth said in a statement that the company continues to face challenges that include \u201cpersistent pressure on the U.S. consumer.\u201d Wentworth, who joined the company last fall, has been conducting a review of its business.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc. runs about 12,500 drugstores worldwide, including more than 8,600 locations in the United States.\n\nThe company said it earned $344 million in its fiscal third quarter, with adjusted results totaling 63 cents per share. Revenue rose nearly 3% to $36.35 billion.\n\nAnalysts were looking for earnings of 68 cents per share on $35.9 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.\n\nWalgreens also said it now expects adjusted earnings to range from $2.80 to $2.95 for its fiscal year, which ends in August. That\u2019s down from a forecast of $3.20 to $3.35 per share that it had narrowed in March.\n\nAnalysts expect $3.20 per share.\n\nThat guidance cut was not \u201coverly shocking to us as the company now begins the next leg of its turnaround,\u201d Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny said in a research note.\n\nBut the overall results surprised investors. Shares of the Deerfield, Illinois, company sank nearly 16% to $13.20 in premarket trading.\n\nView comments",

Comparable sales increased 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nPharmacy sales increased 4.4% year over year, while comparable pharmacy sales increased 5.7%, benefiting from higher branded drug inflation and script growth.\n\nComparable prescriptions filled in the third quarter increased 1.6%, while comparable prescriptions excluding immunizations increased 1.7%.\n\nTotal prescriptions filled in the quarter, including immunizations, was 306.4 million, up 0.5%.\n\nRetail sales decreased by 4%, and comparable retail sales decreased by 2.3%, reflecting a challenging retail environment and continued channel shift. Increased promotional activity and higher shrink levels negatively affected retail margins.\n\nThe U.S. Healthcare\u00a0segment\u2019s third-quarter sales were\u00a0$2.1 billion, an increase of 7.6% year over year, led by\u00a0VillageMD\u00a0and Shields.\n\nThe International segment sales reached $5.7 billion, up 2.8% Y/Y, including a favorable currency impact of 1.1%.

Our results and outlook reflect these headwinds, despite solid performance in our International and\u00a0U.S. Healthcare\u00a0segments,\u201d commented Chief Executive Officer\u00a0Tim Wentworth.\n\nGuidance: Walgreens Boots Alliance has cut its fiscal year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance to $2.80-$2.95 versus\u00a0prior guidance of $3.20-$3.35 and consensus of $3.22.\n\nThe company says the guidance reflects challenging pharmacy industry trends and a worse-than-expected\u00a0U.S.\u00a0consumer environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next: Investor Optimism Dampens as Walgreens Boots Alliance Struggles With Market Turbulence.\n\nPrice Action: WBA shares are down 15.40% at $13.25 during the premarket session at the last check on Thursday.\n\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE (WBA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article US Retail Pharma Giant Walgreens Boots Alliance Q3 Earnings And Annual Outlook Disappoints, Stock Sinks originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.63 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.67 per share. This compares to earnings of $1 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -5.97%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this largest U.S. drugstore chain would post earnings of $0.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.20, delivering a surprise of 46.34%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nWalgreens , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, posted revenues of $36.35 billion for the quarter ended May 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.07%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $35.42 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nWalgreens shares have lost about 40% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 14.9%.\n\nWhat's Next for Walgreens?\n\nWhile Walgreens has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Walgreens: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.64 on $36.19 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.21 on $145.92 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores is currently in the bottom 8% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector, Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024.\n\nThis restaurant chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +34.4%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nTexas Roadhouse's revenues are expected to be $1.34 billion, up 14.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Nasdaq: WBA) today announced financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended May 31, 2024.\n\nChief Executive Officer Tim Wentworth said:\n\n\"We continue to face a difficult operating environment, including persistent pressures on the U.S. consumer and the impact of recent marketplace dynamics which have eroded pharmacy margins. Our results and outlook reflect these headwinds, despite solid performance in both our International and U.S. Healthcare segments.\n\nInformed by our strategic review, we are focused on improving our core business: retail pharmacy, which is central to the future of healthcare. We are addressing critical issues with urgency and working to unlock opportunities for growth. Many of these actions will take time, but I am confident that we have the right team and the right strategy to lead a business turnaround for the Walgreens that our customers and patients need.\"\n\nOverview of Third Quarter Results\n\nWBA third quarter sales increased 2.6 percent from the year-ago quarter to $36.4 billion, an increase of 2.5 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting sales growth across all segments.\n\nThird quarter operating income was $111 million compared to an operating loss of $477 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of $588 million, which reflects lapping a $431 million non-cash impairment of pharmacy license intangible assets in Boots UK in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating income** was $613 million, a decrease of 36.3 percent on a constant currency basis reflecting lower sale-leaseback gains and softer U.S. retail and pharmacy performance, partly offset by cost savings initiatives and improved profitability in the U.S. Healthcare segment.\n\nStory continues\n\nNet earnings in the third quarter were $344 million compared to net earnings of $118 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of $225 million reflecting higher operating income. Adjusted net earnings** were $545 million, down 36.5 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting lower adjusted operating income**.\n\nEPS in the third quarter was $0.40 compared to $0.14 in the year-ago quarter, reflecting an increase of $0.26. Adjusted EPS** was $0.63, reflecting a decrease of 36.6 percent, or $0.36 on both a reported and constant currency basis.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $605 million in the third quarter and free cash flow** was $334 million, a $778 million increase compared with the year-ago quarter, each driven primarily by phasing and optimization of working capital. The increase in free cash flow also benefited from decreased capital expenditures.\n\nOverview of Fiscal 2024 Year-to-Date Results\n\nSales in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 6.2 percent from the year-ago period to $110.1 billion, an increase of 5.6 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across all segments.\n\nOperating loss in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $13.1 billion compared to an operating loss of $6.4 billion in the year-ago period, an increase in operating loss of $6.7 billion. Operating loss in the current period reflects a $12.4 billion non-cash impairment charge related to VillageMD goodwill, which resulted in a $5.8 billion charge attributable to WBA, net of tax and non-controlling interest. Operating loss in the current period also reflects a $455 million non-cash impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. Prior year operating loss reflects a $6.8 billion pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation and a $431 million non-cash impairment of pharmacy license intangible assets in Boots UK. Adjusted operating income** was $2.2 billion, a decrease of 31.5 percent on a constant currency basis reflecting a challenging U.S. retail environment, reimbursement pressure and lower sale-leaseback gains, partly offset by cost savings and improved profitability in the U.S. Healthcare segment.\n\nNet loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $5.6 billion compared to a net loss of $2.9 billion in the year-ago period, an increase in net loss of $2.7 billion, reflecting the non-cash impairment charges and lapping a $1.5 billion gain on sales of Cencora and Option Care Health shares last year. Adjusted net earnings** decreased 24.9 percent, or $712 million to $2.2 billion, down 25.3 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting lower adjusted operating income** partly offset by a lower adjusted effective tax** rate due to the recognition of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions in the second quarter.\n\nLoss per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $6.53 compared to a loss per share of $3.36 in the year-ago period, an increase in loss per share of $3.17. Adjusted EPS** decreased 24.9 percent, or $0.83, to $2.49, reflecting a decrease of 25.3 percent on a constant currency basis.\n\nNet cash used for operating activities was $314 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and free cash flow** was negative $1.1 billion, a $1.2 billion decrease compared with the year-ago period, with each driven primarily by lower earnings, $780 million in higher payments related to legal matters and phasing of working capital. The decrease in free cash flow was partly offset by $497 million in decreased capital expenditures.\n\nBusiness Segments\n\nU.S. Retail Pharmacy\n\nThree months ended May 31, Nine months ended May 31, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Sales $ 28,503 $ 27,866 $ 86,308 $ 82,648 Adjusted operating income *** $ 501 $ 962 $ 1,947 $ 3,134\n\nThe U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment had third quarter sales of $28.5 billion, an increase of 2.3 percent from the year-ago quarter driven entirely by comparable pharmacy sales, partly offset by a retail decline. Comparable sales increased 3.5 percent from the year-ago quarter.\n\nPharmacy sales increased 4.4 percent and comparable pharmacy sales increased 5.7 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, benefiting from higher branded drug inflation and script growth. Comparable prescriptions filled in the third quarter, adjusted to 30-day equivalents increased 1.6 percent from the year-ago quarter while comparable prescriptions excluding immunizations increased 1.7 percent. Total prescriptions filled in the quarter, including immunizations, adjusted to 30-day equivalents was 306.4 million, an increase of 0.5 percent versus the prior year quarter. Pharmacy margin was negatively impacted by brand mix impacts and reimbursement pressure.\n\nRetail sales decreased 4.0 percent and comparable retail sales decreased 2.3 percent compared with the year-ago quarter, reflecting a challenging retail environment and continued channel shift. Retail margin was negatively affected by increased promotional activity and higher shrink levels.\n\nAdjusted operating income** decreased 47.9 percent to $501 million compared to $1.0 billion in the year-ago quarter, reflecting lower sale and leaseback gains, a challenging retail environment and reimbursement pressure, net of procurement savings, partly offset by cost savings initiatives.\n\nInternational\n\nThree months ended May 31, Nine months ended May 31, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Sales $ 5,727 $ 5,573 $ 17,581 $ 16,414 Adjusted operating income *** $ 175 $ 208 $ 562 $ 676\n\nThe International segment had third quarter sales of $5.7 billion, an increase of 2.8 percent from the year-ago quarter, including a favorable currency impact of 1.1 percent. Sales increased 1.6 percent on a constant currency basis, with the Germany wholesale business growing 4.9 percent and Boots UK sales growing 1.6 percent.\n\nBoots UK comparable pharmacy sales increased 5.8 percent on a constant currency basis compared with the year-ago quarter. Boots UK comparable retail sales increased 6.0 percent on a constant currency basis compared to the year-ago quarter with growth across all categories, and increased total retail market share. Boots.com continued to perform strongly with sales growing 13.8 percent representing 15.6 percent of Boots total retail sales.\n\nAdjusted operating income decreased 15.8 percent to $175 million, a decrease of 16.6 percent on a constant currency basis compared with the year-ago quarter, due to lapping real estate gains in the year-ago period.\n\nU.S. Healthcare\n\nThree months ended May 31, Nine months ended May 31, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Sales $ 2,125 $ 1,975 $ 6,232 $ 4,597 Operating loss $ (220 ) $ (522 ) $ (13,715 ) $ (1,431 ) Adjusted operating loss *** $ (22 ) $ (172 ) $ (151 ) $ (483 ) Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP measure) $ 23 $ (113 ) $ 1 $ (346 )\n\nThe U.S. Healthcare segment had third quarter sales of $2.1 billion, an increase of 7.6 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, led by VillageMD and Shields. VillageMD grew 7 percent, reflecting additional lives in risk and fee-for-service. Shields grew 24 percent, driven by growth within existing partnerships.\n\nOperating loss was $220 million compared to an operating loss of $522 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating loss**, which excludes certain costs related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and stock compensation expense, was $22 million compared to $172 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA** of $23 million improved by $136 million versus the prior year quarter and represents the second consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA** for the segment, driven by cost discipline and growth from VillageMD and Shields.\n\nConference Call\n\nWBA will hold a conference call to discuss the third quarter results beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time today, June 27, 2024. A live simulcast as well as related presentation materials will be available through WBA\u2019s investor relations website at: https://investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com.

AND SUBSIDIARIES SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nThe following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the SEC rules, presented in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures in the press release, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThese supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the Company\u2019s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in the Company\u2019s historical operating results. The Company also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a basis for certain compensation programs it sponsors. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release.\n\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company\u2019s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as unusual one-time charges, tax expenses, and material litigation expenses, and that would impact diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\n\nConstant currency\n\nThe Company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in \"constant currency,\" which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The Company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the U.S. reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and such presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nComparable sales\n\nThe nine months ended May 31, 2024 comparable sales and prescriptions filled figures for the Company exclude the benefit of this year's leap day.\n\nFor the Company's U.S. Retail Pharmacy and International segments, Comparable sales are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. Comparable sales in constant currency exclude wholesale sales in Germany and sales from dispositions in the current period. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry and our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers\u2019 methods.\n\nWith respect to the International segment, comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales and comparable retail sales, are presented on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the discussion above in \"Constant currency\" for further details on constant currency calculations.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nThe Company considers certain metrics, such as comparable sales (in constant currency), comparable pharmacy sales (in constant currency), comparable retail sales (in constant currency), comparable number of prescriptions, comparable prescriptions excluding immunizations, and comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions to be key performance indicators because the Company\u2019s management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein.

These charges do not relate to the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company\u2019s operating performance. These charges are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses and Impairment of goodwill within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. 2 Acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities recorded in Operating income (loss) within the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Earnings. Examples of such costs include deal costs, severance, stock-based compensation, employee transaction success bonuses, and other integration related exit and disposal charges. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. These costs are significantly impacted by the timing and complexity of the underlying merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities and do not reflect the Company\u2019s current operating performance. 3 Acquisition-related amortization includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inventory valuation adjustments and stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, developed technology and contract intangibles. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company\u2019s GAAP financial statements. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP measures. Amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired, or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These charges are primarily recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. The stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustment reflects the difference between the fair value based remeasurement of awards under purchase accounting and the grant date fair valuation. Post-acquisition compensation expense recognized in excess of the original grant date fair value of acquiree awards are excluded from the related non-GAAP measures as these arise from acquisition-related accounting requirements or agreements, and are not reflective of normal operating activities. 4 Certain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements relate to significant charges associated with certain legal proceedings, including legal defense costs. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company\u2019s operating performance. These charges are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. In fiscal 2023, the Company recorded charges related to the opioid litigation settlement frameworks and certain other legal matters. 5 Transformational Cost Management Program charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan. These charges are primarily recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. These costs do not reflect current operating performance and are impacted by the timing of restructuring activity. 6 Adjustments to equity earnings in Cencora consist of the Company\u2019s proportionate share of non-GAAP adjustments reported by Cencora consistent with the Company\u2019s non-GAAP measures. 7 The Company\u2019s U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (\"LIFO\") method. This adjustment represents the impact on cost of sales as if the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using first-in first-out (\"FIFO\") method. The LIFO provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Therefore, the Company cannot control the amounts recognized or timing of these items. 8 Includes fair value gains or losses on the VPF derivatives and certain derivative instruments used as economic hedges of the Company\u2019s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These charges are recorded within Other income, net. The Company does not believe this volatility related to the mark-to-market adjustments on the underlying derivative instruments reflects the Company\u2019s operational performance. 9 Gains on the sale of equity method investments are recorded in Other income, net within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because these do not relate to the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business. 10 Includes significant gains resulting from the change in classification of investments as well as the fair value adjustments recorded to Other income, net. During the three months ended May 31, 2023, the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $76 million related to the change in classification of its previously held equity method investment in Option Care Health to an investment in equity security held at fair value. 11 Includes losses related to the sale of businesses. These charges are recorded in Other income net, within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. 12 Includes interest expense on external debt to fund incremental contributions to the Boots Plan required to complete the Trustee's acquisition of a bulk annuity policy (the \"Buy-In\") from Legal & General. The payments and related incremental interest expense are not indicative of normal operating performance. 13 Adjustments to income tax provision (benefit) include adjustments to the GAAP basis tax benefit commensurate with non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items including U.S. and UK tax law changes and equity method non-cash tax. These charges are recorded in Income tax provision (benefit) within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. 14 Adjustments to post-tax (loss) earnings from other equity method investments consist of the proportionate share of certain equity method investees\u2019 non-cash items or unusual or infrequent items consistent with the Company\u2019s non-GAAP adjustments. These charges are recorded in Post-tax (loss) earnings from other equity method investments within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees. 15 Due to the anti-dilutive effect resulting from periods where the Company reports a net loss, the impact of potentially dilutive securities on the per share amounts has been omitted from the calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted net loss per common share. 16 Includes impact of potentially dilutive securities in the calculation of weighted-average common shares, diluted for adjusted diluted net earnings per common share calculation purposes.\n\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS BY SEGMENT AND ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS\n\n(in millions) Three months ended May 31, 2024 U.S. Retail Pharmacy1 International U.S. Healthcare Corporate and Other Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

This measure does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures as the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments for future business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Cash Flows. 2 During the three months ended May 31, 2023, the Company paid $101 million to settle liability classified share-based payment awards related to acquiring the remaining 45% equity interest in CareCentrix. In addition to the $101 million, during the nine months ended May 31, 2023, the Company paid $335 million to settle liability classified share-based payment awards related to acquiring the remaining 30% equity interest in Shields. The Company also paid one-time compensation costs related to VillageMD's acquisition of Summit. The payments are not indicative of normal operating performance. 3 During the three and nine months ended May 31, 2024, the Company made incremental pension contributions of $7M and $386M, respectively, to the Boots Plan as part of the Trustee's acquisition of a bulk annuity policy (the \"Buy-In\") from Legal and General.

        "content": "Down 35% on the year, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock is one of the few microchip and semiconductor plays that investors should avoid.\n\nINTC stock is currently the third worst performer in the benchmark S&P 500 index this year. Only Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) have performed worse.\n\nThis as most microchip stocks, particularly those associated with artificial intelligence, skyrocket. In the last 12 months, shares of rival chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) have doubled, while Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has tripled.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChange and INTC Stock\n\nIntel continues to struggle with a multi-year, multi-billion dollar strategy to change its business model.\n\nManagement, led by GEO Pat Gelsinger, want Intel to move from designing microchips and processors to manufacturing them for themselves and other companies.\n\nThe change, which would make Intel a microchip foundry and see it compete against other foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM), has zapped the company\u2019s resources and hurt its earnings.\n\nIn March of this year, Intel received $8.50 billion from the U.S. government through the \u201cChips and Science Act\u201d that aims to make America more self-sufficient at making semiconductors.\n\nThe company also expects to receive federal loans up to $11 billion and a tax credit benefit on up to 25% of more than $100 billion in qualified investments.\n\nGelsinger has said that Intel will use the government funds to build foundries in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon.\n\nBut even the billions funneled to the company from Washington, D.C. hasn\u2019t been enough to shift Intel\u2019s strategy out of neutral gear.\n\nIntel has halted construction on a $20 billion microchip manufacturing plant it was building in Ohio, saying that business conditions and demand need to improve before it can complete the facility.\n\nThis as other chipmakers such as Nvidia complain that they can\u2019t keep up with global demand for their products.\n\nNew AI Chips\n\nTo its credit, Intel has been trying to keep pace with rival chipmakers even as it struggles to shifts its business model.\n\nEarlier in June, Intel unveiled new AI microchips for data centers days after rivals Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) each announced their latest chips.\n\nIntel\u2019s new Xeon 6 processor will deliver better performance and power efficiency for high-intensity data center workloads, said Gelsinger at the Computex technology conference in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nSix months ago, Intel launched its Xeon line of processors for data centers, as well as its Gaudi 3 processor for training AI models and chatbots.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel is also touting the fact that prices for its Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 AI accelerator chips will be lower than rival chips. Even more recently, Intel revealed details for its upcoming Lunar Lake processors that are expected to ship in this year\u2019s third quarter and power AI personal computers.\n\nWhile Intel\u2019s chips are technically impressive, critics point out that they\u2019re shipping later than the chips of rivals Nvidia and AMD, and that Intel continues to play catch-up and lose valuable market share in the AI space.\n\nThis situation has weighed heavily on INTC stock, making it a long-term loser for shareholders. Over the past five years, Intel stock is down more than 30%. The shares are half the price they were at in 2021.\n\nSell Intel Stock\n\nInvestors considering buying Intel\u2019s stock need to ask themselves why? With most other microchip and semiconductor stocks rallying right now, why bet on INTC stock, which has been a long-term underperformer?\n\nWorse, it doesn\u2019t look like Intel\u2019s situation is going to improve anytime soon. With its costly turnaround strategy likely to take several more years to complete, shareholders of the company are likely to remain deep in the red for the foreseeable future.\n\nIt\u2019s not worth it. Intel stock is a sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "In its upcoming report, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) is predicted by Wall Street analysts to post quarterly earnings of $0.68 per share, reflecting a decline of 32% compared to the same period last year. Revenues are forecasted to be $35.96 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 1.6%.\n\nOver the past 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been adjusted downward by 0.3% to its current level. This demonstrates the covering analysts' collective reassessment of their initial projections during this period.\n\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights.\n\nThat said, let's delve into the average estimates of some Walgreens metrics that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenues- U.S. Retail Pharmacy' of $27.89 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +0.1%.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Revenues- International' to come in at $5.74 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +3% year over year.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Revenues- U.S. Healthcare' reaching $2.12 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +7.6%.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Revenues- U.S. Retail Pharmacy- Pharmacy' should come in at $20.63 billion. The estimate points to a change of -1.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenues- U.S. Retail Pharmacy- Retail' should arrive at $6.69 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -4% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Adjusted operating income (loss)- U.S. Retail Pharmacy' will reach $620.19 million. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $962 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Adjusted operating income (loss)- International' will reach $190.99 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $208 million.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Walgreens here>>>\r\n\r\nOver the past month, Walgreens shares have recorded returns of -0.4% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.7% change.

The broad market index declined by 0.16%, closing at 5,464.62, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.18% to 17,689.36. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 15.57 points, or 0.04%, to end at 39,150.33.\n\nNvidia shares fell 3.2%, following a drop of over 3% on Thursday after hitting an all-time high. Despite this, the chipmaker remains up 155% year-to-date and briefly surpassed Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the most valuable public company earlier in the week.\n\nThe S&P 500 reached an intraday record of 5,505.53 earlier this week and posted a 0.6% weekly gain. The Nasdaq ended the week flat, while the Dow saw a 1.45% increase, marking its best weekly performance since May.\n\nThis week, the markets will largely be focused on important economic developments, most notably the durable goods report on Thursday, followed by the core PCE and University of Michigan reports on Friday. In addition, several Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Governor Waller on Monday and New York Fed President Williams on Sunday.\n\nFor PCE data, economists at Goldman Sachs believe that personal income increased by 0.4% and personal spending grew by 0.26% in May.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that the core PCE price index rose +0.13%, corresponding to a year-over-year rate of 2.59%,\u201d Goldman economists said in a note. \u201c Additionally, we expect that the headline PCE price index increased by 0.03% from the prior month, corresponding to a year-over-year rate of 2.51%.\u201d\n\nInvestors await Micron\u2019s earnings\n\nThe Q2 earnings season is nearing its end, though several significant reports are still yet to be released to close out the period.\n\nInvestors\u2019 attention will particularly be focused on the upcoming Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) print, an AI memory chipmaker whose shares surged more than 60% this year amid the ongoing bull market. Micron will report the results on Wednesday following the market\u2019s close.\n\nTwo other major reports that will be in the spotlight will be those by FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nIn addition, companies like Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI), and McCormick&Company (NYSE:MKC) will also report this week.\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nRBC Capital Markets: \u201cWe\u2019ve added a new stress test to our valuation analysis. This is an optimistic scenario which bakes in lower inflation, lower 10-year yields, and more Fed cuts than the current consensus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese assumptions imply that a reasonable trailing P/E for the S&P 500 at year-end would be around 22.5x and that a fair value for the index would be 5,500. That 5,500 index level is close to recent highs. While we consider our valuation model to be a compass, not a GPS, our work here nevertheless continues to make us worry that the US equity market has gotten a little ahead of itself in the short term due to a little too much optimism around interest rates and inflation after the latest CPI print/Fed meeting.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nEvercore ISI: \u201cStocks are expensive and will remain so as S&P 500 is forecast to end the year at 6,000. But as the history of past \u201cexpensive markets\u201d illustrates, some of the strongest gains can occur once stocks become expensive.\n\n\u201cWhat makes each of the prior \u201cexpensive markets\u201d unique is their own trajectory with regard to time, price, earnings and breadth. Common to all, valuation alone is not sufficient to sell. 2024\u2019s \u201cexpensive\u201d market is driven by the promise of the AI Revolution, a Fed willing to cut interest rates for the \u201cright\u201d reasons, a period still relatively small in terms of duration and gains, the prospect of a return to earnings growth in 2024, and relatively robust breadth despite Mag 7 doing much of the lifting.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley: \u201cWith macro data broadly coming in softer YTD, many lower quality and economically sensitive areas of the market have lagged, while a narrow list of higher quality mega caps have carried performance. In our view, this is a sign the market is becoming more focused on growth softening and less focused on inflation and rates. The underperformance of small caps despite falling rates is a good example of this phenomenon. This backdrop syncs with our long-standing view that the current policy mix of heavy fiscal and higher front end rates is effectively crowding out many economic participants.\u201d\n\nBTIG: \u201cLast week saw some of the biggest inflows on record into large-cap tech/growth funds. That feels like a sign of froth after the run we have had. We remain concerned about a near-term unwind of many YTD leaders. With that said, even within the 'Mag 7' we are seeing dispersion and charts like AMZN and GOOGL are still constructive and not overly stretched. If the SPX is going to avoid a bigger pullback into July, bulls need to see continued rotation below the surface.\u201d\n\nUBS: \u201cAs we have said over the past several months, we believe the market backdrop remains favorable due to: 1) solid and broadening profit growth, 2) disinflation, 3) a Fed pivoting to rate cuts, and 4) surging investment in AI infrastructure and applications. These trends have propelled the S&P 500 to a string of all-time highs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a result of the healthy economic growth and surging investment in AI, we look for S&P 500 EPS to rise 11% in 2024 (to USD 250) and 6% in 2025 (to USD 265), which could prove to be conservative. Overall, we believe the environment remains supportive for US equities and investors should have a full allocation to the asset class. Our S&P 500 targets are 5,500 for year-end and 5,600 for June 2025.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles\n\nChina wants EU to scrap EV tariff plans as talks start\n\nExplainer-What next for Telecom Italia after network sale to KKR?\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple's EU issues, Broadcom's chips, talks over EV tariffs - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Wall Street looks set to start the new week on a positive note, although the Fed's inflation gauge, due at the end of the week, could determine near-term direction. Apple has run foul of European Union rules, while Broadcom is working with Chinese firm ByteDance over the supply of AI chips.\n\n1. Futures just higher ahead of key inflation release\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Monday, starting the last week of the first half of the year near record highs, largely boosted by the enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence.\n\nBy 04:20 ET (08:20 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 70 points, or 0.2%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 12 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 45 points, or 0.2%.\n\nThe S&P 500, a broad-based benchmark index, hit a new intraday record late last week, and is up almost 15% so far this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has gained almost 18%.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average has lagged, by contrast, gaining just under 4% in the first half of the year.\n\nThe main focus this week will be Friday\u2019s release of the May personal consumption expenditure data, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge.\n\nInvestors have been trying to gauge when the U.S. central bank will start cutting interest rates, with Fed officials expressing their desire for more inflation data confirming the easing of prices before agreeing to a reduction.\n\nThere are also a number of key companies earnings this week, including FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and Nike (NYSE:NKE).\n\n2. Apple has breached EU rules - EC\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has run into regulatory difficulties in the European Union.\n\nThe European Commission, which also acts as the EU antitrust and technology regulator, said Monday the iPhone maker's App Store rules breach EU tech rules because they prevent app developers from steering consumers to alternative offers.\n\nThe EU executive said it was also opening an investigation into Apple over its new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app stores.\n\n\"None of these business terms allow developers to freely steer their customers. For example, developers cannot provide pricing information within the app or communicate in any other way with their customers to promote offers available on alternative distribution channels,\" the EU watchdog said.\n\nThe EU opened an investigation into the U.S. tech giants in March under a landmark new law known as the Digital Markets Act.\n\nSo-called anti-steering rules were one of the big areas of focus of the probe. Under the DMA, tech firms are not allowed to block businesses from telling their users about cheaper options for their products or about subscriptions outside of an app store.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. ByteDance working with chipmaker Broadcom - Reuters\n\nChinese technology firm ByteDance is working with U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to develop an advanced artificial intelligence processor, even as the U.S. is attempting to restrict the export of these vital chips to its main economic rival.\n\nA deepening of the partnership between the two companies, which Reuters reported on Monday, represents more efforts by Chinese technology firms to secure the supply of advanced AI chips, after the U.S. blocked several major chipmakers, most notably NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), from selling their most advanced AI technology to China.\n\nThe 5 nanometre chip will be compliant with U.S. export curbs and is likely to be outsourced for manufacturing to TSMC, the world\u2019s biggest contract chipmaker.\n\nBytedance and Broadcom already have partnerships in place, with the TikTok owner having purchased several AI-linked chips from the firm over the past couple of years.\n\nThis follows a broad push into generative AI over the past year, which has served as a major source of demand for global chipmaking firms.\n\n4. EU to hold EV trade talks with China\n\nChina and the European Union have agreed to start talks on the planned imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) being imported into the European market.\n\nThe European Commission announced earlier this month that it is planning to impose provisional duties on EVs produced in China of up to 38.1%, on top of its standard 10% tariff for car imports.\n\nThe duties are due to apply by July 4.\n\nThe news prompted the ire of Beijing, with Chinese authorities hinting at the possibility of retaliatory measures.\n\nThe state-aligned Global Times newspaper reported on Sunday that China wants the European Union to revoke its decision to impose provisional tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.\n\nWhile the talks hint at the possibility of a de-escalation of this trade conflict, the United States also hike tariffs on Chinese cars in May, suggesting coordination in the West's trade war with Beijing.\n\n5. Yen intervention talk on the rise\n\nIntervention talk is on the rise in foreign exchange markets Monday, after the Japanese yen weakened to its lowest level against the dollar since April 29 earlier Monday, with the USD/JPY pair climbing to a high of 159.93.\n\nIn April the pair touched a 34-year low of 160.245, leading to Japanese authorities spending roughly 9.8 trillion yen to support the currency.\n\nThe yen has come under renewed pressure after the Bank of Japan's decision this month to hold off on reducing bond-buying stimulus until its July meeting.\n\nThe yen losses prompted Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda to say on Monday that authorities will take appropriate steps if there is excessive foreign exchange movement.\n\n\"We will firmly respond to moves that are too rapid or driven by speculators,\" Kanda said, while noting that the authorities have no specific levels in mind on when to intervene.\n\nKanda said that the addition of Japan to the U.S. Treasury's foreign exchange manipulation monitoring list had \"absolutely no impact\" on Tokyo's policy options.\n\nA U.S. Treasury report issued last week added Japan to its foreign exchange monitoring list alongside six countries that were on the previous list.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple's EU issues, Broadcom's chips, talks over EV tariffs - what's moving markets\n\nEU has solution to use frozen Russian funds for Ukraine, Borrell says\n\nSome Indian rate panelists see growth risks from tight policy\n\nView comments",

The company's earnings report is expected on June 27, 2024. In that report, analysts expect Walgreens Boots Alliance to post earnings of $0.68 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 32%.

        "content": "Nike will announce its quarterly results on Thursday. (Rick Bowmer, Associated Press)\n\nEarnings season is all but over, but trading updates from key companies across the globe are providing insights into how certain markets are performing.\n\nInvestors next week will see updates from UK consumer-facing companies AO World and Currys, which will allow them to gauge how households have been coping with cost of living pressures.\n\nIn Europe, fashion retailer H&M is expected to come in above expectations, with analysts upgrading the stock ahead of the results.\n\nAcross the pond, Nike will try to convince investors it is on the right track, as analysts appear split on the direction of the athletic apparel\u2019s stock in 2025.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHere's what to look out for:\n\nAO World (AO.L) \u2013 Reports full-year results on Wednesday 26 June\n\nWhite goods specialist AO World is expected to report around \u00a310.4bn in revenues for the full year when it announces results next Wednesday.\n\nAO World has secured a 16% share in the major domestic appliance market, commanding nearly a third of the online segment.\n\nIn its last trading statement in March, CEO and founder John Roberts expressed cautious optimism. Despite anticipating a 9% drop in annual sales to around \u00a31bn, marking the third consecutive annual decline, Roberts highlighted that pre-tax profit is expected to reach the upper end of the \u00a328m to \u00a333m range, an increase from \u00a38m the previous year.\n\n\u201cAnalysts will look to any guidance for the new fiscal year to March 2025, when they think sales will jump by 9% to \u00a31.1bn and profits will advance again to \u00a339m,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nRead more: What is a stock split and why are big tech companies opting for it?\n\nThey added that AO World, which has not paid a dividend since its flotation in 2014, maintains a \u201chealthy enough\u201d balance sheet, bolstered by a \u00a340m placing in 2022.

However, Williams Trading analyst Sam Poser cut his price target on Nike to $75 as he does not believe Nike will be able \u201cto get itself out of its current doldrums as it has when it faced challenges in the past.\u201d\n\nPoser said the stock is \u201ctoo expensive\u201d and he does not expect the company to do anything to \u201cdeserve its current multiple.\u201d\n\nRead more: Analysts see Nike stock dropping 20%\n\nBofA analysts said they see some green shoots in what Nike is doing but warn that Nike faces a mix of headwinds in the first half of 2025.\n\n\u201cWe see sufficient margin levers in the near-term to support earnings and are beginning to hear about green shoots around innovation and the new product pipeline,\u201d the bank\u2019s analysts wrote.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect these green shoots to translate into sales growth in the first half of fiscal 2025, but building evidence of Nike\u2019s innovation pipeline would bolster confidence in a 2H25 turnaround.\u201d UBS analysts are more optimistic about H&M's profitability. (ymgerman via Getty Images)\n\nH&M (HM-B.ST) \u2014 Reports quarterly results on Thursday 27 June\n\nEuropean fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz AB has seen its stock upgraded by UBS from Neutral to Buy ahead of its quarterly results.\n\nH&M\u2019s stock was upgraded as UBS analysts are more optimistic on the company\u2019s profitability as it begins to show signs of a sales recovery.\n\nUBS also increased the price target for H&M's stock to SEK212.00 (\u00a315.95) from the previous SEK148.00 (\u00a311.13).\n\nRead more: UK interest rates held at 16-year high ahead of election\n\nDeutsche Bank said the Swedish fashion retailer is \u201cset to report another strong set of numbers\u201d for the quarter$ftsss and expects margin recovery to be in the focus. The German bank has lifted its share price target from SEK155 to SEK165 but has maintained its sell rating for the stock.\n\nThe company's earnings are expected to grow by 16.9% annually, outpacing the Swedish market forecast of 14.1%.\n\nCurrys (CURY.L) - Reports full-year results on Thursday 27 June\n\nElectrical retailer Currys\u2019 results will tell investors a lot about how consumers are doing under the cost of living squeeze.\n\nAt its first-half results in December, Currys\u2019 balance sheet appeared less robust than AO World's. Despite net debt being only \u00a3101m, the FTSE 250 (^FTMC) company had a \u00a3190m pension liability and leases totalling \u00a31.1bn.\n\nThis financial backdrop made the February bid from activist investor Elliott surprising. Elliott initially offered 62p per share, later increasing it to 67p, representing a 42% premium. However, management and investors held firm, and Elliott withdrew its bid in March.\n\nCurrys\u2019 shares have remained above the offer price, bolstered by improved trading and the disposal of its Greek business. CEO Alex Baldock raised earnings expectations twice, with the year-end trading update in May marking a positive outlook.\n\nRead more: What are share repurchases?\n\nFor the full year, Baldock reported a 2% like-for-like drop in group-wide sales, with the UK down 2% and the Nordic region down 3%. However, both areas showed improved momentum in the second half. He indicated that adjusted pre-tax profit, excluding Greece, would range between \u00a3115m and \u00a3120m, surpassing the prior expectation of \u00a3105m and close to last year\u2019s \u00a3119m outcome.\n\n\u201cThe fact that broadly flat profits should be seen as good news is a sign of how tough trading has been for Currys, where the Nordic business in particular has been under pressure and the cost-of-living crisis has put the squeeze on UK consumers,\u201d AJ Bell wrote.\n\n\u201cAgain, improving consumer confidence thanks to cooling inflation, solid wage growth, lower energy bills and low unemployment could help Currys if those trends are maintained, even though its target market remains fiercely competitive.\u201d\n\nIf Baldock provides guidance for the new fiscal year, consensus estimates project:\n\nGroup sales of \u00a38.5n, slightly down from \u00a38.6bn due to the Greek business disposal Pre-tax profit of \u00a3136m, up from \u00a3117m Resumption of dividend payments at 1.3p per share\n\nOther companies reporting this week include:\n\nMonday 24 June\n\nL\u2019Occitane (COC.F)\n\nProsus (PRX.AS)\n\nTrigano (TRIP.XC)\n\nTuesday 25 June\n\nFedEx (FDX)\n\nCarnival (CCL)\n\nWednesday 26 June\n\nVolex (VLXGF)\n\nMicron (MU)\n\nGeneral Mills (GIS)\n\nLevi Strauss (LEVI)\n\nBlackBerry (BB)\n\nNovaGold (NG)\n\nThursday 27 June\n\nMoonpig (MOON.L)\n\nNext Fifteen (GB0030026057.SG)\n\nMcCormick (MKC)\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)\n\nFriday 28 June\n\nNo major companies reporting\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nWatch: AI investments will go from 'hot names' to essentials</p>\\n<p>Jablonski observes that investors currently associate the \\\"Magnificent 7\\\" tech giants with AI.

        "title": "Earnings Preview: Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline",
        "content": "The market expects Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended May 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on June 27, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis largest U.S. drugstore chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.68 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -32%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $35.96 billion, up 1.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.54% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Walgreens?\n\nFor Walgreens, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.70%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Walgreens will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Walgreens would post earnings of $0.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.20, delivering a surprise of +46.34%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWalgreens doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investors must be cautious about the kinds of stocks with the most growth potential and good fundamentals to maximize returns while minimizing risks. Key fundamentals should lie at the helm of the strategy. Additionally, understanding the industry landscape, competitive advantages, and potential risks is essential. A good understanding forms the core of picking stocks in 2024 for long-term gains. That is about more than just the financial data; it requires a comprehensive approach toward investing in equities.\n\nSuch an approach will help investors make very informed decisions that best conform to the goals of investment and risk tolerance. Each company in the list is focused and seriously working on its diversification streams of revenues while improving financial performance through several innovative efforts in respective industries. Finally, the focus on cost-cutting measures driving long-term growth and margin expansion clearly defines these as must-buy stocks with a fair risk/reward balance.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) A close-up of the blue and yellow Warner Bros (WBD) sign.\n\nSource: Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) leads in media and entertainment. The company has an extensive content portfolio across television, film, and digital platforms. Ad revenues signify sequential improvement, with a 70% increase in direct-to-consumer (D2C) advertising.\u00a0This\u00a0offsets a 7% drop in overall ad sales (Q1 2024). Strong revenue growth in important European countries like Germany, Italy, and Poland highlights the durability of legacy broadcast assets. Moreover, overall income volatility is reduced by offsetting decreases in traditional linear TV with notable increases in D2C advertising revenue.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurther, projects like the\u00a0Ad-Lite service in Latin America and the next Disney and Hulu package demonstrate creative ways to increase income via collaborations. Seasonality notwithstanding, free cash flow increased by $1.3 billion in Q1 compared to Q1 2023, reaching over $400 million. The trailing 12-month free cash flow was $7.5 billion, which shows strong cash creation potential. Initiatives to reduce debt, such as a $1.1 billion payback in Q1, highlight the need for leverage management and financial restraint.\n\nOverall, Warner Bros. Discovery stands out as one of the top must-buy stocks due to its strategic shift towards D2C offerings and innovative advertising solutions.\n\nCVS Health (CVS) The front sign for a CVS Pharmacy, CVS stock\n\nSource: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.com\n\nCVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is a diversified healthcare services company that combines pharmacy services, health benefits, and retail operations. In Q1 2024, CVS Health had an adjusted operating income of almost $3 billion. Despite difficulties, CVS Health generated adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) for the quarter of $1.31, demonstrating its operational resilience in handling demands from the Medicare Advantage business and other areas. Despite weaker results than Q1 2023, the firm generated high cash flow from operations.\u00a0This\u00a0amounted to $4.9 billion in Q1, highlighting sharp financial liquidity and operational efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, advancement and adaptability to market demands are reflected in CVS Health\u2019s biosimilar endeavors through its Cordavis company and the introduction of transparent pharmacy models like\u00a0CVS CostVantage. These programs improve client growth and retention and generate cost savings. Initiatives to increase margins, strategically reprice, and alter benefits for 2025 show a proactive strategy to boost profitability and position in the healthcare benefits market.\n\nTo sum up, CVS Health\u2019s inclusion in the must-buy stocks list\u00a0is justified\u00a0by its strong financial performance, robust cash flow generation, strategic initiatives in biosimilars, and transparent pharmacy models.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) leads in retail pharmacy and healthcare services, offering products and services through its pharmacy chains. Due to reduced adjusted effective tax rates and higher profitability in the US Healthcare division, adjusted EPS climbed by 3.4% to $1.20, or 2.8%, on a constant currency basis. Further, for fiscal 2024, Walgreens Boots Alliance is expected to save $1 billion in costs,\u00a0primarily\u00a0via organizational reforms, site optimization, and enhancements to the operating models of pharmacies and retail stores.\n\nMoreover, even with the non-cash impairment costs associated with VillageMD and long-lived assets, Walgreens Boots Alliance has shown\u00a0continued cost-cutting initiatives and increased profitability in areas like US healthcare. In addition to bolstering present profitability, the emphasis is on cost control and operational effectiveness, creating the groundwork for long-term development and margin expansion. These initiatives may boost working capital by $500 million. They will decrease CapEx by $600 million in fiscal 2024 and boost free cash flow.\n\nTo conclude, Walgreens Boots Alliance earns its place in the must-buy stocks list by focusing on cost efficiency, strategic cost-cutting initiatives, and optimizing its retail and pharmacy operating models.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in WBD, CVS and WBA.

The transaction valued the combined companies at $21 billion. Shareholders received 0.674 Healthpeak shares per Physicians Realty Trust share.\n\nPhysicians brought to the table an internal property management platform and established industry relationships.

Its top three markets are San Francisco, Boston and Dallas, with 13.7 million square feet.\n\nIts balance sheet is top-notch, with just $1.7 billion of its long-term debt maturing before 2028. The weighted average interest rate of its $8.73 billion in total debt (not including lease liabilities) is a reasonable 3.8%.\n\nOn the same day it closed its merger, the company obtained a new $750 million, 5-year unsecured term loan with a fixed interest rate of 4.5% for the entire period.

While analysts don\u2019t love it, it trades at a low 8.4x its 2025 earnings per share estimate of $4.71.\n\nVerizon\u2019s quarterly dividend amounts to an annual payment of $2.66 a share, a yield of 6.8%. Income investors ought to like that.\n\nOne quarter into 2024, Verizon\u2019s wireless revenues were up 3.3%, to $19.5 billion, while its free cash flow in the first quarter was $2.7 billion, 17% higher than a year earlier. Its trailing 12-month free cash flow is $13.44 billion.\n\nOn a price-to-sales basis, its market cap is 1.24x sales, lower than its five-year average of 1.48x. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is 8.62x, less than its five-year average of 9.58x.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not nearly as cheap as it was last October, the high yield more than makes up for it.\n\nArtisan Partners Asset Management (APAM) Artisan Partners (APAM) logo\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nI\u2019ve recommended Wisconsin-based Artisan Partners Asset Management (NYSE:APAM) in the past.\n\nIn January 2022, I included it on my dividend-income ladder from 1% to 10% yields. It was 10.3% back then. A part of that yield was because of the 31-cent special dividend it paid out in 2021.\n\nYear-to-date, it\u2019s paid out $1.63 in dividends \u2014 February payment of 68 cents, February special dividend of 34 cents and May dividend of 61 cents \u2014 with approximately $1.26 to be paid out over the final two regular payments of the year. Based on $2.44 in annual dividends and a share price of $40, it\u2019s currently yielding 6.33%.\n\nOne of the things I like about Artisan is that nearly 13% of its voting shares are controlled by directors and executive management. They are, as they say, \u201cEating their own cooking.\u201d\n\nAs of May 31, it had assets under management (AUM) of $158.6 billion, with its funds business accounting for 49% and separate accounts for 51%. Its Q1 2024 adjusted operating income was $81.6 million, 16.6% higher than a year earlier, on $264.4 million in revenue, 12.8% higher year over year.\n\nWhenever it trades around $30, load up the truck and grab yourself an enhanced dividend yield.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Should You Buy the 3 Highest-Paying Dividend Stocks in the S&amp;P 500?",
        "content": "You don't have to be a dividend investor to love dividend stocks.\n\nEven if you prefer to invest in growth stocks, every investor loves to get a quarterly check in the mail or in their brokerage account.\n\nSo what are the best-paying dividend stocks today? One way to narrow down the list is to take a respected index like the S&P 500 and see what the top-yielding stocks are. Without further ado, let's see if any of the three top-yielding dividend stocks are worth buying. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Altria (dividend yield 8.8%)\n\nAltria(NYSE: MO) is the top dividend payer on the S&P 500. That shouldn't come as a surprise to investors who follow the stock. Tobacco stocks are well known as rewarding dividend stocks, and Altria and its peers were among the top performers on the stock market in the 20th century.\n\nThese days, the domestic Marlboro maker has seen its growth rate slow, but it's still highly profitable, and its low valuation allows it to pay a dividend yield of 8.8%.\n\nHowever, a high yield alone isn't a reason to buy a stock. Cigarettes are a declining industry, and Altria has struggled to move beyond them, despite numerous efforts to do so. The company spent $12 billion to take a 35% stake in JUUL and was left with practically nothing after several years of regulatory crackdowns. Its investment in cannabis grower Cronos Group also failed to create value, and it was also unable to find success with iQOS, Philip Morris International's heat-not-burn product.\n\nAltria has since turned to NJOY to drive its next-gen business, but that brand is still small, and its overall revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) both fell by 2.5% in the first quarter.\n\nDividend investors might be enticed by Altria's yield, but even for yield seekers, there are better options on the market. For example, you might want to consider British American Tobacco, which offers a dividend yield of 9.7%.\n\n2. Verizon (6.7% dividend yield)\n\nLike tobacco, telecom stocks are also well known for being strong dividend payers, and Verizon(NYSE: VZ) is a perennial high-yield dividend stock.\n\nAlso like tobacco, telecom is a slow-growth industry that tends to throw off rivers of cash. However, telecom is still a form of technology, and operators like Verizon have to make heavy capital expenditures to keep up with new technologies and infrastructure needs.\n\nThe good news is that Verizon and its peers seem to have passed the peak of the 5G investment cycle, meaning capital expenditures are expected to decline this year, lifting free cash flow.\n\nVerizon is still growing slowly with revenue up just 0.2% in the first quarter and wireless service revenue up 3.3% in the quarter, but competition in the industry seems to be normalizing, which should benefit Verizon.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor investors looking for a high yield from a reliably profitable company, Verizon is a smart buy.\n\n3. Walgreens Boots Alliance (6.4% dividend yield)\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) has been at or near the top of many of these lists recently, but mostly for the wrong reasons. Shares of the drugstore chain have plunged due to a combination of a loss of business related to COVID-19, legal settlements related to opioids, and questionable acquisitions to diversify away from its core business.\n\nThe business is weak enough that it cut its dividend by 48% in January in order to conserve cash to fund its growth and strengthen its balance sheet.\n\nNonetheless, Walgreens still offers a 6.4% dividend yield, which is primarily a result of the stock falling 54% during the past year and more than 70% during the past five years.\n\nIts second-quarter earnings report included a $5.8 billion goodwill impairment related to its acquisition, showing it's still reeling from bad acquisitions.\n\nHowever, revenue and adjusted earnings are growing modestly, and the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 5 based on its adjusted earnings per share forecast of $3.20 to $3.35.\n\nRisk-tolerant investors may be willing to take a chance on Walgreens, but I'd prefer to see clearer that the business is stabilizing and the worst is behind it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Verizon Communications wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "7 Dividend Stocks to Sell in June Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "There are many dividend stocks that make for great long-term investments, but conversely, there are many dividend stocks to sell before they wreak havoc on your portfolio.\n\nThe prospect of steady, cash-based returns is one of the main areas of appeal with dividend stocks, particularly high-yield dividend stocks. However, these payouts can be outweighed by the poor performance of the underlying stock.\n\nPoor fiscal performance and/or insurmountable headwinds can lead to price declines for shares, which even when coupled with the payouts, can result in lackluster or worse, negative, returns. Not only that, keep in mind that dividend payouts are not set in stone.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThey can be subject to change. Low-quality high-yield dividend stocks are typically at greater risk of dividend reductions or suspensions. The announcement of a dividend cut or suspension can lead to tremendous price declines. With these risks in mind, it\u2019s clear why you should exit any positions in the following seven dividend stocks to sell.\n\nB&G Foods (BGS)\n\nSource: Growers Express\n\nB&G Foods (NYSE:BGS) makes and sells a variety of branded baking and food products. Famous brands in its portfolio include Cream of Wheat, Crisco, Green Giant and Ortega. Among investors, BGS may be best known for its high dividend.\n\nAt current prices, BGS stock has a forward dividend yield of 9.05%. However, B&G Foods has a history of dividend cuts. In late 2022, the company slashed its quarterly payout by 60.4%, from 48 cents to 19 cents per share. If that\u2019s not bad enough, this stock has also experienced a sharp price decline, even after the announcement of this dividend reduction. During this time frame, BGS has fallen by around 40%, from $14 to around $8.40 per share.\n\nHigh debt and inflationary pressures keep weighing on B&G\u2019s fiscal performance. With a payout ratio of around 84.5%, even the current dividend rate may not be sustainable. Although plans to sell its frozen vegetable business could help reduce debt and provide capital for new acquisitions, helping to secure the dividend, err on the side of caution. Sell BGS, before another dividend cut or dismal quarterly earnings release sinks it further.\n\nCato (CATO) Cato storefront and logo\n\nSource: Nolichuckyjake / Shutterstock.com\n\nRight off the bat, you can tell that plenty of investors have already declared that Cato (NYSE:CATO) is one of the dividend stocks to sell. Shares in the specialty apparel retailer currently sports a forward dividend yield of 12.45%. Make no mistake, this isn\u2019t a bargain opportunity among dividend stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nRather, it\u2019s a sign that a dividend cut for CATO stock is likely forthcoming. As Seeking Alpha commentator Caffital Research argued earlier this month, the company is currently funding its dividend from cash on its balance sheet, not from cash flow. While Cato did report positive earnings last quarter, if results fail to improve further, and its cash position runs low, Cato will likely cut or suspend this rich payout.\n\nAlthough CATO trades at a 46.5% discount to its tangible book value, don\u2019t view this as a margin of safety. In the event that the company decides to cut or suspend its high payout, investors could exit positions in droves, leading to a tremendous price decline. Put simply, steer clear of this value trap. Sell existing positions, and make sure not to enter a new one.\n\nNextEra Energy Partners (NEP) Environmental conservation technology and approaching global sustainable ESG by clean energy and power from renewable natural resources. AI and green energy.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNextEra Energy Partners (NYSE:NEP) is a master limited partnership (MLP) that owns renewable electricity generation assets. Given recent clean energy and energy usage trends, one may think that NEP is a high-yield stock with growth potential.\n\nUnfortunately, much suggests this is not the case. Although true that NEP stock currently makes large distributions to its unitholders, NextEra doesn\u2019t necessarily have strong growth prospects. As I recently argued, when discussing utility stocks to sell, I pointed out how analysts and investors have become increasingly concerned about whether NEP stands to benefit from the current industry tailwinds.\n\nEven worse, there are growing concerns about the sustainability of NEP\u2019s 12.77% distribution yield as well. Like with the other dividend stocks to avoid discussed above and below, as investors are largely in this stock for the yield. Any reduction of this yield will undoubtedly lead to big losses. Whether you\u2019ve held NEP for some time, or bought in after its massive plunge last October, ahead of the next big potential plunge, head for the exits.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) shares have cratered in price since the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021. A variety of factors, including a worsening of its fiscal performance, a dividend cut, and its removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average have knocked this pharmacy stock down to multi-decade lows. Nevertheless, I wouldn\u2019t jump to the conclusion that things can only get better from here.\n\nAlthough a Walgreens turnaround is in motion, it may take years for the company to regain its financial health. Moreover, it\u2019s not a lock that WBA stock will hold steady, allowing contrarian investors to collect its 6.43% dividend while they wait for the comeback. While reduced, WBA\u2019s dividend still represents around 47.9% of the company\u2019s annual earnings. This may be cutting it thin, given Walgreens\u2019 need to reduce debt and finance its restructuring.\n\nRight now, there\u2019s renewed expectation that Walgreen is going to sell its U.K.-based Boots division, enabling it to bolster dividend sustainability. However, if this latest effort to sell Boots fails like the first attempt in 2022, concerns about a dividend cut could return. At risk of another sell-off, WBA remains one of the dividend stocks to sell.\n\nWendy\u2019s (WEN) A photo of a Wendy's chicken sandwich and chicken nuggets.\n\nSource: Deutschlandreform / Shutterstock.com\n\nWendy\u2019s (NASDAQ:WEN) doesn\u2019t have the \u201cdividend aristocrat\u201d respectability of its larger rival McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD), but it does beat out shares in the \u201cGolden Arches\u201d when it comes to yield.\n\nWEN stock is a high-yielder, with a forward dividend yield of 6%. MCD stock has a forward dividend yield of only 2.63%. However, even as MCD has been struggling lately, calling into question any argument that poor price performance makes it a better burger stock to buy, it\u2019s not as if WEN has been a stellar performer during this same time frame. Just like with Mickey D\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s is also facing growth challenges, as rising prices have turned customers away from fast food.\n\nWith a \u201cfast food fight\u201d on price emerging, investors are now concerned that even as sales stabilize, lower margins and profitability are now on the menu. As WEN\u2019s payout ratio now stands at a staggering 101%, barring a rapid rebound in profitability, a dividend cut may be imminent. Even if the payout rate stays as-is, stagnation could still lead to more share price declines. While cheaper than MCD, at 16.7 times forward earnings, other struggling restaurant stocks trade at far lower valuations.\n\nWhirlpool (WHR) The Whirlpool (WHR) logo on a corporate building. Whirlpool layoffs.\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhirlpool (NYSE:WHR) is another situation among high-yield dividend stocks where it\u2019s still questionable whether the dust has truly settled. Yes, after several years of declining revenue and profitability, sell-side forecasts call for the appliance maker\u2019s earnings to start bouncing back after this year.\n\nHowever, this bull case may hinge too highly on a sudden rebound in the U.S. residential real estate market. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Larry Ramer recently discussed, Wall Street remains very bearish on WHR stock, due to the continued challenges in the housing market. The Federal Reserve\u2019s continued \u201chigher for longer\u201d stance on interest rates calls into question whether improved demand for housing, and hence, household capital goods like appliances, is just around the corner.\n\nIf Whirlpool\u2019s profitability challenges continue, watch out. Even if Whirlpool\u2019s 7.71% dividend is sustainable, further earnings weakness could lead to further price declines that outweigh this rich payout. There has been speculation lately about Whirlpool being a takeover target, but until this starts to move beyond the rumor stage, consider it best to keep playing it safe. Stick to stronger dividend value plays, and steer clear of WHR.\n\nXerox Holdings (XRX) A photo of the Xerox logo on a storefront.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss/ShutterStock.com\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve called Xerox Holdings (NASDAQ:XRX) one of the dividend stocks to sell. Last November, I cited the prospect of continued price declines, and the questionability of its turnaround plans, as factors that made it a \u201cdoomed dividend stock.\u201d\n\nFlash forward to now. XRX stock has surged and sank, yet remains near where it was when I last laid out the bear case. Still, shares still give off serious \u201cdividend trap\u201d vibes. While another serious price decline still hasn\u2019t taken shape, don\u2019t rule it out. XRX\u2019s payout ratio currently stands at nearly 72%. To a greater extent than before, Xerox may not be able to sustain its 25 cent per share quarterly dividend.\n\nAgain, like with other \u201cdividend traps,\u201d chances are the announcement of a dividend cut would likely lead to a severe reversal in price for XRX. Even before the company possibly decides to trim its dividend, concerns about a cut could re-emerge. Per InvestorPlace Earnings, XRX missed on earnings last quarter. If that happens again, when Xerox releases Q2 results next month, this may elicit a strongly negative response from the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 At Risk Dividend Stocks Investors Should Sell Before It\u2019s Too Late",
        "content": "Navigating the world of high yield dividend stocks can be difficult. While those high yields reduce overall investor risk when share prices go down, they also require significant capital for their continued payment. Generally speaking, the higher a dividend yield, the greater the overall risk. Dividend yields in the 2% to 6% range are considered ideal. Dividends yielding more than 6% are generally considered at risk.\n\nAnd while dividend yields are one way of measuring risk, there are plenty of others. Payout ratio is one which is particularly useful. It measures the amount of profits a company pays out as dividends. Ratios between 35% to 55% are considered healthy.\n\nEach of the at-risk dividend stocks discussed below deviates from one or both of those healthy ranges. So, as appealing as they may be to income investors seeking dividend cash, they\u2019re probably too risky because either their share price, dividend or both are at risk of falling further.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NYSE:WBA) is a well-known pharmaceutical retailer with a stock that is headed in the wrong direction. In fact, WBA shares have fallen from $26 to below $16 in 2024.\n\nI think Walgreens Boots Alliance is primarily at risk of further share price deterioration due to recent dividend reductions. Walgreens Boots Alliance had long been a member of the Dividend Aristocrats \u2014 companies that have increased their dividend for 25 consecutive years \u2014 but reduced its dividend in January, shocking investors. Prior to that, the company last reduced its dividend in 1976.\n\nThat is troublesome enough but the other problem with Walgreens Boots Alliance and the reason investors should avoid it entirely has to do with its lack of competitiveness. The company simply does not derive high margins from its sales. It isn\u2019t competitive relative to others within its industry.\n\nForbes recently compared Walgreens to CVS (NYSE:CVS) and found CVS outperforms it on a number of important metrics. Surprisingly, Forbes also suggested it expects WBA to outperform CVS in the future solely because it is relatively underpriced compared to its rival. That logic is entirely backward. WBA shares are cheaper than those from CVS precisely because it underperforms, not because it\u2019s been unfairly maligned.\n\nService Properties Trust (SVC) tiny house figures atop letter blocks spelling out REIT, representing reits to buy. stock predictions. best REITs\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nService Properties Trust (NASDAQ:SVC) stock represents a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on hotels and service-related properties. The company continues on a long-term decline, which will affect its dividend again at some point or another.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe most dramatic decline for the stock occurred in 2020 at the onset of the pandemic. Revenues declined by more than 45% that year sending shares tumbling from $22 to $5. However, the stock had been trending downward for the previous five years as well. So, it\u2019s not as if Service Properties Trust simply was a victim of the pandemic.\n\nThe global health crisis prompted a dividend reduction in 2021. The company has not been able to regain net overall profitability since the pandemic. While the company continues to pay dividends, the funds from operations (FFO) from which dividends are paid, declined by 43% in the most recent quarter. Normalized FFO was $0.13 per share in Q1 but distributions amounted to $0.20 per share. That is unsustainable.\n\nAGNC Investment (AGNC) Real estate investment trust (REIT) on a black notebook on an office desk.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAGNC Investment (NASDAQ:AGNC) is another REIT stock that investors should be wary of. The firm provides capital for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) guaranteed by the U.S. government. That\u2019s the same investment vehicle that proved so disastrous not so many years ago.\n\nThere are legitimate reasons to believe that AGNC stock will punish shareholders again. Previously I mentioned the payout ratio is an excellent predictor of the overall health of a given dividend. However, it isn\u2019t particularly applicable to REITs. So, AGNC Investment\u2019s payout ratio of 1.58 doesn\u2019t mean the company is necessarily unhealthy.\n\nFor REITs we must instead look at funds from operations (FFO) as a predictor of dividend stability. That\u2019s where the problem emerges. The company\u2019s FFO is all over the place. One quarter it\u2019s positive, the next it\u2019s negative.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to be wary of AGNC Investment because of the history of mortgage-backed securities. If that isn\u2019t enough to scare you away, simply look at the unpredictable FFO from the company.\n\nKohl\u2019s (KSS) Image of Kohl's logo on a Kohl's store\n\nSource: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.com\n\nKohl\u2019s (NYSE:KSS) stock is probably best avoided. The well-known department store retailer operates in a sensitive consumer discretionary sector and has not been doing well for several years.\n\nA cursory view of Kohl\u2019s performance hisotry should give investors a few strong clues as to why it\u2019s to be avoided, especially for income investors. The stock\u2019s dividend yield is near 9% at the moment which is generally considered to be unhealthy. Its payout ratio is also above the healthy range, at 0.81.\n\nThat means 81% of earnings are directed toward paying dividends. That is simply too high and especially so given the poor operational performance of Kohl\u2019s overall. The company could certainly redirect those earnings toward improvements otherwise.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s really strange about Kohl\u2019s: The company\u2019s best year of late came in 2021 when revenues grew by more than 20%. That was the only year of the past five in which Kohl\u2019s showed overall revenue growth. However, the company also reduced its dividend in 2021. There\u2019s simply too much variance in Kohl\u2019s operations.\n\nArdagh Metal Packaging (AMBP) close-up of aluminum cans in assembly line\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/MOLPIX\n\nArdagh Metal Packaging (NYSE:AMBP) makes metal beverage cans used for beer, soft drinks, and all other beverages. The stock also provides a dividend yielding more than 10%, making it attractive to income investors.\n\nThe dividend has yielded more than 15% at times within the last few years. That level of yield will certainly entice some investors. However, Ardagh Metal Packaging also reduced its dividend in 2022, suggesting it isn\u2019t dependable overall.\n\nThe primary reason is Ardagh\u2019s debt. The can maker\u00a0doesn\u2019t have enough capital to cover its interest, which is highly concerning. That is leading the company into a vicious cycle by which it issues additional debt in order to make up the difference.\n\nHigh-risk-seeking investors might enjoy the roller coaster ride the stock will offer. Those who can sit back and collect a 10% return from dividends alone could certainly make out well. However, the company\u2019s poor operations mean it\u2019s likely to reduce that dividend again at some point. Once it does, there\u2019s no reason to be invested in Ardagh Metal Packaging.\n\nBrandywine Realty Trust (BDN) Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room. commercial real estate\n\nSource: GaudiLab / Shutterstock\n\nBrandywine Realty Trust (NYSE:BDN) is an office REIT stock, which will automatically raise warning alarms for many investors. Urbanization trends partially due to other trends such as remote work have introduced substantial risk to office REIT stocks.\n\nRevenue growth was under 2% throughout 2023. Overall though, it was positive, marking the second consecutive year of revenue growth for the company. Prior to that, Brandywine Realty Trust had seen its revenues decline in each of the previous two years.\n\nDespite modest revenue growth, the company reported a net loss in excess of $197 million in 2023. Net income is particularly concerning and is highly variable. To put a fine point on the stock, it\u2019s very difficult to find a rational business case for investing in Brandywine Realty Trust. Yes, the dividend currently offers a forward yield of 13.23% but it was reduced in 2023. The payout\u2019s continued payment is hardly a foregone conclusion.\n\nFor now, Brandywine Realty Trust\u2019s FFO continues to cover its dividend payouts. However, the combination of net losses that tripled in Q1, declining overall funds from operations and overarching concerns related to office REITs makes BDN too risky. The 13.2% dividend looks like a siren song to me.\n\nB&G Foods (BGS) On a white table sits bowls of nuts, fruit, and seeds, while vegetables like brocolli, carrots, and mushrooms sit on the table\n\nSource: Tatjana Baibakova / Shutterstock\n\nB&G Foods (NYSE:BGS) is a packaged food manufacturer with a stock offering a dividend yielding 8.1% at the moment.\n\nThere are several indications that the dividend is unsustainable. For one, it was recently reduced in 2023. It\u2019s also been shrinking over the past five years at an annual rate of more than 13%. If those two factors weren\u2019t enough to dissuade some investors, its payout ratio should be. That ratio sits at 0.84, meaning 84% of earnings are directed toward dividend payments.\n\nIf the company\u2019s overall business were improving then perhaps it would be logical to try to find a silver lining. However, B&G Foods has real problems that show up on the income statement under other operating expenses. These costs have ballooned over the past two fiscal years.\n\nB&G doesn\u2019t break them out in detail so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what is going on. However, the net effect is the company has been losing money over the past two years, whereas it hadn\u2019t been prior.\u00a0That puts the dividend at further risk in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Time to Pounce: 2 Beaten-Down, High-Yield Nasdaq-100 Stocks That Are Begging to Be Bought Right Now",
        "content": "Over the last century, no asset class has generated a higher average annual return than stocks. With thousands of publicly traded companies and exchange-traded funds for investors to choose from, investors of all walks and risk tolerances are likely to find a security that meets their goals and grows their wealth.\n\nBut among the countless strategies investors have at their disposal, few have been more successful than buying and holding dividend stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nLast year, the investment advisors at Hartford Funds released an extensive report (\"The Power of Dividends: Past, Present, and Future\") that examined the outperformance of dividend stocks over the last half century (1973-2023). In a collaboration with Ned Davis Research, Hartford Funds found that dividend stocks more than doubled the average annual return of non-payers over 50 years: 9.17% versus 4.27%.\n\nAdditionally, dividend-paying stocks have proved to be less volatile. While the non-payers were 18% more volatile than the S&P 500 and produced modest returns over 50 years, the dividend stocks were 6% less volatile than the benchmark index. Companies that regularly share a percentage of their profits with investors tend to be profitable on a recurring basis and time-tested -- thus, the lower volatility.\n\nWhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are known for their dividend-paying companies, you might be surprised to learn that the growth-focused Nasdaq-100 is home to a number of fantastic income stocks, as well.\n\nRight now, two beaten-down, high-yield Nasdaq-100 stocks are ripe for the picking and begging to be bought by opportunistic investors. Note: \"high-yield\" refers to any stock whose yield is at least two times higher than the current yield of the S&P 500 (1.34%, as of June 14, 2024).\n\nTime to pounce: Starbucks (2.9% yield)\n\nThe first high-octane Nasdaq-100 income stock that's makes for a no-brainer right now is global coffee chain Starbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX). Shares of the company have declined by 37% since hitting an all-time high in 2021, which has, in turn, lifted its dividend yield to nearly 3%. SBUX Dividend Chart\n\nThere's no beating around the bush that Starbucks' fiscal second-quarter operating results stunk. Starbucks has a lengthy track record of blowing Wall Street's generally conservative growth estimates out of the water. But the coffee behemoth reported a global same-store sales decline of 4% and, once more, lowered its full-year sales forecast for fiscal 2024, which'll end in late September.\n\nThe culprits for this weakness look to be a combination of higher input costs (both labor and coffee), the company's new drinks not resonating with consumers, and China's economic rebound from three years of stringent COVID-19 lockdowns taking longer than expected. While there are no excuses to be made, none of these headwinds are long-term in nature.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, Starbucks has an exceptionally loyal customer base. The company closed out March with 32.8 million active Rewards Members in the U.S., which is up 6% from the prior-year period. Rewards Members usually spend more per ticket than non-members, and they're likelier to lean on mobile ordering and store their credit card information on their smartphone. Simple things like mobile ordering and storing payment information on smartphones expedites in-store lines and makes Starbucks' stores more efficient over time.\n\nTo add to this point, Starbucks has never been afraid to increase the price of its beverages or food items to counter rising costs. Having a loyal customer base makes it easy for the company to fight back against inflation and the occasional minor dip in foot traffic.\n\nSales weakness in China isn't something to be overly concerned about yet, either. It's going to take time for China's economy to work out the supply chain kinks that have followed three years of very stringent provincial pandemic lockdowns. As China's middle class finds its footing, there's likely to be a greater incentive for these consumers to revisit their local Starbucks.\n\nHowever, the top reason to trust in Starbucks over the long run is its innovative capacity. A perfect example being Starbucks completely overhauling its drive-thru ordering boards during the pandemic. It installed video to personalize the drive-thru experience, as well as promoted high-margin drink and food pairings on its ordering boards. The company has also been tinkering with new food items to encourage the lunch crowd to visit its stores.\n\nAlthough Starbucks is working through an undeniable grind at the moment, the company has a history of using drink, food, and technological innovations to drive foot traffic into its stores. The company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 20 marks a decade low and represents a 30% discount to its average forward P/E multiple over the last five years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTime to pounce: Walgreens Boots Alliance (6.4% yield)\n\nThe other beaten-down, high-yield Nasdaq-100 stock that opportunistic investors can pounce on right now is pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA). Shares of Walgreens have plummeted by 84% since hitting an all-time of high nearly $100 per share in 2015.\n\nWalgreens has been contending with no shortage of headwinds over the last couple of years. It's facing growing online pharmacy competition, has dealt with litigation regarding its role in the opioid crisis, and is attempting to dig its way out of a mountain of debt. The company's dividend was also reduced by nearly 50% in January 2024. Long story short, there are viable reasons why Walgreens' stock is struggling.\n\nAlthough turnarounds for brick-and-mortar retailers aren't short-term events, the framework is being laid for Walgreens Boots Alliance stock to eventually do a 180 for value- and income-seeking investors.\n\nAs I've previously pointed out, the most-important of all changes undertaken by Walgreens was the hiring of Tim Wentworth as CEO. Wentworth is the former CEO of pharmacy-benefit management company Express Scripts, as well as Evernorth, Cigna's health-services organization. The key point being that Wentworth has an extensive background in healthcare, which is something former CEO Rosalind Brewer lacked. With an experienced CEO in place, Wentworth can tackle Walgreens' problems head-on.\n\nAs is to be expected with any turnaround, Walgreens is tightening its belt. After successfully reducing its operating expenses by $2 billion, as of the end of fiscal 2021 (the company's fiscal year ends on August 31), the new plan is to increase annual cost savings to an aggregate of $4.1 billion. Cost-cutting should improve margins and allow the company to whittle down some of its outstanding debt.\n\nI'll add to the above that selling non-core assets is also on the table to reduce debt. There's speculation that Walgreens may opt to sell its Boots franchise in the U.K., which would improve the financial flexibility of its balance sheet.\n\nBut there's more to this turnaround than just cutting costs. Walgreens' management team has been willing to spend aggressively on a variety of digital initiatives. In particular, the company has revamped its supply chain and built out its online website. Even though its physical stores generate the bulk of its sales, direct-to-consumer sales offer a path to sustained organic growth.\n\nThe other big change is Walgreens Boots Alliance's shift to healthcare services. While moving into new verticals has a learning curve -- the company took a hefty non-cash writedown on its investment in VillageMD in its most recent quarter -- it's a smart move for a company aiming to improve customer loyalty at the grassroots level.\n\nThough things may look bleak on paper for Walgreens Boots Alliance, the company's transformation efforts are well underway. At roughly 5 times forward-year earnings, and with a 6.4% yield in tow (the highest yield in the Nasdaq-100), all the negative news (and some) appears to be fully baked into the company's prospects.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Starbucks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Starbucks wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company's earnings report is set to go public on June 27, 2024. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.68, down 32% from the prior-year quarter.

The question is whether there is some bad news lurking behind the good.\n\nPart of the reason inflation is returning to normal levels is that supply chain distortions dating to the 2020 COVID pandemic are finally ironed out. But there could be more worrisome trends, such as consumers becoming more sensitive to prices as they deplete their savings and worry more about job security.\n\nRetailers such as Walmart, Target, and Walgreens are starting to cut prices on thousands of everyday items. They\u2019re not doing this to be nice. Everybody who sells anything in a capitalist economy wants to charge the highest price they can get, and that\u2019s what retailers have been doing for the last few years. Shoppers grumbled about higher prices, but for the most part, they paid up.\n\nNow, shoppers are getting a lot pickier. That\u2019s how supply and demand is supposed to work, but this also coincides with declining savings and other signs of consumer stress. The \u201cexcess savings\u201d many families accumulated during the COVID lockdowns are now fully depleted, according to the San Francisco Federal Reserve. The personal savings rate, which was around 7% prior to COVID, has dropped to 3.6%.\n\nThere was also a notable uptick in the number of people filing for unemployment insurance in the latest weekly report, with the number of filers reaching a 10-month high. And the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer confidence index dropped to a seven-month low. That\u2019s an eyebrow-raiser because the Michigan index focuses heavily on inflation, and the inflation rate is down to a manageable 3.3%. Gas prices have been falling too, which usually buoys consumer spirits. Motorist pass posted gas prices, Monday, June 10, 2024, in San Antonio. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nNot this time. \u201cHouseholds are now struggling more under the weight of higher interest rates and still-elevated consumer prices,\u201d Capital Economics reported on June 14. \u201cThe gradual rise in initial jobless claims, elevated job cut announcements, and the decline in job openings may be affecting sentiment.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not yet time to ring the recession alarm. Most economists think the economy will continue to grow for the rest of the year and employers will continue to hire. Goldman Sachs, for instance, expects GDP growth of 2% in the fourth quarter of 2024. A cooling economy might even allow the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by the fall and juice spending a little.\n\nThere have been many predictions of a recession during Biden\u2019s presidency, especially after the Fed started jacking up interest rates in 2022 to tackle inflation. Rising rates are intended to slow the economy, and sometimes they\u2019re a little too effective, slowing growth so much that the economy shrinks and unemployment jumps.\n\nStory continues\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened this time around, but that\u2019s no guarantee it won\u2019t. \u201cComplacency sets in as the recession does not take hold in the data, but then the recession eventually does show up and comes as a huge surprise,\" David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research wrote on June 14. \u201cThe recession has indeed been delayed again, but it has not been derailed in our view.\u201d\n\nBiden needs a break on the economy, one of several areas where his approval rating lags that of Donald Trump, his Republican rival in the 2024 presidential race. Inflation has been gradually slowing since it peaked at 9% in 2022, with some prices finally starting to decline. The timing seems good for Biden, especially if gas prices stay steady or decline heading into the fall. The last undecided swing voters would be choosing their candidate as they watch staples get more affordable.\n\nBut if inflation is falling because consumers are under mounting financial stress, that would be too much of a good thing. Voters are already edgy about the economy and Biden needs to ease their concerns. If they start to worry about jobs on top of inflation, he\u2019ll have a tough sell in the home stretch of the election.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 June 13, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights AT&T T, Verizon VZ, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA and Apple AAPL.\n\nCheaper Isn't Always Better: How to Avoid the Stock Value Trap\n\nThe term \u201cvalue trap\u201d refers to a stock that has a low valuation in terms of classic fundamental metrics such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, pays a high dividend, yet is a poor investment that underperforms the market and is \u201cdead money.\u201d\n\nTo understand value traps, investors should consider the old saying, \u201cYou get what you pay for.\u201d Though my mother always taught me to be frugal as a kid, she also emphasized that I should not be cheap. For example, if you buy nice clothing made from better material, you will take care of it, enjoy it more, and it will last longer. The same applies to the stock market because, often, cheaper is not better.\n\nWhat Are the Signs of a Value Trap?\n\nTo understand value traps, I will break down some classic signs and cover some examples to prove my points.\n\n1. \u201cCheap\u201d Valuation\n\nAs I mentioned, value traps are cheap based on traditional metrics, such as price-to-earnings, price-to-sales, or price-to-book ratios. However, investors need to understand that a low valuation is not bearish but it is not necessarily bullish either. Like most investing metrics, context matters.\n\nFor example, telecom giant AT&T has a valuation of 7.75, which is roughly a third of the S&P 500 Index\u2019s 24.4 P/E.\n\nDespite the low P/E (which has been lower than the S&P 500 for years), AT&T is down 25%, while the S&P 500 is up 25% over the past five years.\n\n2. Stagnant Earnings Growth\n\nIf AT&T is so cheap, then why are shares underperforming? The answer lies in slowing earnings growth. AT&T\u2019s quarterly EPS was as high as $0.90 in 2019 but it has steadily declined to $0.55 last quarter.\n\n3. Industry Out of Favor\n\nA stock\u2019s industry group plays a critical role in its performance. AT&T is not the only stock performing poorly in the communications industry; Verizon has also performed poorly. Investors should seek disruptors and avoid legacy industries. For example, Advanced Micro Devices, a beneficiary of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, grew earnings by 159% last quarter. Amateur investors must learn that Institutional investors will pay a premium for growth, especially in bull markets.\n\n4. A High Dividend Yield Is a Trade Off\n\nNew, inexperienced investors often get sucked into buying a stock because it has a high dividend. Pharmacy company Walgreens Boots Alliance is a perfect example of why a high dividend does not ensure \u201csafety\u201d or steadiness in a stock. WBA pays a juicy 6% dividend, yet shares are down 46% over the past year!\n\nStory continues\n\n5. Caretaker Management\n\nInvestors must be vigilant regarding new management teams. All else equal, founder-led companies perform well until the founder leaves, and usually stagnate after. That\u2019s because founders have \u201cskin in the game\u201d and are not afraid to take risks. Conversely, when a new CEO takes over an existing and successful company, their mindset tends to shift from growth-oriented to capital preservation-focused (or what I call caretaker management).\n\nApple is a current example of caretaker management. With Steve Jobs at the helm, the Apple team was expected to innovate, speed up growth, and launch new products. Meanwhile, with Tim Cook as CEO of Apple, innovation has slowed, and capital preservation has become the goal. For instance, instead of trying to break into the EV market, Cook decided to sunset Apple\u2019s EV program. Instead, the company is hoarding cash and buying back AAPL shares in an attempt to prop them up.\n\nGARP: A Happy Medium\n\nThe goal of this commentary is not to make investors avoid valuation at all but rather approach it intelligently. One method of doing this is to take a GARP (Growth at a Reasonable Price Approach). In this method, investors seek moderate growth (low double digits), with a reasonable p/e.\n\nValue Trap Caveat: Brutal Bear Markets\n\nBuying value traps in a bull market is a sure-fire way to underperform. However, a bear market environment (which I define as the S&P below the 200-day) is a time when investors seek stability and cash-rich companies like Verizon or AT&T. As a result, investors must understand how to diagnose the market\u2019s health.\n\nBottom Line\n\nCheap valuations do not automatically make a stock a \u201cvalue proposition.\u201d In fact, investors who chase low valuation stocks will often get caught in value traps and underperform the market.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Goods inflation is finally fixed",
        "content": "Wall Street cheered the latest inflation report, which showed prices rose less than expected from April to May. Stocks jumped a snappy 1% on the news.\n\nConsumers should be cheered, too. One month\u2019s worth of economic numbers won\u2019t automatically ease the pressure on the family budget, but one important trend is convincingly going the right direction: Inflation in goods is finally getting back to normal.\n\nInflation came unleashed around this time three years ago, as vaccines helped end the COVID pandemic, cooped-up consumers started going out again, and trillions of dollars in stimulus money turbocharged spending. Since that coincided with Joe Biden\u2019s presidential term, many Americans blame Biden for eroding spending power. But it was mostly COVID-related factors that pushed goods prices up.\n\nThe pandemic triggered a huge shift in spending away from services toward goods since it was hard to travel or eat out but easy to order stuff online. Supply chain snafus also made some products scarce, and demand-supply imbalances sent prices soaring. In March of 2022, the one-year inflation rate for goods peaked at a whopping 14.2%.\n\nThe annual inflation rate for goods is now 0.1%. What matters most to consumers isn\u2019t the inflation number attached to any particular product; it\u2019s how much their paycheck buys. Here, the news is good too. During the last three years, the cost of all goods combined has risen by 14%. Earnings have risen by 14.9%. So goods are no longer taking an inordinately large bite out of the typical paycheck as they have been for much of the last two years.\n\nYes yes yes, some prices are still elevated, as the following chart shows. Food and energy are still up by more than earnings during the last three years. Those are staples that are hard to cut back on.\n\nBut other things have gone up in price by less than earnings, such as clothing, furniture, and appliances. The cost of electronics and toys actually declined during the last three years. People don\u2019t need to buy a new toaster or pair of shoes every month, but everybody needs to buy this kind of stuff sooner or later. Disinflation and deflation do help family budgets, even for non-staples.\n\nThere\u2019s more evidence that commodity prices should continue to moderate and, in some cases, decline. Gasoline prices, perhaps the best consumer proxy for overall inflation, have dropped since the government gathered the data on May inflation to a national average of around $3.45 per gallon.\n\nRetailers are cutting prices on thousands of items as shoppers get pickier and refuse to pony up for some things. Target (TGT), Walgreens (WBA), Ikea, Walmart (WMT), and other big chains have announced price cuts recently. McDonald\u2019s (MCD), Burger King, and KFC (YUM) have new bargain meal options. If the job market continues to soften, as many economists expect, that will cool demand even more and cement the return of goods inflation to normal levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nAlas, inflation is not completely tamed. The overall inflation rate is now 3.3%, a huge improvement from the 9% peak in June 2022. But the Federal Reserve\u2019s target is 2%, and nobody complained during pre-COVID times when it was a bit lower than that.\n\nThe bogeyman is now services, in particular just a few service categories. Services inflation is 5.2%, still well above the Fed\u2019s target. During the last three years, the cost of all services combined rose by 18.3%, a bit more than incomes.\n\nRent is the big one, with rental inflation running 5.3% year over year. During the last three years, rents have risen 20.4%, 5.5 percentage points more than earnings. Since housing is most people\u2019s biggest expense, that has been a budget killer. Slashing prices: Retailers, including Walmart and Target, are stepping up discounting heading into the summer of 2024 as they hope to offer frustrated shoppers some relief from higher prices. (AP Photo/Eduardo Munoz Alvarez.) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nRestaurant meals are up by 21% during the last three years, in part because a shortage of workers has pushed up wages, with the cost passed on to consumers. We didn\u2019t put auto insurance on the chart above because it would skew the scale, but those costs have soared by 47.1% since 2021, largely because fancier cars cost a lot more to fix and drivers are getting into more crashes.\n\nThe trend in services is also going the right way, however. The government\u2019s measure of rent prices doesn\u2019t take into account new leases, and many economists expect rent inflation to moderate during the coming months.\n\nThe Apartment List rental index, which does account for new leases, shows a modest decline in rents from the peak levels of 2022. The latest monthly report describes the rental market as \u201csluggish,\u201d with \u201cseasonal declines steeper than usual and seasonal increases more mild.\u201d That means renters ought to have more leverage to negotiate cheaper rent when current leases expire.\n\nAs economists and politicians have learned, however, everybody has their own personal measure of inflation and rising prices can cause lasting consumer shell shock. Though the numbers show improvement, it could still be a while before Americans' estimation of the economy inflates.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) closed at $15.94, marking a +0.63% move from the previous day. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.26%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.18%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.35%.\n\nShares of the largest U.S. drugstore chain witnessed a loss of 7.85% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Retail-Wholesale sector with its loss of 0.54% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.25%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Walgreens Boots Alliance in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on June 27, 2024. On that day, Walgreens Boots Alliance is projected to report earnings of $0.68 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 32%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $35.96 billion, up 1.55% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $3.21 per share and revenue of $145.92 billion, which would represent changes of -19.35% and +4.91%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Walgreens Boots Alliance. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends.

        "title": "Is Now the Time to Buy 3 of the S&amp;P 500's Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks?",
        "content": "Dividend stocks help you to make money with no effort on your part. And that passive income can be incredibly powerful if it's reinvested long-term and piles up over the years. It's also a big part of why high-yielding dividend stocks can be particularly enticing, as they provide investors with more bang for their investment bucks.\n\nBut high yields also tend to come with increased risk. Three of the highest-yielding dividend payers among stocks in the S&P 500 today are Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), Altria Group (NYSE: MO), and Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ). These stocks provide plenty of dividend income for investors right now compared to the S&P 500 average. But their yields are high for a reason (or multiple reasons) which isn't necessarily good.\n\nIs it worth adding these three S&P 500 dividend payers to your portfolio today? Or is there too much risk involved with their high payouts?\n\n1. Walgreens Boots Alliance: 6.3% dividend yield\n\nWalgreens' dividend is one of the main reasons investors have owned shares of the pharmacy retailer over the years. It's also why the stock has been a bad buy of late. Investors grew concerned that the payout wasn't sustainable.\n\nAt the start of the year, management confirmed the worst when it announced a dividend cut, slashing the quarterly dividend by 48%. Up to that point, the stock had an annual dividend growth streak going which spanned decades. It was on track to be a Dividend King in a few years.\n\nUnfortunately, even with the reduced dividend, investors shouldn't have much confidence that the reduced payout is sustainable. In the trailing 12 months, Walgreens incurred an operating loss of more than $2 billion. Going forward, it faces a tough road as it continues investing in a costly plan to open hundreds of primary care clinics at its retail locations.\n\nThe stock hasn't been this cheap for decades, and there's good reason for it -- Walgreens comes with massive risk right now, and it's not a stock dividend investors should feel comfortable relying on.\n\n2. Altria: 8.4% dividend yield\n\nTobacco giant Altria entices investors with an even higher yield on its dividend payouts. Unlike Walgreens, it continues to increase its dividend annually. Last year, the company boosted its quarterly payout by 4.3%, marking the 58th dividend hike it has made in 54 years. As with Walgreens, the dividend provided a big reason for investing in an income stock that didn't have much in the way of stock price appreciation.\n\nThere are some warning signs to consider with this dividend payer. The company's payout ratio is a bit high at more than 80% of earnings (although it has been at this level for several years now). Altria's revenue has also declined for the past two years, and that seems to be the case again this year. In the first quarter, net revenue was down 2.5% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAltria is trying to transition to new revenue streams to replace the shrinking revenue from cigarette sales and get its growth story going again. Consumers continue to move away from tobacco products. Recent data suggests that globally, just 1-in-5 adults use tobacco now, compared to 1-in-3 back in 2000.\n\nWhile Altria's dividend appears to be safe for the time being, it may only be a matter of time before it too has to consider reducing its payout. This is another risky stock that may not be suitable for income investors with a long-term investment mindset.\n\n3. Verizon Communications: 6.5% dividend yield\n\nTelecom giant Verizon hasn't been increasing its dividend payments for as long as Altria, but it can rightly be called a solid dividend growth stock. Last year, it extended its streak of annual dividend increases to 17 years.\n\nIts payout ratio sits at around 100% right now, which may be unnerving to income investors. But that ratio calculation was affected by a one-time $5.8 billion goodwill writedown in the fourth quarter which affected earnings.  The more important metric to note is that Verizon generated $13.4 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, which exceeds the $11.1 billion it has paid out in dividends during that time. Free cash can be a better indicator of how sustainable a dividend is, since it excludes non-cash items such as impairment, as well as depreciation and amortization.\n\nAlthough business isn't taking off for Verizon by any stretch, the company does expect to see between 2% and 3.5% wireless service revenue growth this year.\n\nThe stock trades at just 9 times its expected future profits, making it an attractive value buy. Verizon's business still looks to be in good shape, and it's the only stock on this list I'd consider buying for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Stocks to Watch &amp; One to Avoid From the Volatile Retail Pharmacy Industry",
        "content": "In the middle of the ongoing trend of digitalization within the healthcare product supply side, there has been a significant shift toward digital consumption of healthcare products and services as well. Amid acute supply-chain disruption and staffing shortages within healthcare, the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry is witnessing exponentially growing demand for distant medical services and remote patient care. Further, mail-order pharmacies are registering growth by adopting digital health services in the form of telehealth and remote monitoring. With digitization, retail industry players are also significantly strengthening their omnichannel presence from sole brick-and-mortar dependency. All these are creating unique opportunities for industry stalwarts like Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA and Herbalife Ltd HLF, which are investing strategically in easy patient access to prescription and maintenance medications.\r\n\r\nHowever, the majority of the retail pharmacy and drug store heavyweights have been southbound due to the ongoing pressure of rising expenses and labor shortages. Further, under the ongoing stringent monetary policy, consumers have limited money to spend, which is leading to a decline in retail pharmacy products. Added to this, unfavorable drug pricing and reimbursement are a burden on this sector. CVS Health CVS is one such stock whose performance is negatively impacted by these industry-wide trends. Last but not the least, perceiving the huge growth prospects of this space, there have been a number of new entries that have increased competition in the space. In particular, a stalwart like Amazon\u2019s AMZN strict domination within the retail drugstore space has created a survival issue for the existing entities.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry includes retailing of a range of prescription and over-the-counter medications. The broad retail network of companies within the retail pharmacy industry delivers advanced health solutions to patients, customers and caregivers. Over the past few years, the scope of the retail pharmacy and drugstore market has expanded exponentially. In North America, some of these entities evolved to add wellness products and groceries to their traditional portfolio of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Looking at the attractive growth potential of this industry, non-healthcare leaders like Amazon acquired pharmacy delivery startup PillPack to enter the U.S. healthcare space.\n\n3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Industry\n\nMassive Digital Adoption: Thanks to the pandemic, there has been a significant shift in demand toward mail order and online pharmacies. Even now, when the pandemic is over, pharmacy retailers have been witnessing growing consumer preference for these alternative channels compared to brick-and-mortar pharmacies. The digital pharmacy market is rapidly gaining popularity in the form of improving access to physicians, diagnosis and treatments. Further, with the digitalization of drug stores, easy online purchases of medicines have gained popularity.\r\n\r\nAccording to an Insight Partners report, the digital pharmacy market size was valued at $96.4 billion in 2022. It is projected to reach a global market size of $363.9 billion by 2030. A 2023 pharmacy study by J.D. Power (as published in Progressive Grosser) noted that while customer reliance on digital platforms was 76% in 2022, the same shot up to 81% in 2023.\r\n\r\nAmazon Steals Market Share: Amazon Pharmacy\u2019s omnichannel performance has been significantly robust since its inception. Going by a Viseven report of 2023, Amazon\u2019s omnichannel experiences are the keystone to customer retention, helping it cover previous sales reductions. This has significantly increased competition in the retail pharmacy market. In March 2024, Amazon Pharmacy announced same-day delivery of prescription medication in New York City and the greater LA area, with plans to expand the service to more than a dozen U.S. cities by the end of the year. In October 2023, Amazon Pharmacy announced the launch of a drone delivery service. Amazon Pharmacy is currently using generative artificial intelligence to fill prescriptions more quickly and accurately.\r\n\r\nFollowing its entry into the healthcare market, the e-commerce giant has grabbed a significant chunk of the online pharmacy market.\u00a0 With several other initiatives in progress, needless to say, Amazon\u2019s emergence as a major pharmacy services player is a significant blow to the industry, putting retail pharmacy and drugstore stocks in a tighter spot.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Difficult Pharmacy Reimbursement Scenario: Brand-name drugs that hold wide profit margins are protected with a reliable supply chain. However, low-margin generic drugs, which have a fragile supply-chain network, have been bearing the brunt of the ongoing economic slump. Drug retailers are also witnessing a constant rise in medicine prices, stemming from the rising cost of raw materials. The industry players are currently grappling with continued pressure from non-reimbursable pharmacy expenses, which are significantly pulling down mass demand for prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs and vaccinations.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, to improve operating margins, pharmacy retailers have announced plans to reduce their footprint. In December 2023, CVS Health stated that it would change the way it prices its prescription drugs with new pharmacy reimbursement.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Near-Term Prospects\n\nThe industry\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, housed within the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #227, placing it in the bottom 8% of more than 248 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nWe will present a few stocks that have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. However, it\u2019s worth taking a look at the industry\u2019s shareholder returns and current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Underperforms S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite as well as its sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 23% over this period against the Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s growth of 23.6%. The S&P 500 composite has risen 23.2% over the said time frame.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 7.46X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 20.90X and the sector\u2019s 22.86X.\n\nOver the last five years, the sector has traded as high as 11.88X, as low as 7.18X, and at the median of 8.98X, as the charts below show.\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)\n\n2 Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Stocks in Focus & 1 to Avoid\n\nWalgreens Boots continued to transform the method of delivering healthcare through physical stores and digital channels. The company\u2019s network of micro fulfillment centers is helping to stabilize staffing and pharmacy hours, reduce work full pain points and free up capacity to drive the outcomes that matter most to its patients and partners. WBA is also piloting a virtual pharmacy to redefine connected care, increase patient access, enhance workplace flexibility and extend its pharmacist reach.\u00a0 At present, Walgreens Boots\u2019 11 micro-fulfillment centers support 4,600 stores.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues indicates growth of 4.9% from the 2023 reported figure. The company\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 5%. Walgreens Boots carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.  You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nPrice and Consensus: WBA\n\nHerbalife, as a premier health and wellness company and community, offers science-backed products to consumers in more than 90 markets through entrepreneurial distributors. It provides products in the areas of weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports and fitness, outer nutrition, and literature and promotion items. The company is currently expanding in the United Kingdom and Spain, banking on the rollout of an all-new distributor e-commerce platform built on Herbalife One. The company\u2019s new restructuring plan to streamline organizational structure (with expected annual cost savings of at least $80 million beginning 2025 and approximately $40 million in 2024) buoys optimism.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues indicates growth of 3.9% from the 2024 projected figure. The company\u2019s 2025 earnings growth rate is 33.5% from the 2024 projected figure. Herbalife carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nPrice and Consensus: HLF\n\nCVS Health is committed to increasing investments in fast-growing spaces like enterprise data platforms, cloud capabilities and digital products to offer innovative solutions through mobile and web channels. However, recent challenges in Medicare Advantage mar CVS Health\u2019s profitability. The company\u2019s healthcare benefits segment costs soared much faster due to increased Medicare utilization and a decline in the company's Medicare Advantage star ratings. The company\u2019s health services segment faced headwinds in the form of the loss of a large client and continued pharmacy client price improvements. The downward revision in the 2024 outlook looks worrisome.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings estimates indicates an 18.4% plunge from the 2023 level. CVS Health, which presently holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), delivered a trailing four-quarter average negative earnings surprise of 2.3%.\n\nPrice and Consensus: CVS\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Costco Gobbles Discretionary Market Share Thanks To Its Value Proposition\n\nLast week, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) reported its fiscal third quarter earnings that surpassed estimates.\u00a0Last Thursday, Costco management emphasized\u00a0its membership pricing, digital sales growth,\u00a0along with its\u00a0recently expanded partnership with Uber\u00a0Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER).\n\nFiscal Third Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on May 12, Costco recorded revenue\u00a0grew 9% YoY to\u00a0$58.52 billion,\u00a0earning\u00a0$3.78\u00a0per share. Excluding gasoline and foreign exchange impact, comparable sales, rose 6.5%.\u00a0E-commerce sales\u00a0surged\u00a020.7%powered by\u00a0gold and silver bullion, gift cards and appliances.\u00a0Membership fees\u00a0brought about\u00a0$1.23 billion\u00a0to the revenue table, rising\u00a07.6%\u00a0YoY.\n\nLowering Prices Bodes Well For Costco\n\nLike its peers, Target (NYSE: TGT), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) and Walmart (NYSE: WMT) Costco has lowered prices over the quarter\u00a0to boost discretionary spending.\u00a0Walgreens Boots Alliance even slashed its full-year earnings outlook\u00a0in response to a\u00a0challenging retail environment in the US.\u00a0Target is also expecting another slow year after reporting its 2023 sales fell for the first time since 2016.\u00a0Over the past few weeks, even the mighty e-commerce titan Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) joined Walmart and Target in slashing prices on thousands of household goods. Back in May, Target announced it\u00a0is slashing prices on 5,000 items, after already lowering\u00a0prices on 1,500 items\u00a0in an effort to\u00a0boost consumer spending. As the lower average cost per item is key to Costco\u2019s\u00a0value proposition\u00a0when it comes to buying in bulk, lowering prices even further could further fuel\u00a0sales\u00a0and unsurprisingly, Costco\u00a0plans to continue doing so.\u00a0In their recent earnings report, both Target and Walmart noted a pullback in discretionary spending, while Costco's value and unique deals have given way to more discretionary spending and a larger market share.\n\nCostco is waiting for the right time to raise membership prices.\n\nThroughout most of its history,\u00a0Costco\u00a0has been raising\u00a0its membership prices every five years on average, but it's now been nearly seven years since its last price hike and Costco is still keeping them steady.\u00a0At the end of the third quarter,\u00a0Costco had 74.5 million members, up from 73.4 million last quarter\u00a0and\u00a069.1 million\u00a0from last year\u2019s comparable quarter, reporting\u00a0about a million more\u00a0memberships\u00a0than analysts had expected. Costco is not willing to risk these figures.\n\nStory continues\n\nCostco is determined to catch up on the digital front.\n\nCostco has\u00a0been working for a while\u00a0to catch up digitally after historically being slow to adapt to\u00a0new\u00a0trends, such as\u00a0online shopping. With its latest quarter, its\u00a0efforts\u00a0have started to pay off\u00a0with\u00a0e-commerce sales\u00a0growing\u00a020.7%YoY.\u00a0Along with Uber, Costco also has a yearslong partnership with Instacart (NASDAQ: CART). Through Instacart,\u00a0Costco\u00a0is\u00a0offering same-day\u00a0grocery delivery to customers.\u00a0Uber also recently\u00a0partnered with Instacart in\u00a0an effort to take down DoorDash (NASDAQ: DASH) and its higher-income suburban shoppers.\n\nPreviously, Uber Eats delivered Costco products\u00a0in test markets across\u00a0Texas, but the partnership recently expanded to 17 states in the U.S.\u00a0as well as\u00a0all of its Canadian locations. Uber and Costco aim to expand their alliance across the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0as well as\u00a0other international markets\u00a0where Costco is present. Being considered as the king of suburbia,\u00a0Costco is the perfect ally to Uber on its quest to conquer the suburbs. Excluding food court items,\u00a0Costco members and non-members will be able to purchase products,\u00a0while members will enjoy\u00a015% to 20% lower\u00a0pricing.\u00a0Costco members will also\u00a0gain\u00a0a 20% discount on an Uber One membership\u00a0that includes\u00a0free deliveries, discounts on certain purchases,\u00a0as well as\u00a0member pricing on rides.\n\nCosto continues to expand its store footprint across the U.S. and the globe.\n\nDuring the reported quarter,\u00a0Costco opened a pair of new locations in the U.S.\u00a0In the current, fourth quarter, it plans to open\u00a0a total of 12, having already opened two since the reported third quarter ended,\u00a0with nine new locations planned in the U.S. two in Japan and one in South Korea, which would imply\u00a029 new locations\u00a0during\u00a0the fiscal year.\n\nThe warehouse retailer is doing business as usual, while it continues to grow across the U.S . and beyond, gobbling market share,\u00a0with plenty of more room for growth ahead as Americans look for ways to save when buying home goods and discretionary items.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Time to Pounce: 2 Beaten-Down Ultra-High-Yield Dividend Stocks Begging to Be Bought in June",
        "content": "Over the last century, the stock market has stood on a pedestal above all other asset classes. While investing in Treasury bonds, housing, gold, and oil would have increased your nominal wealth, none of these other asset classes has come anywhere close to the average annual returns delivered by stocks over the very long term.\n\nWhat makes Wall Street so special is its diversity of investments. With thousands of publicly traded companies and exchange-traded funds to choose from, there's a really good chance there's an investment vehicle (or 10) to satisfy everyone's goals and level of risk tolerance.\n\nBut among these countless puzzle pieces, few strategies have been more consistently successful than buying and holding dividend stocks over extended timelines. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nLast year, investment advisory firm Hartford Funds issued a report (\"The Power of Dividends: Past, Present, and Future\") that analyzed the various ways dividend stocks have outperformed their non-paying public counterparts over the long run. One data set in this report was particularly telling.\n\nIn a collaboration with Ned Davis Research, Hartford Funds showed that companies paying a regular dividend to their shareholders more than doubled the annual average return of non-payers over a span of 50 years (1973-2023): 9.17% versus 4.27%. What's more, dividend stocks were 6% less volatile than the benchmark S&P 500, while the non-payers were, on average, 18% more volatile.\n\nAlthough dividend stocks have a lengthy track record of outperformance, no two income stocks are created equally. In some situations, a plunging share price can pump up a company's yield and lure income seekers into a trap. But this isn't always the case.\n\nWhat follows are two beaten-down ultra-high-yield dividend stocks, with an average yield of 9.69%, which are begging to be bought in June.\n\nTime to pounce: Annaly Capital Management (13.2% yield)\n\nThe first supercharged dividend stock that's been absolutely beaten to a pulp over the last decade -- shares are down 58% on a trailing-10-year basis -- but makes for a delectable buy for income seekers right now is mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) Annaly Capital Management(NYSE: NLY). Annaly has returned $25 billion to its shareholders since its initial public offering in October 1997 and is currently yielding a jaw-dropping 13.2%. NLY Dividend Yield Chart\n\nThere's probably not an industry that's been more universally disliked by Wall Street analysts for longer than mortgage REITs. The simple explanation behind this skepticism has to do with interest rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nMortgage REITs are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates, as well as the magnitude by which monetary policy is implemented. This is an industry that traditionally favors rate-easing cycles and transparent monetary policy changes from the nation's central bank. But since March 2022, it's an industry that's dealt with the fastest rate-hiking cycle in four decades, as well as the longest Treasury yield-curve inversion of the modern era -- i.e., short-term Treasury bills have higher yields than Treasury bonds set to mature in 10 or 30 years.\n\nWhile there's no denying that hawkish monetary policy, which has rapidly increased short-term borrowing rates, is negatively impacting Annaly's net interest margin and the book value of its assets, an argument can be made that the tide is turning in its favor.\n\nTo begin with, we've reached a point where the Federal Reserve has begun slow-stepping its moves. Even in a rising-rate environment, Annaly can be successful. It simply needs telegraphed moves from the Fed to position its asset portfolio for success. If the Fed remains in a holding pattern on interest rates, or better yet kicks off a slow-stepped rate-easing cycle, Annaly should enjoy a modest expansion of its net interest margin.\n\nTo add to this point, the Treasury yield curve has historically spent the majority of its time sloped up and to the right. This is to say that longer-dated bonds have supported higher yields than shorter-maturing Treasury bills. The longer your money is tied up, the higher the yield should be. When this current inversion ends, Annaly's net interest margin and book value can benefit.\n\nIf there's a bright side to the central bank's hawkish monetary policy, is that it's stopped buying mortgage-backed securities (MBS). With the Fed out of the picture as a buyer, Annaly and its peers have had a clearer path to purchase what are now higher-yielding MBSs.\n\nAnother reason income seekers can confidently pounce on Annaly Capital Management is the composition of its $73.5 billion investment portfolio. The company closed out March with $64.7 billion in liquid agency assets. \"Agency\" securities are backed by the federal government in the event of default. While this added protection reduces the yield Annaly receives, relative to non-agency assets, it also allows the company to safely lever its portfolio to maximize its profits. This is how it's able to maintain a double-digit yield.\n\nWith multiple variables pointing to long-term net interest margin and book value expansion, Annaly Capital Management looks like the perfect bad-news buy for dividend investors in June. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTime to pounce: Walgreens Boots Alliance (6.17% yield)\n\nThe second beaten-down ultra-high-yield dividend stock that's begging to be bought by opportunistic income seekers in June is none other than pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA). Shares of Walgreens have retraced by 83% since hitting an all-time high in 2015, with the company's yield recently jumping up to north of 6%.\n\nThough it's not a comprehensive list, Walgreens has been battered by a plethora of headwinds that include:\n\nGrowing competition from online pharmacies. Litigation concerning its role in the opioid crisis. Increased shrinkage (theft) in a few major cities where the company operates. A high level of debt, which isn't ideal in a rising-rate environment. Nearly halving its dividend in January to increase its cash flow.\n\nWhile retail turnaround stories don't occur overnight, Walgreens has the leadership and necessary tools to deliver for its patient shareholders.\n\nAs I've pointed out in the past, the single most-important change that Walgreens recently undertook was replacing Rosalind Brewer with Tim Wentworth as its new CEO.\n\nUnlike Brewer, who had a retail background, Wentworth has decades of experience in the healthcare sector. In particular, he was previously the CEO of Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy-benefits management company in the country, as well as the founding CEO of Evernorth, Cigna's health services organization. Having someone with a healthcare background is critical to Walgreens Boots Alliance's long-term success.\n\nWall Street also seems to be ignoring the fact that Walgreens has levers it can pull to reduce its expenses and positively impact margins as it works its way through short-term challenges. In addition to reducing its dividend to a sustainable level, the company is targeting $4.1 billion in aggregate annual cost savings.\n\nFurther, it's been selling off non-core assets and investment positions, presumably with the intent to lower its outstanding debt and increase its financial flexibility. Selling off its Boots unit in the U.K. might also be on the table as a debt-reduction tactic.\n\nAlthough it's been a bumpy transition, Walgreens Boots Alliance has turned its attention to healthcare services. Despite a recent writedown of its investment in VillageMD, management remains focused on providing full-service health clinics co-located in its stores. Providing differentiation with these full-service clinics, all while keeping expenses under control, could yield profitable results from healthcare services by as soon as next year.\n\nDon't overlook the company's digitization efforts, either. Even though cost-cutting is a key turnaround strategy, management hasn't been afraid to spend on technology in an effort to revamp the company's supply chain, or to build out its direct-to-consumer website to boost organic sales.\n\nLast but not least, the valuation is as compelling as it's ever been. A forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 5, coupled with Walgreens Boots Alliance trading at book value, marks an incredible deal for income seekers willing to exercise patience.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Annaly Capital Management right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Annaly Capital Management, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Annaly Capital Management wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "A crisis is hitting your local drugstore. Why the slow demise of a 130-year-old family-owned pharmacy chain spells disaster for consumers",
        "content": "Sometimes Seattle earns its gloomy reputation. It was cold, dark, and wet on the February morning I arrived, and I needed a new umbrella.\n\nThis should have been a temporary inconvenience, at worst. Seattle\u2014home base to Amazon, Microsoft, Costco, Starbucks\u2014is one of our nation\u2019s most important commercial hubs, and one of its wealthiest cities. Surely there would be several drugstores downtown, eager to sell me new rain gear.\n\nBut many of the stores I walked past were long closed, or filled with shelves that alternated between empty and locked-up. Finally I came to the darkened entrance of what was, until December, store No.\u00a01 of Bartell Drugs, a beloved local chain now owned by Rite Aid. One of the windows still had the Bartell\u2019s logo and a sign declaring it was \u201cEst.\u00a01890\u201d; taped above them was a \u201cFor Lease\u201d poster. Signs on the door told customers their prescriptions had been transferred to the Walgreens up the street. Huddled under a dirty white blanket, a person slept in the entryway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d says Ryan Oftebro, an owner of Kelley-Ross, one of the last remaining general-purpose pharmacies in downtown Seattle. \u201cBartell\u2019s was community-focused and local, and that\u2019s where you went for high-quality service.\u201d\n\nBartell\u2019s, as everybody calls it in Seattle, was passed down from father to son to grandchildren over 130 years before the Bartell family sold it to Rite Aid in 2020. By then, the business had 67 locations, annual revenues of $550\u00a0million, and the title of the country\u2019s oldest family-owned pharmacy. Even today, walking into one of the roughly 40 remaining Bartell\u2019s feels like entering a time portal to the days of soda fountains and the neighborhood pharmacist who knew your kids\u2019 names and the dates of their last colds: friendly clerks, folksy signs, aisles full of toys and chocolates. \u201cBartell\u2019s has always been more than a drugstore,\u201d one of manycolumnists lamenting its fate recently wrote. \u201cIt is part of the fabric of Seattle.\u201d\n\nAnd now it\u2019s dying. Rite Aid declared bankruptcy in October, and since then it has said it will close more than 520 stores. The casualties include a third of the Bartell Drugs locations in the region, one of which was the last 24-hour pharmacy operated by any company in downtown Seattle: Today, anyone who wakes up in the middle of the night seeking cold medicine, or help for a child with an ear infection, has to go to an emergency room or drive to another neighborhood.\n\nAcross the state, the rate of annual pharmacy closures has doubled since 2022. Since 2008, an average of 30 pharmacies per year shut down, according to the Seattle Times. But over a period of 13 months ending in early March, 81\u2014more than 8% of all Washington pharmacies\u2014have gone out of business, according to the Washington State Pharmacy Association.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s a microcosm of a crisis that extends far beyond the Pacific Northwest. American drugstores are caught in a perfect storm of factors: The wide-ranging retail apocalypse has made it more difficult than ever for brick-and-mortar businesses, with their expensive rents and staffing costs and post-pandemic fears about retail crime, to compete with Amazon and other low-overhead online sellers. For pharmacies in particular, the grim shadow of the opioid crisis has saddled the large chains with lawsuits and multibillion-dollar settlements, while overworked and burned-out pharmacists are fleeing the industry in droves. Meanwhile, they say the health insurance companies that decide how much pharmacies actually get paid have been tightening the screws, inexorably reducing their reimbursements for prescriptions.\n\n\u201cPharmacies are in shambles. It\u2019s unbelievable what\u2019s happening right now,\u201d says Abdikadir Athur, a pharmacist who spent six years at Bartell\u2019s and then Rite Aid before cofounding a small pharmacy, Tukwila Station, in the Seattle suburb of SeaTac.\n\nHe adds: \u201cIf even big chains cannot survive\u2014and even CVS and Walgreens are hurting\u2014what do you expect for the small pharmacies?\u201d\n\nIndeed, the big drugstore chains are suffering\u2014at least when it comes to the pharmacy services at the core of their companies. CVS and Walgreens are making less money on an annual basis from filling prescriptions, and are betting on otherbusinesses for growth. Rite\u00a0Aid, trying to claw its way out of debt, is getting out of every drugstore lease it can.\n\nCVS, Walgreens, and Rite\u00a0Aid have announced the closures of more than 1,500 stores. (CVS says its closures of 900 stores over three years were partially to reduce overlap, while Walgreens is closing 200 U.S. stores as a cost-cutting measure; spokespeople for both companies say the vast majority of Americans will still live within five to 10 miles of one of their stores. A Rite Aid spokesperson said that the company is closing underperforming stores \u201cto further reduce rent expense and strengthen overall financial performance.\u201d)\n\nThose closures are contributing to a larger, industrywide decline. In 2023 there were about 4,550 fewer pharmacies than a decade earlier, according to the National Community Pharmacists Association\u2014and industry analysts say those numbers don\u2019t reflect the true impact on smaller and independent pharmacies. The trade group also warned in February that several thousand more local pharmacies, up to a third of its members, could close this year. And that was before the massive Change Healthcare hack snarled insurance reimbursements, upending many pharmacies\u2019 cash flow. (See our story, \u201cAmerica\u2019s health system is still in crisis after its biggest cyberattack ever\u2014but the \u2018catastrophe\u2019 is just a blip for the giant company that got hacked,\u201d also from this issue.) After 15 years at Bartell\u2019s in Seattle, Jacqueline Eide and two partners bought a small pharmacy in Goldendale, Wash., population 3,400.\n\nIndependent providers blame the powerful pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) owned by large health care companies\u2014including CVS and UnitedHealth Group\u2014for squeezing the amount they get paid and making it difficult to turn a profit. \u201cThere\u2019s always been downward pressure on reimbursements,\u201d says Oftebro. \u201cBut the tipping point has really been in the last year or two.\u201d\n\nThe gathering tsunami of pharmacy shutdowns highlights a worsening national crisis for the United States, where health care is the most expensive in the world. As U.S. health care companies continue getting bigger and more consolidated, while the number of primary care doctors shrinks, pharmacies could have filled in some of the gaps. Instead, they\u2019re becoming dystopian nightmares\u2014or vanishing entirely.\n\nPharmacists across the nation, especially at the big chains, are walking out and raising alarms about understaffing and increased workloads, which they say could harm patients. Many have dropped out of the industry altogether: Some pharmacists who have fled retail tell Fortune that \u201cit\u2019s not a desirable profession anymore.\u201d And fewer and fewer people are entering the field: Only 13,323 new pharmacists graduated in 2022, down from 14,223 a year earlier and the largest drop in new graduates since 1983, according to the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. (Spokespeople for CVS and Walgreens tell Fortune that they are listening to their pharmacists\u2019 concerns and investing in addressing them, including by increasing staffing and recruiting.)\n\nIn other corners of retail, e-commerce has filled in the gaps left by brick-and-mortar declines. But for pharmacies, the high-tech solutions\u2014including direct-to-consumer pharmacies such as Capsule, GoodRx, and Mark Cuban\u2019s Cost Plus Drugs\u2014haven\u2019t yet been widely embraced. In 2023, mail-order pharmacies delivered less than 9% of U.S. 30-day prescriptions, according to the Drug Channels Institute.\n\nUltimately, this harms all consumers\u2014with those who are already most underserved and vulnerable paying the biggest price. As Seattle\u2019s drugstore ecosystem shuts down, \u201cit\u2019s creating pharmacy deserts that shouldn\u2019t exist in urban places,\u201d says Ryan Hansen, a pharmacist and professor serving as interim chair of the University of Washington\u2019s pharmacy department.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got Amazon,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have pharmacy.\u201d Ahmed Ali (left) and Abdikadir Athur at Tukwila Station Pharmacy in Tukwila, Wash.\n\nFor a brief, shining moment, COVID-19 seemed like it would revitalize American pharmacies as the fix to our most pressing health care problems. COVID testing and then the government-subsidized vaccine push gave the CEOs of CVS and Walgreens a national platform to promote their pivots toward buying up primary care providers and other doctors\u2019 offices.\n\nThe pandemic initially had a halo effect on all pharmacies, including local chains and independents. COVID testing and treatment was a visible model of how pharmacists could become more effective frontline health care practitioners, delivering accessible, convenient, and affordable care for simple ailments\u2014harking back to the old days of the American corner drugstore.\n\n\u201cWe were very happy in the COVID pandemic, when we had 60,000 pharmacies willing to provide vaccines,\u201d says Inma Hernandez, a professor of clinical pharmacy at UC San Diego. \u201cAnd we know that there\u2019s a lot more to pharmacy access than just getting a drug\u2014it\u2019s about interactions with the pharmacist.\u201d\n\nIn theory, Bartell\u2019s and its Washington competitors should have been well-positioned to reshape primary care for their communities. State law in Washington empowers pharmacists to prescribe, without always referring patients to a doctor\u2014meaning that it\u2019s one of a handful of states where pharmacies could most easily supplement an overtaxed and shrinking primary care system.\n\n\"If even big chains cannot survive \u2026 what do you expect for the small pharmacies?\"\n\nAbdikadir Athur, co-owner, Tukwila Station Pharmacy\n\nInstead, they found themselves fighting for survival. There are many causes behind the national crisis of retail pharmacies, all of which are particularly acute in downtown Seattle. Behind a futile umbrella hunt, a whole retail kingdom is being lost: The pandemic hollowed out urban centers, as wealthier residents fled for greener remote-work pastures. High-end retailers have followed the money, closing down what they see as undesirable locations, while mass-market drugstore chains have responded to fears about theft and other crime by locking up the toothpaste and deodorant. Those changes drive away more customers and hurt the pharmacies that rely on front-of-store retail operations for up to 40% of their revenues. \u201cWhen retailers lock up their products to create plexiglass prisons, they lock out their customers,\u201d retail analyst Brittain Ladd says.\n\nBut the main problem that pharmacists cite is simple: They\u2019re no longer getting paid enough to stay in business. In the multifront battle to cut costs in America\u2019s expensive health care system, pharmacies say they are shouldering a disproportionate share of the burden.\n\n\u201cThat traditional model of that corner drugstore that is just dispensing prescriptions is very difficult, if not impossible, to make work these days,\u201d says Oftebro, adding that at his pharmacies, \u201creimbursement on the majority of prescriptions is now at or below the acquisition cost of the drugs.\u201d\n\nFor this, many blame the middlemen: the pharmacy benefit managers. The three largest PBMs are owned by or affiliated with insurance companies\u2014CVS\u2019s Caremark (which shares a corporate parent with Aetna), UnitedHealth\u2019s Optum\u00a0Rx, and Cigna\u2019s Express Scripts\u2014and together they control how 80% of all U.S. prescriptions are processed.\n\nThe PBMs\u2019 power is part of a bigger story of consolidation. As Fortunereported last year, the relentless M&A and \u201cvertical integration\u201d that have now made CVS and UnitedHealth Group two of the largest companies in the world have concentrated tremendous economic power in the hands of a small number of players.\n\nPBMs say they are able to ease the sometimes-soaring prices set by drug companies. They determine how much patients pay for the medications they\u2019re prescribed and also decide how much they will reimburse pharmacies for buying the drugs\u2014and such reimbursements have been falling for years, pharmacists, executives, and industry analysts note.\n\nPharmacies in general make money on the margins of the prescriptions they fill, as well as by offering additional clinical services and by selling over-the-counter meds and household necessities, greeting cards, cosmetics, and candy. But the margins on prescriptions have gotten so thin that sometimes there\u2019s no money to be made at all, says an independent Seattle-area pharmacist, who offers this illustration: A common brand-name diabetes drug costs around $590 for the pharmacy to buy. The patient pays $75 at the counter, but their insurance plan only covers an additional $480\u2014meaning that the pharmacy is out $35 for filling this prescription. (Adding to the cash squeeze, the pharmacy may also have to wait weeks for the PBM reimbursement.)\n\nThe contracts that determine this pricing are complex, and pharmacists have complained for decades about their lack of transparency, amid their diminishing profits. They also say they don\u2019t have any bargaining power with PBMs\u2019 contracts: If they don\u2019t want to accept the drug prices set by a PBM, they must stop accepting that insurance, meaning they will lose the business\u2014and the ability to serve\u2014the patients covered by that insurance company.\n\nIn areas left with only one or two pharmacies, if a pharmacy refuses to accept the insurance that covers a majority of residents, it can be hard for patients to get their medications locally. \u201cI have clients who have gone a week without their [opioid-addiction treatment] Suboxone,\u201d says Meredith Trible, a job-assistance case manager who works with communities in rural eastern Virginia. \u201cAnd for a lot of rural residents, some of us can\u2019t get delivery all the way to our doors, because of the remoteness of our addresses.\u201d\n\nPBMs and their representatives say, essentially, that pharmacists are crying wolf. PBMs tell Fortune that independent pharmacies do indeed have bargaining power with PBMs, since they generally belong to large pharmacy services administrative organizations that negotiate prices and reimbursements with PBMs on behalf of their members. They argue that independent pharmacists have long made PBMs a convenient scapegoat for all of their business challenges (such as the high costs for small businesses of competing with larger, better-funded chains or low-overhead mail-order alternatives). And they say that PBMs are only negotiating drug prices to save American consumers from the high costs set by Big Pharma manufacturers.\n\n\u201cAccusations that PBMs are forcing pharmacy store closures are unproductive and not based in fact,\u201d Greg Lopes, a spokesperson for PBM lobbyist PCMA, said via an emailed statement. \u201cPharmacy benefit companies recognize the vital role pharmacies play nationwide to create access to prescription drugs for patients.\u201d\n\nYet it\u2019s hard to deny the mountingnational\u2014and bipartisan\u2014consternation over the impact of PBMs on pharmacies and their patients.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned about what\u2019s happened in our state, and I definitely think that PBMs have played a role in the closure of some independent pharmacies,\u201d Sen. Maria Cantwell, the Washington Democrat who has cosponsored legislation that would regulate PBMs with Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, tells Fortune.\n\n\u201cThe situation is now very urgent,\u201d she adds. \u201cWhen you take a pharmacy out of a neighborhood, and they no longer have that in their community, it\u2019s a real problem.\u201d\n\nCVS, which says there is a \u201cstrict firewall\u201d between its pharmacy business and its PBM, Caremark, is navigating both sides of this contentious debate. Its spokespeople tell Fortune that it reimburses independent pharmacies more than it does chains, including its own pharmacies. (The company has also acknowledged in regulatory filings that \"continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure\" has affected the business results of its pharmacy operations.)\n\nMore broadly, and perhaps in light of the mounting attention from Washington, CVS and several other big players dominating health care\u2014on both the retailer and the PBM side\u2014are trying to address some of the issues pharmacists have raised about the PBM model. CVS has recently launched two programs\u2014one for how it gets paid as a pharmacy, and one for how its Caremark reimburses pharmacies\u2014that it says will increase transparency and simplify costs. UnitedHealth\u2019s Optum unveiled a similar program in 2023, and a spokesperson says it is \u201cfocused on ensuring pharmacies are paid fairly.\u201d Cigna\u2019s Express Scripts in November also announced a new, simplified payment model, and a spokesperson tells Fortune the PBM is \u201ccommitted to supporting\u201d the \u201cvital role\u201d independent pharmacies play in health care.\n\nWalgreens\u2019 relatively new CEO, Tim Wentworth, previously ran Express Scripts and has added his voice to the mounting chorus calling for his old industry to change the way it deals with his new one, telling investors in March that Walgreens \u201cwelcome[s] any model that reimburses us for the unmatched value we provide patients.\u201d\n\nStill, independent pharmacists without the scale or heft of Walgreens and CVS aren\u2019t holding their breath for a big change. Oftebro, whose father bought Kelley-Ross in 1973, now runs it and two other pharmacies with partners including the University of Washington\u2019s Ryan Hansen. But these days, he says, it\u2019s their specialist operations that pay the bills because they don\u2019t have to deal with PBMs. These include a cash-only compounding pharmacy; a travel clinic; and specialist services for patients seeking treatment for addiction or HIV prevention.\n\nAs Bartell\u2019s and other downtown pharmacies shut down, and their customers stream into Kelley-Ross seeking basic and unprofitable prescriptions that take time for his staff to fill, Oftebro says he\u2019s been tempted to close down his general-purpose storefront. \u201cWe\u2019re busier than ever, but there\u2019s no margin,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are the same prescriptions that close pharmacies.\u201d\n\nWhen pharmacies lose money and spend staff time on filling high-volume but unprofitable prescriptions, Oftebro adds, \u201ccustomers can love you to death.\u201d\n\nIn 1890 a 21-year-old Kansas pharmacist named George H. Bartell purchased a small pharmacy in central Seattle. Over the next 130 years, as he and his descendants built up a beloved retail hub, the Bartells beat the odds: Family businesses proverbially die within three generations, and small businesses, on average, don\u2019t last a decade.\n\nBut by 2020, Bartell\u2019s was struggling. Its front-of-store business was facing increased competition from online retailers, while its pharmacies were trying to survive on smaller and smaller PBM reimbursements. By the time Rite\u00a0Aid came calling, even though their company was making over half-a-billion dollars in annual revenue, the Bartell family could only get the price up to $95\u00a0million\u2014along with a promise that Rite Aid would keep the Bartell name on its stores.\n\n\u201cWe felt that this was the only answer,\u201d George D. Bartell, grandson of the founder, told the Seattle Times. \u201cIt was getting more difficult for regional operators to compete in the market.\u201d\n\nAlmost four years later, the chain\u2019s employees and customers are still reeling. Those close to the Bartell family, who declined repeated interview requests, talk about the Rite Aid sale like the death of a loved one: \u201cI don\u2019t go into Bartell\u2019s anymore. It\u2019s really hard,\u201d says Billy Chow, Bartell\u2019s former vice president of pharmacy and now head of operations for health care tech startup Prescryptive Health. Chart shows the change in number of pharmacies since 2013\n\nMeanwhile, the chain\u2019s purchaser was facing its own struggles: In October 2020, Rite Aid was running a distinct third to CVS and Walgreens. It had been shrinking for years, especially after a failed effort to merge with Walgreens, and was carrying a load of debt. As state attorneys general started suing pharmacy chains over their pharmacists\u2019 role in the national opioid crisis, Rite Aid eventually faced some 1,600 federal, state, and private suits, and had less of a financial cushion than its bigger rivals. Then-CEO Heyward Donigan was trying to bring Rite Aid back to its pharmacist-centric roots\u2014and Bartell\u2019s seemed like a cheap solution. \u201cWho we want to be, more and more, is your local neighborhood pharmacy,\u201d she told the Seattle Times when the deal was announced.\n\nLess than three years later, in January 2023, Donigan stepped down. By October of that year, Rite Aid couldn\u2019t keep up with its losses and filed for Chapter\u00a011 bankruptcy protection to \u201csignificantly reduce the company\u2019s debt\u201d while helping to \u201cresolve litigation claims in an equitable manner,\u201d the company said at the time. (Rite Aid, now led by bankruptcy-restructuring specialist Jeffrey Stein, declined to make executives available for an interview.)\n\nWhile Rite Aid\u2019s bankruptcy is particularly dire among the big chain drugstores, its bigger and more successful rivals are also facing some struggles. (CVS and Walgreens shares are down about 16% and 48%, respectively, over the past year.) \u201cThis is not a happy industry in retail,\u201d says Neil Saunders, a retail analyst for GlobalData.\n\nThe loss of drugstores means more than just pharmacy deserts. For many low-income and underserved communities, drugstores also serve as groceries and hubs for other necessities. And their closures \u201ccan mean that they\u2019re losing what is essentially their access point to a lot of goods and services,\u201d the University of Washington\u2019s Hansen points out.\n\nBut wealthier neighborhoods are also seeing some fallout. In Seattle, I met Billy Chow for lunch in the lakeside suburb of Kirkland. He had just been taking calls from some of his former colleagues at Bartell\u2019s who were expecting to lose their jobs: \u201cRite Aid\u2019s doing another RIF,\u201d Chow told me, using the corporate shorthand for \u201creduction in force,\u201d or layoffs.\n\nAfter lunch, Chow walked me past one of the newest and shortest-lived Bartell\u2019s, which he had worked on opening right before the Rite Aid sale. The location seemed ideal, down the street from a large Google campus and all of the high-paid tech employees who would make attractive customers. Yet now the building facade was blank, the windows empty, any evidence of Chow\u2019s work erased. Its closure was a quiet collapse, and a dispiriting end to his 10 years at Bartell\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt was a beautiful fabric,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you take one small piece of it and pull\u2014and it all unravels.\u201d\n\nAt the end of my week visiting the fresh graves\u00a0of Seattle\u2019s pharmacies,\u00a0I finally found a new umbrella. On my way out of town,\u00a0I stopped at the still-open and well-stocked Bartell\u2019s in Bellevue,\u00a0the suburb where Jeff Bezos originally founded Amazon. Then I drove five hours southeast to meet another Bartell\u2019s refugee\u2014one who offered\u00a0a glimmer of hope.\n\nAfter a gorgeous drive past Washington\u2019s waterfalls and over its snowcapped mountains, through the Yakama Native American Reservation, I wound up on Main Street in the big-sky town of Goldendale, population 3,450. In 2021, Jacqueline Eide, a pharmacist who spent 15 years at Bartell\u2019s (eventually becoming director of retail operations) fled Seattle to buy the town\u2019s 50-year-old corner drugstore, which she renamed Goldendale Pharmacy.\n\n1,500+\n\nCVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid's announced store closures.\n\nUnder its airy brick arches, Eide and her staff sell chocolates and greeting cards along with all the medicines needed by the local extended community of ranchers and farmers.\n\nSince buying Goldendale with two partners, Eide has treated a growing stream of strep throats and animal bites. (\u201cOne of the things that you learn in a rural area is that barn cats are not as friendly as you think they are,\u201d she says.)\n\nBut while Eide says her business is \u201cstable,\u201d she hasn\u2019t been able to fully escape the industry\u2019s PBM pressures. In January she made a decision that cost her about a third of her business\u2014and forced about 200 of her customers to find another pharmacy: Eide decided not to accept the new insurance those patients had been moved to with the new year, because she would have lost money filling its prescriptions under its PBM\u2019s pricing. \u201cThey were reimbursing below my cost, on average,\u201d she says.\n\nNow, Eide says, some of those former patients must fill their prescriptions at the local hospital\u2019s pharmacy, while others have to drive 35 miles to the big chains across the Columbia River and the Oregon state line. And the patients who have tried to fill their prescriptions through their PBM\u2019s preferred mail-order pharmacy have found that it isn\u2019t always a workable solution in remote rural areas. In Goldendale, for example, the mail is routed through Portland, a city 115 miles away. \u201cWe had two feet of snow in January, and mail wasn\u2019t getting through,\u201d Eide recalls.\n\nStill, Eide says she\u2019s optimistic about the future of her small pharmacy, and has plans to eventually buy a few more. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to get too big,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I want to see pharmacists be able to do more to ease the burden on the whole health care team.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a little bit of hope for an industry\u2014and a state, and a nation\u2014that desperately needs some. As Eide says, \u201cEverybody knows we\u2019re broken.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in the June/July 2024 issue of Fortune with the headline \"The death of the American pharmacy.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "These 3 Dividend Stocks Slashed Their Payouts by More Than 40% Within the Past Year",
        "content": "Dividend stocks can generate plenty of recurring income for your portfolio every year. But investors should always remember that these payouts are never guaranteed. A company facing trouble with its finances might have to resort to cutting the dividend if it can't find a better option.\n\nThe market is full of examples of companies slashing their payouts for a myriad of (good and bad) reasons. Three companies that had to cut their dividend payments by more than 40% in the past year are  Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), Medical Properties Trust (NYSE: MPW), and Cracker Barrel Old Country Store(NASDAQ: CBRL).\n\nLet's look at why they did it and whether these three stocks could now potentially be good contrarian investments.\n\n1. Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nPharmacy retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance has struggled with profitability for multiple years. The company typically generates modest single-digit percentage profits in most quarters, but it isn't uncommon for the business to land in the red, too. In three of its past four quarters, Walgreens posted a net loss.\n\nIn January, the company announced it would reduce its quarterly dividend payout from $0.48 per share to just $0.25 (a 48% cut). It was a seismic move for a company that had been paying and increasing its dividend for decades. The move came not long after the company hired a new CEO, Tim Wentworth. One reason for the cut was to bolster finances needed to continue its plans to launch hundreds of clinics as part of a broad healthcare strategy.\n\nInvestors can still collect a high 6.3% yield from Walgreens stock, but without stronger financials, even the new dividend might not be sustainable in the long run. Walgreens is also actively trying to sell its Boots pharmacy chain in the U.K. to raise additional funds, but it isn't getting much buyer interest.\n\nWalgreens shares haven't been this cheap in more than a decade, so it could be an intriguing investment for contrarians. But with an uncertain path forward, this is a stock that investors will want to keep on a tight leash as losses could continue to pile up for both the company and its shareholders.\n\n2. Medical Properties Trust\n\nMedical Properties Trust has endured problems with financially troubled tenants for multiple years. Steward Health in particular has been a big concern for the healthcare-focused real estate investment trust (REIT). It needs its tenants to pay rent, and Steward and a few other healthcare companies have been struggling to do just that.\n\nMedical Properties Trust even provided Steward with financial support over the years, but that hasn't resolved the tenant's problems; in May, Steward announced it was filing for bankruptcy protection and that it would be selling its hospitals.\n\nStory continues\n\nWell before that, in August 2023, the REIT announced a new quarterly per-share dividend of $0.15, down from the $0.29 it was previously paying (a 48% cut). Given the uncertainty around the future of Steward Health, there's still ample risk relating to Medical Properties Trust and its dividend.\n\nAs with Walgreens, the healthcare stock hasn't traded at its current levels in more than a decade so there could be significant upside for contrarian investors, but there might be significant losses to come as well. Investors should buy the stock at their own risk as the REIT still likely faces a bumpy road ahead.\n\n3. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store\n\nCracker Barrel operates 660 locations across the country with a restaurant and gift shop. It offers multiple reasons for customers to visit one of its stores, but lately, that hasn't been proving to be enough. So the company is investing in its operations to help grow profitability because traffic levels haven't been particularly strong.\n\nIt is going to innovate its menu and remodel stores, and it has hired an agency to help strengthen its brand. All these things, however, require cash, and the company is going to free up the money by slashing its per-share dividend from $1.30 per quarter down to just $0.25, for a massive 81% reduction in the payout.\n\nProfits have been lean for Cracker Barrel, with the company reporting a profit margin of just 2.9% in its last fiscal year (which ended in July), and a challenging economy is exacerbating its struggles. Trading at 10 times its future earnings and with the stock trading at levels it hasn't been at since 2011, Cracker Barrel looks cheap. But it certainly comes with plenty of risk.\n\nIf the restaurant chain's efforts to revitalize its stores pay off, this could be yet another turnaround play with significant upside potential. However, due to the high risk involved, Cracker Barrel is a stock that will be primarily suitable for contrarian investors who are willing to be patient. It could be a while before the company's moves pay off -- assuming they do at all.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Not all dividend stocks are good, and you should always keep an eye out for dividend stocks to sell if they don\u2019t perform well. Dividend payments from publicly traded companies reached a record $164.3 billion in this year\u2019s first quarter, up 7% from a year ago. Data from the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index shows that many U.S. companies are returning excess cash to shareholders. Blue-chip companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) have raised their quarterly dividends. Other companies, such as Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), have paid special one-time dividends.\n\nStill, other companies, such as Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS), have reinstated their dividend after suspending it during the pandemic. Some companies, such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), have paid their first dividend ever this year. While distributions to stockholders seem to be popular, not every company is joining the party. Some companies have dramatically reduced their dividend or stopped paying one altogether, drawing the ire of investors.\n\nHere are dividend duds: three dividend stocks to sell before they drain your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDividend Stocks to Sell: Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (CBRL) The logo for Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc (CBRL) is displayed on a restaurant store front.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe only thing U.S. restaurant chain Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (NASDAQ:CBRL) had going for it was a dividend with one of the highest yields on Wall Street at 9.08%. Unfortunately, Cracker Barrel cut its quarterly payout by 80%, sending investors running for the exits and its share price spiraling downwards. The cut has previously reduced the dividend to 25 cents per share from $1.30.\n\nThe company, which operates a chain of restaurants and gift stores, said the dividend payout is being cut to reallocate capital towards overhauling its brand and stores. The company also warned that its upcoming fiscal third- and fourth-quarter results will likely be below expectations due to weak customer traffic. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store provided no guidance. CBRL stock is down 55% in the last 12 months.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nRetail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) also saw its stock take a big hit after the company cut its quarterly dividend payout to shareholders by nearly 50%. Walgreens lowered its dividend to 25 cents a share from 48 cents, a reduction of 48%. The company said the dividend cut strengthened its long-term balance sheet and cash position.\n\nBefore the cut, Walgreens paid a dividend that yielded more than 7%, which made it the highest-paying dividend stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Note: Walgreens was kicked out of the Dow this spring and replaced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The dividend cut also marked the first time in nearly 50 years that Walgreens reduced its distribution to stockholders. WBA stock has fallen 50% in the past 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) cut its dividend by 66% to 12.5 cents per share as it looks to redirect cash into building foundries that will design the microchips and semiconductors it and other companies design. While the dividend cut has hurt shareholders\u2019 returns, there is little evidence that it has helped the company or its pivot to become a chip foundry business.\n\nIntel continues to report disappointing financial results and a poor showing for its foundry operations. For this year\u2019s first quarter, the company announced that Intel Foundry had $4.4 billion in revenue, down 10% from a year earlier. Intel also continues to report forward guidance that is below Wall Street expectations. All the bad news has conspired to hurt INTC stock, which has declined 37% in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in MSFT.

        "title": "Inflation Relief: Which Retail Giants Are Slashing Prices?",
        "content": "The topic of inflation relief is one most consumers can get behind. Inflation has been stickier than many expected, particularly in key categories. Indeed, when we\u2019re talking about essentials such as food and consumer staples, there isn\u2019t much consumers can do. However, a number of companies are seeing this inflationary environment as one that can be beneficial, if there\u2019s room to cut prices.\n\nWe\u2019re now seeing evidence more price cuts are taking hold, as companies look to attract more consumers to shop both online and physically in stores. Generally, the items seeing the most significant price cuts are essentials, frozen goods and other discretionary purchases.\n\nIncreasing prices because of inflation has led to cautious spending from consumers. Many shoppers are now prioritizing needs over wants, setting a tight budget for shopping. This shift has been a challenge for the U.S. economy, which is currently relying heavily on consumer spending.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInflation is still hovering around 3.4% in March, a 0.3% increase from February, as per data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. NerdWallet says from January 2020 to April 2024, consumer price inflation has totaled close to 20%. For those in the lower income brackets, that\u2019s not a good thing.\n\nThat said, let\u2019s dive into where consumers are seeing the most inflation relief, and from which retailers, right now.\n\nWalgreens\n\nReducing over 1,500 items, including toiletries, snacks and toys, Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) is among the top pharmacy retailers that have announced price slashes.\n\nCompetitors like Target (NYSE:TGT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have similarly cut prices. Some items worth looking out for are gummy vitamins and chips now selling for $11.99 and $1.99, respectively.\n\nTracey Brown, Walgreens retail president, said the company decided to support customers under financial strain; hence, the price reductions. After announcing excellent second-quarter sales expectations, WBA lowered its full-year earnings forecast due to a shift in the retail environment.\n\nThe company\u2019s next earnings report is expected in June, but currently, shares are down 40% this year. Walgreens\u2019 recent earnings report showed a 4.5% drop in retail sales and a 4.3% drop in sales year-over-year.\n\nTarget\n\nTarget has rolled out substantial price cuts on approximately 5,000 popular items. Having already slashed prices on 1,500 products, more reductions are in store for the summer, aiming to save consumers millions. Rick Gomez, the executive vice president, emphasized that these cuts, covering essentials such as milk, meat and diapers, reflect Target\u2019s commitment to competitiveness and aiding consumers in managing their budgets.\n\nStory continues\n\nTarget offered lower prices on household essentials, helping consumers save during Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and back-to-school shopping. Examples of these price cuts included Good & Gather frozen chicken breasts and other frozen products. These reductions included Memorial Day discounts to help consumers celebrate the holiday.\n\nThe company reduced prices on national and popular in-house brands like Good & Gather and Everspring in critical departments such as food, household essentials and health products. New prices, marked with red tags, are accessible in-store, online and through the Target app.\n\nExamples include Good & Gather unsalted butter at $3.79 (previously $3.99), Prime Hydration sports drinks at $1.99 (previously $2.19) and Clorox scented wipes at $4.99 (previously $5.79).\n\nAldi\n\nThis summer, Germany-based Aldi cut prices on 250+ items, addressing inflation worries to keep shopping affordable. Dave Rinaldo, Aldi U.S. president, stressed the need for discounts on seasonal essentials like picnic and BBQ items.\n\nAldi announced on May 2 its intention to cut prices, aiming to save customers around $100 million, nearly twice the savings from a similar initiative last year, which amounted to over $60 million.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThese price cuts from retail giants only aim to stimulate spending amidst inflation concerns. Restaurant chains like McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) introduced fixed-price meal deals, while Michaels permanently reduced prices on popular items by up to 40%.\n\nDespite an unexpected uptick in consumer confidence in May, lingering uncertainties remain about the impact of these discounts. Retailer bankruptcies peaked last year, but empty storefronts are quickly filled due to limited retail space availability.\n\nGrocery chains face significant profit challenges due to small shifts in transaction volume and purchase quantity. While price reductions offer relief, they follow a substantial 26.6% price hike since 2019, compared to a mere 1.6% increase over the preceding five years.\n\nConsumers continue to feel inflation\u2019s impact, as most still compare current grocery costs to pre-pandemic levels, leading to \u201cregister shock\u201d at checkout. This trend is expected to persist.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Walgreens Boots Stock Just Hit Its Lowest Level Since 1998. Time to Buy the Dip or Stay Away?",
        "content": "It's been an ugly past year for Walgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA) stock, which is down over 45% in that span. It's been a tough decade, in fact, with the stock plunging over 75% over the past 10 years.\n\nWith the stock now trading where it was in 1998, let's look what has gone wrong for the company and whether investors should consider picking up shares in the stock at these levels.\n\nCompany struggles\n\nOne of the biggest issues facing Walgreens, and the pharmacy industry in general, has been constant reimbursement pressure. The company has consistently talked about this issue since at least the start of 2016.\n\nWithin the prescription drug industry, pharmacies get reimbursed by pharmacy benefit management companies (PBMs) whose job it is to negotiate prices for their health insurance provider customers. The three big PBMs now control about 80% of the market and have been pushing down reimbursement rates.\n\nThe pressure has hit the entire industry, from big pharmacies, such as Walgreens, to smaller independents. In a National Community Pharmacists Association survey, nearly a third of independent pharmacies said they were considering closing their doors this year due to reimbursement pressures. Meanwhile, Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy last fall.\n\nFor its part, Walgreens has tried to expand beyond the pharmacy business to counteract the reimbursement pressure it has been seeing. However, this led to a poor acquisition on its part, as former CEO Rosalind Brewer set out to create a more integrated company that would treat patients throughout their care continuum.\n\nWalgreens' big mistake was buying a large stake in VillageMD, which itself was acquiring various medical groups to expand. However, expanding beyond its core markets proved difficult for ViilageMD, and last year the company decided to exit a number of newer markets. During its most recent quarter, Walgreens took a $5.8 billion after-tax goodwill write-down of its VillageMD investment in an admission that it greatly overpaid for the business.\n\nFor a company with $8.8 billion in net debt, not including operating leases, an ill-advised investment was not a good use of cash. The company is now looking to preserve cash and had to cut its dividend nearly in half back in January. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCan the business be turned around?\n\nWhen it comes to reimbursement, ultimately there is only so much blood from a stone that PBMs can squeeze out of pharmacies. The new CEO, Tim Wentworth, comes from the PMB business, where he was previously the CEO of Express Scripts. He is looking to shift reimbursements to a cost-plus model, where the company can benefit when it is able to help slow the inflationary pressures on drug prices on its end. It already uses this type of model in the U.K. with Boots, where pharmacists are able to advise patients and prescribe treatments for seven common health conditions.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the company warned that while PBMs have been open to this type of model, it will take time for the industry to shift toward it.\n\nOn the VillageMD and other healthcare side of the business, the damage has been done with the investment not working out as planned. The write-down is non-cash, so it is more of an admission of its mistake than anything else, and shows the likelihood that the business will not grow as expected. Instead, the company is working to restructure VillageMD's cost structure and shrink its footprint to improve profitability.\n\nFor the quarter, the company's U.S. Healthcare segment was able to flip to positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $17 million and a modest adjusted operating loss of $34 million. At the same time, VillageMD sales were up 20% as it saw same-clinic growth. So, there are, at the very least, signs that the segment will no longer be a drag on the company's results.\n\nTime to buy the stock or stay away?\n\nAt a\u00a0forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 5 and enterprise value (EV)-to-EBITDA ratio of 5, Walgreens stock is inexpensive. The latter metric takes into account its net debt and takes out non-cash items. WBA EV to EBITDA (Forward) Chart\n\nThe path to recovery for the business is possible, but it's not going to happen overnight, and it's not guaranteed. The company carries a lot of debt, but it also has assets it can look to sell to reduce debt if it needs to in the future. U.K. pharmacy Boots is one option, as it has performed well with retail market share growth for 12 straight quarters.\n\nAt this point, Walgreens stock is an option to consider for patient investors with a tolerance for risk.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite\u2018s rally has yet to abate, but there are still Nasdaq stocks to sell. The tech-heavy index has risen over 11% and is likely to edge upwards. Fueling the rally are two dynamics. On the one hand, the core consumer personal expenditures (PCE) index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased only 0.3% on a month-to-month basis, a stark difference from the 0.5% month-over-month increase we witnessed in January. Recent macroeconomic data suggests inflation is cooling.\n\nOn the other hand, demand for artificial intelligence products and technologies remains at a fever high. AI-chip behemoth Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported Q1 financial figures last Thursday and beat Wall Street\u2019s revenue and earnings handedly, indicating the AI craze isn\u2019t just hype. The Nasdaq has broadly benefitted from Nvidia\u2019s consistent earnings beats over the past year, and this time wasn\u2019t different from any others.\n\nOf course, not every Nasdaq-listed stock has enjoyed the rally. Like in every index, there are winners and losers. Not every Nasdaq-listed company is linked to AI. Some are operating in sectors that are facing severe headwinds due to high interest rates as well as general macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three Nasdaq stocks to sell this month before they ruin your returns.\n\nThoughtworks (TWKS) The ThoughtWorks (TWKS) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nDigital transformation is an important theme amongst technology businesses these days. Enterprises covering almost every sector of the economy have worked to increase operational efficiencies through onboarding various technological solutions. To help them plan and execute on this pivotal business changes, many companies will approach a technology consultancy services business like Thoughtworks (NASDAQ:TWKS). Thoughtworks helps businesses to develop and implement modernization strategies. For example, the tech consultancy company helped Australian software giant Atlassian (NYSE:TEAM) to migrate its application-building tool, Bitbucket, to the public cloud.\n\nUnfortunately, the uncertain macroeconomic environment has bitten into Thoughtworks\u2019 sales growth since the pandemic years ushered in an era of high interest rates. Uncertainty has caused some of Thoughtworks current clients and prospective ones to delay projects. Moreover, despite a clear earnings-beat for Q1 2024, investors are still feeling sour about the ability for technology services company to improve revenue growth rates. TWKS shares have plummeted more than 29% on a year-to-date basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nLumentum (LITE) A corporate office for the technology company Lumentum during the daytime.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nLumentum (NASDAQ:LITE) is a communications equipment provider that specializes in optical and photonic products. The former is crucial for creating high-capacity, low-latency fiber optics cables, while the latter consists of industrial lasers that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) leverage in their manufacturing processes.\n\nTelecom and data center providers, driven by the rise of cloud computing, have increased their demand for optical products. Photonics devices, which include LiDAR (light detection and ranging) sensors that go into modern automotives, have also been in high demand. As a result, companies like Lumentum should be seeing a steady rise in sales over time. However, the communications equipment provider reported a year-over-year decrease in revenue in its Q3 2024 earnings report as telecom customers pulled back spending as they continue to digest already elevated inventory levels. It\u2019s remains unclear when that particular segment of Lumentum\u2019s customer set will recover.\n\nIn the meantime, LITE shares have fallen nearly 12% on a YTD basis, making it a prime candidate of Nasdaq stocks to sell.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock. Nasdaq Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is probably best known for its iconic pharmacy and retail outlets that are located across the United States. The Covid-19 global pandemic sent the company into a whirlwind. Lockdowns during the onset of the pandemic meant many customers who would have shopped in store for products had to source them online. Walgreens did, however, benefit from the countrywide Covid-19 vaccination campaign. If we double-click into Walgreens\u2019 reported sales growth for fiscal year 2021, there was sizable jump to 8.6% largely off of the back of vaccinations. With the brunt of the pandemic now behind us, those tailwinds have largely dissipated.\n\nThe company\u2019s earnings history after the pandemic years has also been hit or miss. Most recently, despite exceeding Wall Street\u2019s expectations on both revenue and earnings, Walgreens decided to slash its quarterly dividend nearly in half, from $0.48/share to $0.25/share, ultimately causing the chain drug store\u2019s stock to plunge.\n\nWBA has fallen more than 37% YTD, making it amongst some of the Nasdaq\u2019s underperformers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Women in Clinical Trials: 5 Quotes To Inspire Action",
        "content": "Walgreens hosted a Clinical Trials Day event in the Boston area this week where the emphasis was on women's health in the transformation of clinical trials and healthcare innovation.\n\nOriginally published by Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nBy Elyse Russo\n\nNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / May 24, 2024 / Clinical Trials Day is globally recognized on May 20, and this year, the Walgreens Clinical Trials team decided to celebrate with an event dedicated to women's health. After all, May is National Women's Health Month.\n\n\"Walgreens is taking action to elevate awareness about gender-specific disparities related to health, and the importance and relevance of participation in medical research,\" said Kendal Whitlock, head of digital optimization for Walgreens Clinical Trials.\n\nWhitlock was the organizer of the Walgreens Clinical Trials Day event, which was held earlier this week in the Boston area-a timely location as Walgreens just announced that a new clinical trials center will be opening in the nearby city of Malden.\n\nDoctors, pharmacists, community leaders, advocates, academics, tech companies and pharmaceutical organizations were all represented at the Walgreens Clinical Trials event. The day was kicked off with remarks from local Congressman Jake Auchincloss, and featured keynote speakers and panels. Many of the women who participated in the Clinical Trials Day event made bold statements about the state of women's health and how to support women's inclusion in medical research. Here are just five of their inspirational quotes.\n\n1. \"Let's make some noise.\"\n\nWalgreens Chief Clinical Trials Officer Ramita Tandon shared a Walgreens clinical trials milestone that shows the company's commitment to including women in medical research:\n\n\"As the two-year anniversary of our clinical trials business approaches, we celebrate reaching more than 4 million patients to potentially enroll into trials, and of those, more than 60% have been women. We will continue to make strides to bring trials directly to our communities and continue dialing up the noise on women's health.\"\n\n2. \"Ask and explain.\"\n\nDr. Yvette Cozier is an investigator on the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS) and the BWHS Sarcoidosis Study at the Slone Epidemiology Center, Boston University. During her keynote, Cozier talked about how to best recruit Black women for clinical trials:\n\n\"In my research, I've learned that Black women want to participate in clinical research. You just have to package information so that someone like my grandmother would understand it and do it. If you ask women and explain things to them, they will join clinical trials.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n3. \"Looking back informs how to look forward.\"\n\nDr. Bayo Curry-Winchell, who serves as the medical director of urgent care clinics at Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center in Reno, Nevada, says history should inform healthcare professionals how we can push forward in women's health.\n\n\"True diversity in healthcare goes beyond token representation. Acknowledging our history is essential to equip ourselves with insights needed to address trust and prevent delayed care. Afterall, our past still impacts how we're bringing healthcare to women. The National Institutes of Health reported it takes up to 17 years for new evidence to translate into standard clinical practice, which means we're still using practices studied more than 17 years ago.\"\n\n4. \"Inclusion in the standard of care.\"\n\nEpidemiologist Linda Goler Blount, who is also president and CEO of the Black Women's Health Imperative, wants women to feel confident in knowing they are included in developing the standard of care. \r\n\r\n\"When we say something is evidence based, I want the women I'm talking to to know that the standard of care was created with them in mind and that they were involved in the research.\"\n\n5. \"Healthy women should matter to everyone.\"\n\nDr. Beth Garner, who is Chief Scientific Officer of Ferring Pharmaceuticals US, makes the case for why women's health is a topic everyone should care about.\n\n\"We all know that when women are healthy, everyone is healthy. That's why it's important to include people in clinical trials who look like the people who will be using your product when it's approved. That is why it's so amazing what Walgreens is doing in clinical trials. It's so exciting to bring clinical trials to the people.\"\n\nVisit Walgreens.com to learn more about Walgreens Clinical Trials.\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Walgreens Boots Alliance on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\r\nSpokesperson: Walgreens Boots Alliance\r\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/walgreens-boots-alliance\r\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "DEERFIELD, IL / ACCESSWIRE / May 24, 2024 / Walgreens Boots Alliance:\n\nTeens' entries reveal the topics on their minds the most including mental health, social media and social justice\n\nOriginally published by Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nWalgreens awards high school students and teachers more than $25,000 in prize money in the 15th annual Expressions by Walgreens creative arts contest. Expressions by Walgreens is a free contest that gives teens a platform to creatively engage and share their feelings on any topic they choose. This year, common submission themes were the impact of social media, social justice, and mental health. Youth mental health is one of the US Surgeon General's core priorities with one 2023 survey revealing that 87 percent of young people in the United States had suffered some mental health problem on a regular basis. Clinical psychologists call The Expressions Challenge an \"excellent platform\" that helps adolescents \"face emotions, decrease anxiety and build confidence.\"\n\nThe contest shows a record year in student entries with nearly an 80% increase from last year. Walgreens received close to 9,000 student submissions with entries coming from all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the U. S. Virgin Islands in addition to nearly double the online votes for People's Champs winners. Eligible entries are judged in four categories: visual arts, media arts, spoken word, and creative writing. Walgreens also recognizes and awards educators as Teacher Champions for going above and beyond with their support of students.\n\n\"It warms our hearts that our 15th Anniversary year of Expressions by Walgreens has been such a banner year. All the students who entered shared their voice through the art they created, and that's exactly the intention of Expressions,\" says Alethia Jackson, Senior Vice President of ESG and Chief Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Officer at Walgreens Boots Alliance. \"Our commitment to championing healthier communities is of critical importance to current and future generations. The high school years can often be filled with many pressures and distractions, and self-expression through art can be therapeutic in handling those pressures.

        "title": "Here's Why You Should Retain Walgreens Boots (WBA) For Now",
        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. WBA is well poised to grow in the coming quarters, backed by its recent product launches. The company continues to progress in cost-cutting initiatives. However, weak margins and stiff rivalry do not bode well.\n\nIn the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has dropped 19% compared with a 16.7% fall of the industry and a 17.7% rise of the S&P 500.\n\nThe renowned pharmacy-led health and beauty retail company has a market capitalization of $14.21 billion. The company\u2019s earnings surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in two, delivering a surprise of 10.99%, on average.\n\nLet\u2019s delve deeper.\n\nFactors At Play\n\nProduct Launches: Walgreens is launching a slew of products, which is driving the company\u2019s growth.\n\nIn March 2024, Walgreen's wholly-owned subsidiary \u2014 AllianceRx Walgreens Pharmacy \u2014 is selected as the exclusive distributor of Mycovia Pharmaceuticals\u2019 VIVJOA (oteseconazole). Walgreens specialty pharmacy patients now have exclusive access to 240+ limited distribution drugs, which are available through Walgreens specialty pharmacy.\r\n\r\nIn January 2024, Walgreens launched the NHS PharmacyFirst Service in the U.K., which expands the role of Boots pharmacists throughout England to advise and prescribe for the treatment of seven common health conditions.\n\nLong-Term Growth Model Looks Encouraging: Walgreens\u2019 financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement, including those reflected in the Transformational Cost Management Program and other business optimization initiatives.\n\nThe Transformational Cost Management Program is multi-faceted. It includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the company\u2019s information technology capabilities, which is designed to help it achieve increased cost efficiencies. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company is confident in achieving $1 billion of savings in the fiscal 2024. WBA is also working to improve cash flow by prioritizing projects and capital spending. In the first half of 2024, CapEx was $250 million lower than the prior-year period. Walgreens is on track to deliver a $600-million reduction for the full year and $500 million in working capital benefits in the fiscal 2024.\n\nNew Alliances Look Strategic: The significant element of the company\u2019s growth strategy is partially dependent upon its ability to identify and complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances.\r\n\r\nDuring second-quarter fiscal 2024, Shield sales were up 13% as new health system contracts and the expansion of existing partnerships led to more than 40% increase in the number of patients on service in the reported quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nDownsides\n\nPressure on Margin Continues: In the past few years, the slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots\u2019 margins. Of late, increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering Walgreens\u2019 margin on a significant level. In second-quarter fiscal 2024, the gross margin contracted 124 basis points to 19%.\n\nCompetitive Landscape: Walgreens Boots faces headwinds in the form of increased competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to grab market share from other traditional drugstore retailers, major mass merchants such as Target and Wal-Mart are expanding their pharmacy businesses and enjoying a fair market share. The retail wing of CVS Caremark witnessed a record market share gain following the termination of the Walgreens-Express Scripts contract.\n\nEstimate Trend\n\nIn the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2024 earnings has been constant at $3.23.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $145.98 billion, suggesting a 4.9% rise from the year-ago reported number.\n\nKey Picks\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are Medpace MEDP, ResMed RMD and Encompass Health Corporation EHC.\n\nMedpace, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reported first-quarter 2024 EPS of $3.20, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 30.6%. Revenues of $511 million increased 17.7% from last year\u2019s comparable figure. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nMedpace has an estimated 2024 earnings growth rate of 26.5% compared with the industry\u2019s 12.3%. The company\u2019s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 12.8%.\n\nResMed, sporting a Zacks Rank #1, reported first-quarter 2024 EPS of $2.13, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.9%. Revenues of $1.20 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.9%.\n\nRMD has an estimated fiscal 2024 earnings growth rate of 17.9% compared to the industry\u2019s 15.7%. In each of the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average earnings surprise of 2.8%.\n\nEncompass Health, carrying a Zacks Rank #2, reported first-quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $1.12, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.4%. Net operating revenues of $1.3 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6%.\n\nEHC has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 15.6% compared with the industry\u2019s 11.7% growth.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance sold $400 million worth of shares in drug distributor Cencora back to the company, further lowering its stake to about 12% from about 13%, the companies said on Wednesday.\n\nThe proceeds will be used primarily for debt paydown and general corporate purposes, Walgreens said.\n\nFor the past year, the pharmacy chain has been gradually reducing its stake in the drug distributor.\n\nIn November, Walgreens sold about $674 million worth of shares in Cencora and, prior to that, in August, sold some shares for proceeds of about $1.85 billion.\n\nWalgreens owned about 15% in Cencora as of November last year.\n\nThe sale has no impact to the long-term partnership between the two companies, Walgreens said.\n\nSeparately, Cencora said it is now raising its fiscal 2024 profit forecast to $13.35 to $13.55 per share, up from the previous range of $13.30 to $13.50 per share.\n\n(Reporting by Sneha S K in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "S&amp;P 500 Companies Boost Profit by Stripping More Items From Earnings",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Large US companies are bolstering their adjusted earnings per share by excluding items such as litigation expenses and amortization of intangible assets from their net income, even as regulators scrutinize such practices, a new analysis finds.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nOne Dead After Singapore Air Flight Hit By Severe Turbulence These Flight Routes Suffer the World\u2019s Worst Turbulence \u2018It Felt Like We Had Crashed\u2019: Singapore Air Passenger Describes Turbulence Terror Barclays Managers Warn Some Staff to Prepare for Five Days a Week in Office\n\nThe analysis, compiled by data provider Calcbench Inc. and the University of Suffolk, examined about 260 companies that were randomly chosen from the S&P 500. These companies took combined adjustments worth almost $182 billion in 2023, with an average value of $110 million per item, according to data first seen by Bloomberg.\n\nAverage adjusted net income in 2023 was nearly $3.1 billion per company, lower than the approximately $4 billion in adjusted net income per company in 2022 and consistent with the overall decline in net income under GAAP, or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Calcbench said.\n\nPublic companies have to follow GAAP \u2014 a set of agreed-upon accounting metrics \u2014 when they report their financial results. They can choose to provide non-GAAP measures in addition to that. The Financial Accounting Standards Board plans to ask the public by year-end whether it should define non-GAAP measures, given the inconsistencies that can arise when companies use these alternative accounting metrics.\n\nUS regulators in recent years have become increasingly concerned with companies\u2019 usage of non-GAAP measures, with the Securities and Exchange Commission sending letters to various businesses asking about the rationale for stripping out certain expenses.\n\nCalcbench found that in 2023, companies reported average non-GAAP income that was $698 million or 29% higher than the GAAP-figure, directly translating into an increase in adjusted EPS. That\u2019s less of a boost compared to the prior year. In 2022, non-GAAP net income was higher than GAAP income by an average of $1.095 billion per company.\n\nHowever, the report lists an average of 6.3 reconciling items per company in 2023, compared to an average of 5.9 items the year before. Among the items that companies adjusted net income for in 2023 were amortization of intangible assets (33.3%), impairments (22.6%), stock-based compensation (14.7%), restructuring (11.3%) and litigation (13.5%).\n\n\u201cOne thing to keep in mind is that the average number of adjustments in 2023 was higher than in 2022,\u201d said Pranav Ghai, chief executive officer at Calcbench. \u201cNon-GAAP is here to stay.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAdjustments for Litigation, Amortization\n\nCalcbench lists several adjustments as noteworthy, including a $11.6 billion litigation expense at manufacturer 3M Co., a $9 billion adjustment for amortization of acquired intangible assets at pharmaceutical firm Bristol Myers Squibb Co. and a $7.5 billion adjustment at pharmacy operator Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. for legal and regulatory accruals and settlements.\n\nWalgreens pointed to its most recent quarterly filing, in which it stated that in 2023, the company \u201crecorded charges related to the opioid litigation settlement frameworks and certain other legal matters.\u201d 3M, meanwhile, said it does not consider the litigation charge to be a normal operating expense related to its ongoing operations, revenue generating activities, business strategy, industry and regulatory environment.\n\nA representative for BMS didn\u2019t provide comment.\n\n\u201cThe reported findings continue to question the informative value of as-reported GAAP net income,\u201d Calcbench said. There were two large impairments in 2022 by AT&T Inc. and Fidelity National Information Services Inc. totaling $41 billion that didn\u2019t recur in 2023, resulting in a lower amount that year, according to Ghai.\n\nMost, or 86% of examined companies, adjusted income upwards in 2023, meaning non-GAAP income was higher than GAAP income, whereas 14% adjusted it down.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of \u2018Trump Forever\u2019 Google\u2019s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth How the $17 Desk Salad Won Millennium Covets Citadel-Size Commodities Gains, Just Not the Risk Netflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "title": "Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this largest U.S. drugstore chain have returned -0.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.8% change. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, to which Walgreens belongs, has lost 12.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Walgreens is expected to post earnings of $0.68 per share, indicating a change of -32% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.23 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -18.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.13 indicates a change of -3.1% from what Walgreens is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Walgreens is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for WBA _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Walgreens, the consensus sales estimate of $36.02 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.7%. The $145.98 billion and $151.45 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5% and +3.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nWalgreens reported revenues of $37.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.3%. EPS of $1.20 for the same period compares with $1.16 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.22 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.29%. The EPS surprise was +46.34%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Walgreens surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nWalgreens is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walgreens. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Dow at 40,000: Why stocks still have 'plenty of room to run'",
        "content": "Investors are catching the bull by the horns.\n\nThat\u2019s the sentiment gripping Wall Street, as stocks notch record highs and the market is on track for its best month of the year.\n\nA late surge in the final stretch of trading pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJIA) to close above 40,000 for the first time ever Friday \u2014 a milestone that comes just 874 trading days after the Dow first closed above 30,000.\n\nThe blue-chip index added 1.2% for the week, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) both recorded their longest weekly winning streaks since February.\n\n\u201cPsychologically it's amusing,\u201d JPMorgan Asset Management\u2019s Jack Manley said of the milestone on Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u2018Morning Brief.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe rally feels good because the macro data has been pretty good,\u201d he said.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS), Microsoft (MSFT), and UnitedHealth (UNH) were the top three point contributors to the Dow\u2019s charge from 30,000 to 40,000.\n\nAnd the makeup of the Dow looks different than it did during previous milestones. The index most recently replaced Walgreens (WBA) with Amazon (AMZN), bringing it to its current composition.\n\nThis week\u2019s softer inflation print helped bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates before year end, as more investors place their bets on a soft-landing.\n\nIn a note to clients this week, Truist co-chief investment strategist Keith Lerner wrote the recent rally is a \u201chealthy sign and typical characteristic of a bull market,\u201d suggesting \u201cupside potential remains.\u201d\n\nAnd Lerner is not alone. Top Wall Street strategists tell Yahoo Finance that the run is far from over, although the ride ahead may be bumpy for investors.\n\n\u201cThe screens are green and the skies are blue \u2026 there's more upside,\u201d BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance. \u201cBut that doesn't mean that stocks are going to be linear forever. We are going to see some sort of a normal correction and that's a better buying opportunity.\u201d\n\nBelski warns that a more significant pullback than the 5.5% drawdown earlier this year is likely \u2014 before bouncing back to a higher base. He raised his 2024 year-end forecast to a Street high of 5,600; the S&P 500 closed just above 5,300 this week.\n\n\u201cThe fourth quarter in particular, especially post-election, will do very well,\u201d Belski added.\n\nA growing list of strategists have raised their S&P year-end targets. As it stands today, more than half of the strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance have year-end targets at or above 5,300.\n\nManley sees the market gaining another 5% to 10% from current levels, as long as \u201cthe economy is doing well\u201d and earnings \u201ccatch up.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cBig tech names have really been pulling their weight but we need the rest of the index to start playing ball too,\u201d Manley said. \u201cThat\u2019s a back-half story, and I think it helps to lift the market just a bit higher.\u201d\n\nStrong earnings are a key part of the Street\u2019s bullish narrative. As of Friday afternoon, the S&P 500 is on track for earnings growth of 5.7%, the highest earnings growth rate since Q2 2022, according to FactSet. Looking ahead, analysts expect year-over-year earnings growth rates of 9.2% for the current quarter, and 11.1% for fiscal 2024.\n\nNewton Investment Management chief investment officer John Porter told Yahoo Finance he expects the breadth of the earnings improvement to continue beyond big tech, leading to a broadening rally.\n\nOf the 30 best performing stocks on earnings this season, only five came from the tech sector, according to data compiled by Bespoke Investment.\n\n\u201cThe resiliency of the market in the face of much more modest rate cut expectations is very impressive,\u201d Porter said of the 2024 rally. \u201cAs long as the market continues to feel the next move from the Fed is a rate cut, I think you've got good support for the broad market.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s up for debate how much higher stocks can go from here, Carson Group\u2019s Ryan Detrick wrote in a post on X that based on historical analysis, stocks were up 20% on average each time in the year after the Dow hit 10,000, 20,000 and 30,000.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Are you famous enough for picking great stocks to become a billionaire money manager? If not, then there's a lot you could learn from the handful of folks who have.\n\nIt's easier than ever for individuals to invest alongside the professionals. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission makes anyone with more than $100 million under management report their activity to the public every three months. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe latest round of disclosures recently went live, and it seems dividend-paying healthcare stocks with high yields were on the minds of America's wealthiest fund managers. Here's a look at two dividend stocks that got lots of attention from billionaires lately to see if they could be right for your portfolio.\n\n1. Pfizer\n\nShares of Pfizer(NYSE: PFE) are down by about half from a peak the stock set in 2021. In a nutshell, the pharma stock is down because sales of Comirnaty, the company's COVID-19 vaccine, and Paxlovid, its antiviral COVID-19 treatment, evaporated much faster than expected.\n\nPerhaps sensing a bargain, billionaires have been buying Pfizer with both hands. John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments began a new position in the first quarter by acquiring 8.42 million shares. Daniel Sundheim at D1 Capital Partners also made a bold bet on Pfizer by purchasing 7.83 million shares for a new position.\n\nPfizer stock is up from its lowest point during the first quarter, but the pharmaceutical industry giant still offers a juicy 5.8% dividend yield at recent prices. Income-seeking investors will be glad to know the pharmaceutical giant has delivered annual payout raises since 2009.\n\nInvestors can expect Pfizer to announce another dividend raise this December. The company expects adjusted earnings to reach a range between $2.15 and $2.35 per share this year. That's more than it needs to meet the annual dividend commitment currently set at $1.68 per share.\n\nPfizer shares have been trading for the low multiple of about 12.9 times the midpoint of management's earnings expectation for 2024. At this low price, long-term investors can realize market-beating gains even if earnings creep forward at a snail's pace.\n\nIn 2023, Pfizer spent $43 billion acquiring Seagen and its line of cancer therapies. Pfizer will probably report a significant earnings bump in the quarters ahead as it unwinds overlapping operations. Management predicts $4 billion in net cost savings by the end of 2024.\n\nIn addition to lowered expenses, Pfizer's bottom line could benefit from soaring product sales. The company received a record nine new drug approvals from the Food and Drug Administration last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nLower expenses in the near term and new product launches that could drive growth over the next decade make this stock look like a bargain that is appropriate for most income-seeking investors.\n\n2. Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nDecades of consecutive payout raises made Walgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA) one of the most reliable dividend stocks on Wall Street until it slashed its payout earlier this year, from $0.48 to $0.25 per share. The stock has fallen so far that it offers a 5.5% yield at recent prices.\n\nDespite announcing a slashed payout this January, Walgreens attracted several billionaire investors in the first quarter, including the recently deceased Jim Simons. His firm, Renaissance Technologies, opened a new position with 1.83 million shares. Also in the first quarter, Jeff Yass increased Susquehanna's position by 403% to 2.43 million shares.\n\nRetail pharmacy is a low-growth industry at best. With increasing utilization of lower-cost online pharmacies, such as Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs, and profit margin pressure from pharmacy benefits management businesses, investors probably shouldn't expect significant growth from Walgreens' biggest operating segment.\n\nWalgreens' attempt to be more than a pharmacy chain and offer healthcare services has been a disaster. The company invested $5.2 billion in VillageMD in 2021, only to close 160 clinics this year and record a $5.8 billion impairment.\n\nThe retail pharmacy industry doesn't seem like a smart place to put your money. Despite interest from billionaire investors, it's probably best for the rest of us to avoid Walgreens stock until we see evidence that it can execute the vertical integration of a related business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Pfizer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Finding stable investment options is essential for investors looking to grow despite market volatility in today\u2019s unpredictable environment. Three companies emerge as strong contenders for a swift recovery. The first business is growing steadily in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) market, gaining subscribers and broadening its reach internationally. With a strategic expansion into nearly 40 countries and territories and adding millions of new members in a single quarter, the company is almost at the 100 million subscriber milestone.\n\nIn the meantime, the second business is maintaining its position as a leader in the coffee market using its substantial brand equity and cutting-edge product offerings. Despite the industry\u2019s difficulties, the company has a large client base, and cold beverages account for a sizable percentage of its sales.\u00a0This\u00a0suggests continued customer involvement and market relevance.\n\nLastly, the third company has achieved a solid financial milestone in its U.S. healthcare division, as seen by its positive adjusted EBITDA. The company demonstrates resilience and the potential for additional growth in the healthcare sector combined with the growth demonstrated by\u00a0major\u00a0participants in its healthcare services portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) A close-up of the blue and yellow Warner Bros (WBD) sign.\n\nSource: Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) is expanding its subscriber base, adding two million new users in Q1 2024.\u00a0This\u00a0brings its entire D2C subscriber base very close to 100 million. The company\u2019s D2C footprint grew from one U.S. market to 39 nations and territories, with plans to expand into over 25 more European regions and LatAm shortly.\n\nAdditionally, the company has approximately $90 million in positive EBITDA for Q1 despite absorbing\u00a0launch expenses in LatAm.\u00a0This\u00a0indicates the profitability and growth potential of its D2C sector. Moreover, Warner Bros. Discovery increased the average revenue per user (ARPU), with an 8% year-over-year (YoY) growth in the U.S. market and 4% globally. They combined improved subscriber migration experiences, targeted marketing efforts, and content offers. Similarly, churn rates are still higher than long-term goals, but they are declining, having hit a record low in the U.S. at the end of Q1.\n\nFinally, contributing elements include increased content lineups, improved content variety, and user experience. Lastly, the goal of introducing packaged products with Disney+ (NYSE:DIS) and Hulu is to reduce attrition further and boost retention, boosting customer lifetime values.\n\nStory continues\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) continues to have an attached global customer base.\u00a0This\u00a0is an unparalleled lead in the coffee industry and solid and robust international brand equity. The company\u2019s brand is strong despite difficulties in Q2 fiscal 2024 because of its distinctive customer experience and emphasis on coffee craft. The company leads the coffee industry, with 63% of beverage sales being cold, delivering\u00a0great\u00a0performance driven by innovation.\n\nFurther, Starbucks has demonstrated its unique capacity to build storefronts by\u00a0adding 364 net new locations during Q2, increasing its total number of locations to 38,951 worldwide. The company\u2019s strong store expansion strategy is demonstrated by its capacity to plan and construct more than 3,000 new shops a year while focusing on financial assertiveness.\n\nMoreover, Starbucks is a leader in consumer interaction and digital innovation, and its Starbucks Rewards program is a\u00a0key\u00a0factor in generating value. Nearly 33 million Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. as of Q2 represent a 6% YoY increase in membership. Finally, 31% of all transactions during the quarter were Mobile Order & Pay (MOP) transactions, demonstrating the effectiveness and uptake of digital efforts.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe pharmacy services segment of Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) had sharp top-line growth, which improved the business\u2019s overall performance. In Q2 2024, sales in the U.S. healthcare business reached $2.2 billion, a 33% increase over Q2 2023.\n\nAdditionally, eleven micro-fulfillment sites run by Walgreens Boots Alliance sustain more than half its footprint. These centers improve customer service and maximize operational efficiency. Thus, improved NPS ratings, patient retention, and adherence are indicators of these institutions\u2019 increased efficiency.\n\nFurther, in the U.S. healthcare sector, Walgreens Boots Alliance had its first-ever positive adjusted EBITDA quarter. This demonstrates the segment\u2019s financial stability and development potential and represents a major advancement. VillageMD, a significant component in Walgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s healthcare services portfolio, showed development despite obstacles. Pro forma sales of\u00a0$1.6 billion increased by 20% YoY, indicating a solid market position and room to grow.\n\nLastly, the international segment of Walgreens Boots Alliance continuously increased income. For instance, overall sales at Boots UK increased by 3%, while wholesale sales in Germany increased by 5.3%. Therefore, this steady performance demonstrates the segment\u2019s resilience and room for growth.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in WBD, SBUX and WBA.

        "title": "Is Now the Time to Buy 3 of the S&amp;P 500's Worst-Performing Stocks?",
        "content": "The S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is home to some of the best and most promising stocks you can own on the markets. When stocks in this broad index go on sale, it could be a prime time for investors to consider investing in them. Three S&P 500 stocks that have been crashing this year are attracting the notice of bargain hunters: Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), Boeing (NYSE: BA), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).\n\nLet's take a look at why these three S&P 500 stocks are struggling and whether you should consider adding them to your portfolio today.\n\n1. Walgreens Boots Alliance: Down nearly 31% year-to-date\n\nPharmacy retailer Walgreens hasn't been a bad investment for just this year; over the past five years, the stock has lost two-thirds of its value. There are plenty of reasons to be bearish on the stock. Not only has it struggled to grow, but the company's razor-thin margins make it difficult to turn a profit. While it has been diversifying into healthcare with the launch of primary care clinics through its investment in VillageMD, that may only put greater strain on the business and its resources in the future.\n\nEarlier this year, the company slashed its dividend in an effort to strengthen its financial position. The company is also rumored to be looking at selling off assets, including its Boots U.K. pharmacies.\n\nIn the trailing 12 months, the healthcare company has incurred an operating loss of more than $2 billion. And with plenty of challenges ahead, this is a stock that I would steer clear of as things can still get much worse for Walgreens, and there's no guarantee they will get better.\n\n2. Boeing: Down nearly 31% year-to-date\n\nBoeing has had a nearly identical decline to Walgreens this year. The reasons for its struggles also go back multiple years. Its planes have been plagued with safety concerns. In 2019, the Boeing 737 Max was temporarily grounded after it was involved in multiple fatal crashes, and there were reports of issues with engines, wiring, and the flight control computer. Earlier this year, the company made headlines again after a door flew off during a flight. It was later discovered that bolts meant to hold the door in place were missing.\n\nThe big issue with the company is trust. Trust that it can deliver quality planes which airlines and passengers can rely on. Changes are coming to the management with CEO Dave Calhoun stepping down this year. If the company makes significant improvements to its quality control, then there's hope that the business may regain the trust of all its stakeholders, including investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the meantime, the business's financials are underwhelming, to say the least. In three of the past four quarters, Boeing has incurred an operating loss. Revenue for the first three months of 2024 declined by 8% to $16.6 billion.\n\nThe company faces a tough road ahead, and with a potential slowdown in travel demand amid a recession, there are plenty of reasons why things could still get worse for Boeing. Investors may be better off taking a wait-and-see approach with the stock as the risk surrounding Boeing makes it a bit too risky to invest in the business just yet.\n\n3. Intel: Down 38% year-to-date\n\nThe S&P 500's worst-performing stock thus far is Intel, as shares of the chipmaker are down 38% this year. The tech company is positioning itself as a big player in next-gen chipmaking, but that isn't enough to win over investors. CEO Pat Gelsinger says, \"We are one of two, maybe three, companies in the world that can continue to enable next-generation chip technologies.\"\n\nThe problem is that generating those chips may not be easy, despite what should be strong long-run demand. For the period ending March 30, Intel's foundry revenue declined by 10% year over year to $4.4 billion. And that area of its business also incurred a loss of $2.5 billion.\n\nInvestors appear to doubt the tech company's ability to be a serious player in next-gen chips, given its underwhelming financials. But of the three stocks listed here, Intel may be the more intriguing contrarian play due to the need for the U.S. to reduce its dependence on foreign chipmakers. The U.S. government has agreed to give Intel up to $8.5 billion in grants to help increase chip production in the country, plus another $11 billion in loans.\n\nAlthough Intel faces an uphill battle and it's still a risky buy right now, it could make for a good contrarian pick given the support it has from the government and the need for domestic chipmaking capabilities.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn\u2019t one of them.

The product is currently available online and will be chainwide in all stores by the end of the month, where it can be found in the pain aisle, providing a critical point of access for the nearly 10 million customers and patients the company serves every day in local communities throughout the U.S.\n\nWalgreens Brand Naloxone HCl Nasal Spray can be used in the event of an opioid overdose to temporarily reverse the effects of opioids \u2013 including heroin, illicit fentanyl, and prescription opioid medications\u2014when administered in time.\n\n\"As a leading healthcare services company rooted in a retail pharmacy footprint, Walgreens is committed to removing barriers to naloxone access,\" said Dr. Priya Mammen, senior medical director in the Walgreens Office of Clinical Integrity. \"As an emergency physician, I have for years combatted the devastating impacts of the opioid overdose epidemic and worked tirelessly to save lives. Expanding access to naloxone is a critical step in empowering individuals, families, and communities to act and be part of the solution. We must all confront this crisis head-on to bring change.\"\n\nNaloxone works by quickly blocking the effects of opioids on the brain, restoring normal breathing and preventing death due to overdose. Despite its proven efficacy, access to naloxone remains limited in many communities, exacerbating the toll of the opioid epidemic. Walgreens is offering naloxone at a lower price than the comparable national brand product at Walgreens stores to further enable access to this life-saving medication.\n\nThis launch follows the approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

        "content": "Blue-chip stocks to sell might seem odd, especially in a year with rising corporate earnings, a U.S. presidential election and possibly three rate cuts. However, stock investors must stay watchful, especially with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average up 10% and 4.7%, respectively, far from a bull run.\n\nJ.P. Morgan analysts expect poor global growth, inflation and geopolitical concerns to hurt the stock market this year. Analysts think a worldwide recession is possible, but high interest rates and geopolitical upheavals make them skeptical of riskier ventures.\n\nElections in 2024 make things even less assured. This year started better than most election years, which could imply better things throughout the year, but you will never know which way the stock markets will react to the election, which is why looking for blue-chip stocks to sell is important.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is up against tough competition in the tech industry, especially when it comes to cloud services and AI systems. Sales went up just 1.47% in Q1 2024, less than the average 10% growth managed by competitors.\n\nEven though the company is trying to change its business plan, its legacy IT services segment is still hurting its overall performance, leading to sluggish capital appreciation of around 30%. For context, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed Friday at around $898, a 210% one-year gain.\n\nTo streamline its business operations, IBM laid off many people in its marketing and communications departments earlier this year, saving the company $3 billion a year by the end of 2024.\n\nArvind Krishna, CEO of IBM, is now focusing on upskilling workers with the latest AI-focused skills. IBM will replace over 8,000 roles as it starts to scale operations through automation and digital intelligence.\n\nKrishna is notable for acknowledging the fact that IBM, though entering the AI race early lost its way a bit. In an interview with CNBC, he said, \u201cI think that\u2019s a fair criticism, that we were slow to monetize and slow to make really consumable the learnings from Watson winning Jeopardy.\u201d\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) xom insider buying\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxon Mobil\u2018s (NYSE:XOM) earnings fell across all of its business groups in the first quarter of 2024 due to lower industry refining margins and unfavorable timing effects, especially from derivative mark-to-market impacts, which contributed to this decline.\n\nAnother recent issue is Exxon\u2019s dropping its lawsuit against Santa Barbara County for not obtaining permission to carry oil from offshore installations. According to environmental groups, moving crude oil through sensitive areas could cause oil spills and traffic accidents. Apart from the ecological damage, substantial legal losses can also occur.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother concern is that ExxonMobil intends to search for oil and gas in Guyana and Venezuela\u2019s claimed South American shoreline. Because both countries claim the land, the proposal has raised geopolitical and natural concerns.\n\nFinally, ExxonMobil and other oil firms are also criticized for global carbon emissions. Countries like Guyana, where ExxonMobil is active, use their forests to balance out their emissions while still making oil. As the younger generation becomes more ESG-conscious, such issues can lead to issues for XOM stock in the future.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior.

Blue-chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is down over 35% this year, thanks to narrowing its fiscal year 2024 and slashing its dividend 48%, amid a tough retail environment.\n\nWBA reported a net loss of $67 million in the first quarter, less than the $3.7 billion loss in the same quarter the previous year, but this gain was due to the fact that there wasn\u2019t a big pre-tax charge for opioid-related lawsuits and claims that had changed the numbers from the previous year.\n\nBoots\u2019 retail sales in the UK did really well. Compared to the same quarter last year, pharmacy sales went up 0.8% and retail sales went up 9.8%. Boots.com\u2019s sales went up by 17.5%, which made it stand out. These sales now make up more than 19% of all sales at Boots.\n\nBut in the U.S., the healthcare segment made $1.9 billion in sales, with the VillageMD purchase of Summit Health being the driving factor. In the end, the segment reported an operating loss, which is bad news for Walgreens in a key segment.\n\nThe results come shortly after S&P Global Ratings downgraded Walgreens, saying that recent changes in management, such as the CEO and CFO, put the company\u2019s healthcare business at risk.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "Adversity frequently presents chances for recovery and expansion in the stock market. Following recent market declines, three equities have emerged as strong candidates for recovery. Despite their difficulties, these organizations have core competencies and proactive measures that set them up for substantial recoveries.\n\nThe first one leads the way in the entertainment industry\u2019s revolution, with a phenomenal increase in its direct-to-consumer (DTC) segment. With about 100 million subscribers, the corporation\u2019s streaming services have considerable growth and income creation potential due to their tremendous engagement and market attractiveness.\n\nMeanwhile, based on strategic investments, the second one placed itself as a strong leader in the healthcare industry. Its dedication to developing joint ventures and increasing healthcare delivery assets highlights a proactive market expansion and advancement approach. Finally, its operational efficiency and worldwide market prowess drive the third one\u2019s growth trajectory. The company holds a propensity for long-term value growth and market adaptation through cost-cutting measures and stable performance in international markets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese companies may hit new market valuation highs in coming quarters.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) The logo of the new Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) company on smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased on its performance and strategic moves, Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) appears to hit considerable growth. Its DTC arm expanded rapidly during Q1 2024. The company acquired 2 million new subscribers and is about to hit the $100 million milestone, which\u00a0indicates a solid hold on vital market share.\u00a0Hence, this growth reflects the broad popularity of Warner Bros. Discovery among customers throughout the world while also suggesting elevated demand for its streaming services.\n\nAdditionally, the US average revenue per user (ARPU) grew by 8% year-over-year (YoY) during Q1. Meanwhile, the overall ARPU uplifted\u00a0by 4% YoY, indicating that Warner Bros. Discovery can monetize rapidly on its subscriber base and the efficiency of its content and product upgrades. Hence, the success of its monetization techniques and the value proposition it provides to clients\u00a0is reflected\u00a0in the growth of ARPU, particularly in the U.S.\n\nLastly, with progressive content releases like \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d and \u201cGodzilla x Kong,\u201d Warner Bros. Discovery has derived over $1.2 billion in global box office revenue. Therefore, the leads of these big-budget movies highlight the company\u2019s fundamental capacity to create sharp content that appeals to a wide range of viewers.\n\nStory continues\n\nCVS Health (CVS) The front sign for a CVS Pharmacy, CVS stock\n\nSource: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.com\n\nCVS Health\u2019s (NYSE:CVS) investments in healthcare delivery assets reflect its strategic focus on progressive leads in the industry, including Oak Street Health and Signify Health. Collaborating with third-party discount card administrators for CVS CostVantage agreements represents strategic alliances to expand market presence and spur growth.\n\nMoreover, in Q1 2024, CVS Health produced $4.9 billion in cash flow from operations,\u00a0demonstrating solid cash flow management skills. Completing a $3 billion expedited share buyback deal and paying $840 million in quarterly dividends reflect the company\u2019s focus on deriving value.\n\nFurther, CVS Health has\u00a0demonstrated resilience in the face of obstacles in its Medicare Advantage business by acting quickly to alleviate constraints on utilization and enhance clinical operations. Due to its wide range of assets, CVS Health is well-positioned for expansion. The company emphasizes its pivotal role in guaranteeing a sustainable biosimilar industry, resulting in reduced expenses for clients and increased customer retention and growth.\n\nFinally, proposals like the Humira formulary modification and the launch of CVS CostVantage show how innovative and market-driven CVS Health can be, with the potential for explosive development.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite slower-than-expected market growth, Walgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s (NASDAQ:WBA) pharmacy division held onto its market share. Pharmacy services, volume growth and brand inflation contributed to an 8.7% YoY (Q2 2024) increase in pharmacy comp sales. The pharmaceutical services category saw a robust overall performance, with the vaccines portfolio performing better than anticipated.\n\nAdditionally, Walgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s initiatives improve the role of pharmacists by allowing them to provide some healthcare services outside of prescription dispensing. Towards the bottom line, in the US retail pharmacy division, the company showed strong execution and cost control, resulting in an adjusted\u00a0EPS of $1.20. The business took several cost-cutting measures, such as reorganizing, optimizing the site and enhancing the pharmacy and retail operating models.\n\nMoreover, the international division demonstrated robust and steady performance, with Boots UK recording significant increases in market share and retail comp growth for the twelfth consecutive quarter. The sales from Boots.com account for more than 17% of UK retail sales. Specifically, Boots UK\u00a0reported a 3% YoY rise in consolidated revenues.\n\nTo sum up, the company\u2019s lead in the global market demonstrates its fundamental capacity to adjust to local market conditions and spur expansion.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in WBD, CVS and WBA.

        "title": "Royalty No More: Time to Pounce or Flee From These 3 Stumbling Dividend Aristocrats?",
        "content": "Dividend Aristocrats are a unique class of dividend stocks. They are companies that are members of the S&P 500 and have increased their payouts to shareholders for at least 25 years. That\u2019s no small feat. Out of the thousands of publicly traded stocks on the market, only 68 stocks made the cut this year.\n\nThis elite group of royals are important because dividend growth stocks tend to outperform all other stocks over time. Looking back to 1930, Ned Davis Research found companies that initiated a dividend and then grew the payout beat every other class of stock, whether they paid a dividend or not.\n\nAnd yet, Dividend Aristocrats constantly evolve. Each year, more companies cross over the quarter-century threshold of dividend increases. They are added to the group, while others are forced to drop out because they are either removed from the benchmark index or cut their payouts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three recent dividend royals who cut their payouts and can no longer be considered Aristocrats. Are they better stocks now to buy, or should you run away from them? Let\u2019s find out!\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nIndustrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM) had a 66-year history of raising its payout, but legal liabilities pressured its free cash flow (FCF). With some analysts estimating it could run into the billions of dollars to settle everything, there might be little to nothing left over to support the dividend.\n\nDividend increases were miserly too. Over the past few years, 3M raised the payout by only a few cents at a time. It meant investors were receiving less income because of the ravaging effects of rampant inflation. To return some value to shareholders, 3M recently spun off its healthcare businessSolventum (NYSE:SOLV) into a separately traded company.\n\nHowever, the unit was responsible for 30% of 3M\u2019s cash flows. As that would further pressure the dividend, the conglomerate reset its payout to 40% of adjusted FCF compared to 60% before the spinoff. While that causes it to lose its Dividend Aristocrat status, does it make 3M a better dividend stock to buy now?\n\nOver just about any timeframe, 3M has significantly underperformed the market. Yet the industrial conglomerate is settling its lawsuits, and clarity is beginning to form. Retiring CEO Mike Roman said, \u201cPaying a competitive dividend has been a priority for 3M for more than 100 years. This will continue to be true\u201d after the spinoff.\n\nMMM stock now sits at an attractive valuation, its balance sheet will be in a better position, and it has the potential for earnings growth going forward. This could be the best time in years to buy 3M stock. Still, investors might want to wait for the dust to settle to see if the conglomerate\u2019s business can turn around.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nDrugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) was another Dividend Aristocrat with a long track record of raising its payout. Walgreens had 47 years under its belt before deciding to slash it by 48% in January. The shocking news was needed, though, as the pharmacy suffered in the aftermath of the pandemic.\n\nYet Walgreens has been an even worse performer than 3M. Over the past decade, the pharmacy\u2019s total return was negative 65%, a tremendous destruction of shareholder value. Walgreens sought to shed its U.K.-based Boots pharmacy business and a beauty care products outfit to turn the company around and free up more cash to invest in the industry. When that fell through, it was clear the dividend needed to be cut.\n\nWalgreens is still headed in the wrong direction, and shares are down 33% in 2024. While it may be on track to deliver some $1 billion in cost savings this year, the company has yet to show how that will translate into growth. At this point, Walgreens Boots Alliance remains a dividend stock to avoid.\n\nVF Corp (VFC) Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobal apparel and footwear company VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) lost its Dividend Aristocrat status last year. The owner of such notable brands as The North Face, Timberland, Dickies and Vans also suffered from the pandemic, albeit differently than Walgreens. It took on excess debt when consumers were reining in discretionary spending to survive. That led to a build-up in inventory just as inflation was running rampant.\n\nRemarkably, VF\u2019s 10-year stock performance made Walgreens look good. Its total return for the period was negative 72.5%.\n\nVF slashed its dividend by 41% to conserve cash, reducing the quarterly payout from $0.51 to $0.30. It launched numerous cost-cutting measures, including selling non-core assets while eliminating non-strategic spending. When profits kept plunging, it withdrew its full-year outlook and cut the payout again! This time by 70%, down to $0.9 per share.\n\nThere is no bottom yet for the apparel stock. With management saying \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d at this point, there is no reason for an investor to get near this stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in MMM, SOLV and WBA stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nRich Duprey has written about stocks and investing for the past 20 years.

However, it revived discussions on separating Boots, including the possibility of an initial public offering in London, according to a Bloomberg report late last year.\n\n($1 = 0.7970 pounds)\n\n(Reporting by Mariam Sunny in Bengaluru; Editing by Ravi Prakash Kumar and Pooja Desai)\n\nView comments",

Specialty patients can also view their entire prescription profile at Walgreens, including their retail prescriptions.\n\n\"When a patient must confront a life-changing, serious health challenge and begins therapy for a chronic or complex condition, our pharmacists are right there to guide and care for them throughout their healthcare journey -from helping them order and take their medication to identifying financial assistance opportunities and working with their doctor and insurance plan to make sure they're receiving the most coordinated care,\" Gates said.\n\nIn addition, Walgreens has seen consistent growth through its wholly owned subsidiary Shields Health Solutions, the nation's premier health system-owned specialty pharmacy accelerator. Shields specialty model provides integrated care solutions for local health systems and specialty pharmacy patients, working with over 1,000 hospitals across 45 states.

        "content": "In the latest market close, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) reached $17.23, with a -0.69% movement compared to the previous day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.44%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.18%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the largest U.S. drugstore chain had lost 9.54% over the past month. This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 0.94% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.22% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Walgreens Boots Alliance in its forthcoming earnings report. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $0.68, marking a 32% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year.

        "content": "In a market that is sometimes obsessed with consumer names and high-flying tech companies, lesser-known stocks frequently go unnoticed. But among these many missed chances, three sleeper stocks have the potential to outperform the market and rise above their 52-week lows. These three equities present investors with bright growth possibilities and have quietly made big moves in their respective industries. They prioritize user engagement programs, a testament to their customer-centric approach, smart debt reduction, and robust performance.\n\nThe first company has been assiduously lowering its debt load, consolidating its finances, and clearing the path for upcoming investments and value returns. The second one, with a solid financial base, has shown exceptional user engagement and steady revenue growth in the face of intense competition in e-commerce. Meanwhile, the third one has demonstrated tenacity in its pharmacy services in the face of retail setbacks, suggesting unrealized potential for expansion in healthcare solutions.\n\nOverall, these companies have prospects that go beyond the obvious. Their growth methods and distinctive core qualities enable them to surpass market expectations and yield significant profits.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) The logo of the new Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) company on smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe company\u2019s solid progress in lowering its debt load bolstered Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s (NASDAQ:WBD) potential for rapid expansion. During Q4 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery paid down $5.4 billion in debt, increasing the total debt that has been reduced since the purchase closed to more than $12.4 billion. Its net leverage ratio is 3.9 times EBITDA.\u00a0This\u00a0is a significant decrease from earlier levels. Despite these developments, the company\u2019s primary objective is to continue deleveraging, with a long-term gross leverage target of 2.5 to 3 times EBITDA.\n\nAdditionally, debt reduction improves Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s base flexibility by decreasing the interest load and the risk attached to excessive leverage. Warner Bros. Discovery now has more\u00a0cash($4.3 billion) and manageable debt due over the next three years, increasing its fundamental ability to make sharp acquisitions and investments. All existing debt has fixed rates, averaging 4.6% over the past 15 years. Hence, this fixed-rate arrangement offers security and defense against changes in interest rates.\n\nTo sum up, Warner Bros. Discovery reduces the risk of increasing interest rates by switching from variable-rate to fixed-rate debt.\n\nStory continues\n\nJD (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company.

An even quicker rise in new users demonstrated that user acquisition activities were succeeding. Thanks to an increase in devoted current users\u00a0and\u00a0members, user shopping frequency on JD increased during Q4 and 2023, suggesting increased user stickiness and a greater likelihood of making more purchases. Order volume growth is steady, reaching double digits year over year in Q4 and climbing for three straight quarters. Similarly, user transactions and platform utilization are also rising.\n\nMoreover, net revenues increased\u00a03.7% for 2023 and 4% for Q4 year-over-year (YoY), showing steady revenue growth despite difficulties. Non-GAAP net income climbed dramatically to RMB 35.2 billion in 2023. Operating cash flow was RMB 59.5 billion for 2023 compared to RMB 57.8 billion for 2022. Therefore, healthy cash flow reflects solid financial health and an operational edge.\n\nFinally, the company\u2019s focus on boosting valuation\u00a0is reflected\u00a0in its approval of a new share repurchase program of $3 billion over the next 36 months.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior.

Similarly, sales in the international division climbed by 3.2% YoY, primarily due\u00a0to Boots UK and Germany\u2019s good performance. In the U.S., sales of retail pharmacies increased by 4.7%, while healthcare sales jumped by 33% YoY.\n\nMoreover, despite a 29.5% fall in adjusted operating income in the U.S. retail pharmacy sector, the overseas segment recorded a rise in adjusted operating income (AOI) of 3.2%. On the other hand, the U.S. healthcare business had its first-ever positive adjusted EBITDA quarter, suggesting room for expansion in this domain.\n\nFurther, Walgreens Boots Alliance performed well in pharmacy services despite difficulties in the retail sector. Specifically, Pharmacy services, volume growth, and brand inflation contributed to an\u00a08.7% increase in pharmacy comp sales. With a vital YoY growth trend, the U.S. Healthcare division recorded its first-ever positive adjusted EBITDA quarter. Lastly, Shields, a company in the U.S. healthcare category, saw strong adjusted EBITDA growth compared to the same quarter last year, demonstrating the efficacy of tactics meant to maximize market value.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in WBD, JD and WBA.

As a young girl, I accompanied my mother on a routine trip to Walgreens, unaware that this visit would shape the course of my future.\n\nAs we stood in line at the pharmacy counter, my attention was drawn to the sight of a pharmacist engaged in conversation with a patient. Fascinated by the pharmacist's ability to offer guidance and support, I felt a sense of purpose and possibility.\n\nIn that moment, a seed was planted-an aspiration to make a meaningful difference in people's lives through healthcare. Inspired by what I had witnessed, I began to envision myself in a similar role, dedicated to serving others with compassion and expertise.\n\nToday, I'm 24 years into an amazing career at Walgreens. In 2000, I started as a pharmacist and was soon promoted to pharmacy manager. From there I became a district pharmacy supervisor and ultimately a healthcare supervisor. In this role, I oversee 62 stores and support four district managers in Northwest Houston and surrounding areas. My work days can vary, but typically I spend my time identifying how my stores are helping to improve patient health outcomes and where the opportunities are to close gaps in care. I also visit stores regularly to provide clinical expertise and ensure compliance with federal and state regulations.\n\nWhen I'm not visiting stores, I'm leading meetings with my pharmacy managers to celebrate wins and identify opportunities for improvement. Or I'm participating in regional and corporate-level meetings for strategic planning to bring our organization's purpose to life.\n\nEmpowering women's leadership and wellness\n\nBecoming a member and leader within the Women of WBA (WoWBA) business resource group was driven by my desire to connect with fellow women leaders to find a sense of community; have a direct impact on Walgreens' diversity, equity and inclusion strategy; and enhance my own leadership skills. As the vice chair of WoWBA-US, I'm devoted to fostering inclusion and inspiring women within the organization to own and celebrate their uniqueness and achievements. It's important to challenge yourself to grow and to be the best version of yourself. I'm dedicated to lifelong learning and personal development, and I encourage women of all ages to embrace the power of education. I've truly enjoyed supporting the professional development of the many team members I have worked with over the years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a leader, I am committed to not only championing women's professional growth, but also supporting their health and wellness. With May being Women's Health Month and Mental Health Awareness Month, it's such a fitting time to encourage women to also prioritize their health. As women, we often take on numerous roles in our personal and professional lives, but it's essential that we remember to prioritize our own wellbeing. From reproductive health to mental wellness and beyond, this month serves as a reminder for women to take charge of their health journeys.\n\nI am incredibly proud of the series of events WoWBA-US has planned for this month, which includes a panel discussion focused on work-life balance and decreasing stress, as well as a meditation event and virtual art exhibit. By advocating for regular check-ups, screenings and healthy lifestyle choices, we empower ourselves and others to lead fulfilling and vibrant lives.\n\nMy commitment to women's health extends beyond the workplace. As a mother, I strive to set an example for my daughter, showing her the importance of prioritizing self-care and personal wellbeing.\n\nFun awaits beyond the office\n\nTraveling with my daughter is one of my greatest joys. Each year, we take on a handful of adventures together. Our recent ski trip to Canada was one for the ages. It was such a fun time to relax while playing in the snow. In addition to our love for travel, my daughter and I share a passion for the arts and music. This year, we're anticipating our upcoming trip to Las Vegas to see New Edition in concert.\n\nOur trips are a source of happiness and inspiration for both of us. When I'm fulfilled outside of work, I find that I'm more creative, more motivated and more able to tackle professional challenges. As I lead my team, I carry with me the joy from our mother-daughter adventures. They remind me of the importance of finding harmony in both my personal and professional lives, and how that can positively impact everything I do.\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Walgreens Boots Alliance on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\r\nSpokesperson: Walgreens Boots Alliance\r\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/walgreens-boots-alliance\r\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For many investors, the concept of putting money into healthcare stocks to sell them at a future date might seem like a safe investment. After all, almost every person in the United States is dependent upon the corporatized healthcare system in some way or another.\n\nThe only real exception to this paradigm is the U.S. military and its TRICARE insurance program for all of its servicemembers and their families.\n\nAs such, the common perception in the investment world is that healthcare stocks tend to represent more stable investments that have a higher likelihood of long-term growth and potential dividend yield.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnfortunately, there are several healthcare companies currently struggling to stay afloat. This is due to changes in governmental decisions and a shift in the culture of major U.S. urban centers. From rampant theft, with no real prosecution in sight, to centralization of healthcare services amongst major oligopolies, these three companies represent healthcare stocks to sell in the event of a stock market crash.\n\nClover Health Investments (CLOV) Person holding cellphone with webpage of healthcare company Clover Health Investments Corp on screen with logo Focus on center of phone display. CLOV Stock.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock\n\nA relatively young healthcare corporation, Clover Health Investments (NASDAQ:CLOV) has struggled to capture revenue, according to its last earnings report, with a 44.31% loss of revenue for the quarter down to $506.21 million. The company has struggled to raise the necessary income to achieve profitability.\n\nIts negative profit margin also expanded and its last quarterly earnings report decreased by 50.16% down to a margin of -13.92%. For such a small company, this level of loss could be catastrophic in the event of a market downturn.\n\nMoreover, the company does not provide any critical services or products to consumers, rather, it attempts to streamline the healthcare provision process. It attempts to derive this from its flagship software platform, the Clover Assistant.\n\nThus, despite the company\u2019s admirable goal of providing affordable healthcare through efficient healthcare plans, it does not currently present a stable or reputable investment opportunity.\n\nCVS Health (CVS) the exterior of a CVS pharmacy store\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDrug stores across the U.S. are facing an epidemic of untamable theft, with CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) struggling the most. For whatever political reason, a lot of shoplifting has gone unprosecuted in some cities, specifically acts of theft under a certain threshold.\n\nThis has encouraged criminals to enter drugstores, steal whatever they please under that threshold, and then resell it either online or on a secondary market. At first, CVS and other drug stores attempted to dissuade this theft by locking more valuable items behind transparent display cases, and requiring an associate to come and help shoppers to pick out what they need.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, this short-term solution impacts the shopping experience to the extent that drugstores are no longer attractive to the kind of clientele who spend enough to keep the stores open. Additionally, CVS has struggled financially, closing several stores across the U.S. This has caused its profit margins to dwindle.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nMuch like CVS and many other drug stores, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is facing many of the same issues as its counterparts. However, the company has more to worry about than retail theft, considering the extensively negative coverage it has received due to its massive net losses of $5.9 billion in its last quarterly earnings report.\n\nThis loss is essentially a result of significant impairment charges due to the reduction in goodwill value of VillageMD, a company that WBA had acquired a two-thirds stake back in October 2021. This was initially intended to be an expansion for the company, but has since turned into a nightmare for investors.\n\nNow, Walgreens has been forced to close a number of VillageMD clinics, in an attempt to cut costs and return to the path of profitability. As of right now, the company has posted a loss of $6.85 per share, making it one of the healthcare stocks to sell before the next earnings report.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this largest U.S. drugstore chain have returned -9.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, which Walgreens falls in, has lost 22.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nWalgreens is expected to post earnings of $0.68 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -32%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.2%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.23 points to a change of -18.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.13 indicates a change of -3.1% from what Walgreens is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Walgreens.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for WBA _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Walgreens, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $36.02 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $145.98 billion and $151.45 billion estimates indicate +5% and +3.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nWalgreens reported revenues of $37.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.3%. EPS of $1.20 for the same period compares with $1.16 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.22 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.29%. The EPS surprise was +46.34%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Walgreens surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nWalgreens is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walgreens. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "How to Boost Your Portfolio with Top Retail-Wholesale Stocks Set to Beat Earnings",
        "content": "Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\n\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Walmart (WMT) earns a Zacks Rank #3 nine days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 16, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.53 a share.\n\nWalmart's Earnings ESP sits at 1.65%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.53 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.52.\n\nWMT is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, which is readying to report earnings on June 25, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.70 a share, and WBA is 49 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 2.75% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.68.\n\nWMT and WBA's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "3 Consumer Staples Stocks to Sell in May Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "If you\u2019re wondering which consumer staples stocks to sell this month, look no further. The consumer is hanging tough. Despite persistent inflation and elevated interest rates, Americans are continuing to spend. The Commerce Department recently reported that retail sales in March rose 0.7%. Data for February reflects 0.9% growth, which was the biggest gain in more than a year, and higher than an initial estimate of 0.6%. Economists polled by the Reuters news agency had forecast that April retail sales would increase 0.3%. On a year-over-year (YOY) basis, March retail sales were 4% higher.\n\nWhile the continued spending on everything from clothing and groceries to new vehicles and travel is good news for the economy, the data is starting to show some behavioral changes among people. Businesses report that consumers are seeking out cheaper generic alternatives to their name brand products, and the latest Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) credit card data shows that lower-income spending is outpacing spending by more affluent Americans as the wealthy tighten their purse strings.\n\nShould consumer spending falter in coming months, it would be bad news for the economy and could roil the stock market. Here are three consumer staples stocks to sell in May before they crash and burn.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nConsumer Staples Stocks to Sell: Unilever (UL) The blue Unilever sign next to the desk inside de head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nSource: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.com\n\nBritish consumer goods company Unilever (NYSE:UL) is the company behind consumer products ranging from Dove soap and Axe body spray to Degree deodorant and Vaseline. The company also makes some limited food items such as Hellman\u2019s mayonnaise and Knorr bullion cubes. Unilever and its stock have struggled mightily for many years now with the share price down 14% over the last five years. This has led to the decision to spin-off Unilever\u2019s ice cream unit that includes brands such as Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Magnum.\n\nThe company said that the separation of its ice cream division, arguably its most popular business unit, is part of a broad restructuring that will see the company cut 7,500 jobs and achieve cost savings of more than $850 million. Going forward, Unilever will be restructured into four business units: beauty and wellbeing, personal care, home care, and nutrition. Management says that its ice cream unit, which generated $8.57 billion in revenue in 2023, will perform better as a standalone business. Analysts seem skeptical.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nRetail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s (NASDAQ:WBA) latest earnings report contained some encouraging signs. But the company is by no means out of the woods. This is, after all, a company that was kicked out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the subpar performance of its stock. Year-to-date, WBA stock is down 33%. The company\u2019s share price today is 66% lower than five years ago. Walgreens most recently lowered its profit outlook for the year as it grapples with a \u201cchallenging economy.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWalgreens has struggled with slumping demand for Covid-19 medications, low pharmacy reimbursement rates, and a failed push into healthcare services. New CEO Tim Wentworth has undertaken an aggressive cost reduction program, announcing in January that he was cutting the dividend payment by nearly 50%.The question is: will it be enough to turn Walgreens around. WBA stock was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average earlier this year and replaced by e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) continues to struggle as consumers switch to lower priced generic versions of its products, a move being taken in response to the company raising prices. PG stock recently fell after the company behind Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razor blades reported mixed first-quarter financial results that showed its sales missed Wall Street\u2019s target. Management has said repeatedly that price increases prompted by inflation are pushing consumers to cheaper generic products.\n\nIn its Q1 print, Procter & Gamble announced EPS of $1.52 versus analysts forecasts of $1.41. Revenue totaled $20.2 billion, which was below forecasts of $20.41 billion. Sales were up a slight 1% from a year earlier. The company reported overall flat sales volumes for Q1, while the average prices across its product categories rose 3%. Company executives warn that challenges may persist if inflation remains sticky, requiring continued price hikes.\n\nPG stock is up 5% over the last 12 months, missing out on most of the bull market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks Perfectly Positioned to Weather Market Swings in May",
        "content": "May has historically been a month of market uncertainty on Wall Street, often characterized by the adage \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d While this strategy might not always hold true, it highlights the potential for increased volatility. The prospect of a market correction can be daunting as investors grapple with ongoing geopolitical tensions, sticky inflation levels and interest rate uncertainties. However, periods of heightened choppiness can present valuable opportunities to patient investors with stocks to buy for market volatility.\n\nTherefore, today, we explore three stocks to buy for market volatility. These companies boast proven business models, solid financials and a track record of delivering value to shareholders despite market turbulence. With that in mind, here are three stocks perfectly positioned to weather market swings in May.\n\n3M Company (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nTopping our list of stocks to buy for market volatility is the industrial conglomerate3M (NYSE:MMM). its business segments include Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, Health Care and Consumer. The company is known for its substantial R&D investments and has a history of pioneering new products and technologies.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLast month, 3M released strong financial results for the first quarter. Adjusted sales reached $7.7 billion, reflecting a modest year-over-year (YOY) increase of 0.5%, driven by strength in automotive and electronics businesses. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surged 21% YOY to $2.39.\n\nPreviously, at the start of the second quarter, 3M announced the successful completion of the spin-off of its healthcare business, Solventum (NYSE:SOLV). As a result, 3M received $7.7 billion in cash while retaining 19.9% of the outstanding shares of Solventum common stock. Wall Street expects Solventum to generate more than $8 billion in annual revenues, making it a significant player in the healthcare market.\u00a0Thus, MMM investors will watch SOLV stock\u2019s performance closely as well.\n\n3M Company has appreciated 7% year-to-date (YTD) and currently trades near 1-year highs. Yet, MMM shares still seem attractively priced at 13.2 times forward earnings and 1.65 times sales. Analysts have a 12-month price target of $100 for MMM, suggesting a potential upside of 3% from current levels.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother stock to buy for market volatility is the pharmacy-led health and retail business Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). The company operates a vast network of retail pharmacies under the Walgreens and Boots brands across the U.S., Europe and Latin America.\u00a0In addition, WBA offers a wide range of health and beauty products and convenient healthcare services.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance released strong fiscal 2024 second-quarter results in late March. Total sales for the quarter rose 6.3% YOY to $37.1 billion, reflecting growth across all segments. Adjusted net earnings climbed 3.5% YOY to $1.0 billion, while adjusted EPS increased 3.4% to $1.20.\n\nMeanwhile, management announced the launch of gene and cell services as part of the newly integrated Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy business. The healthcare group is looking to increase its presence in serving patient needs better in emerging therapies. Investors expect the company to provide more healthcare services in stores while beefing up the more lucrative aspects of the pharmacy business.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance has paid a dividend in over 350 consecutive quarters, and the stock currently has a lucrative dividend yield of 5.6%. Yet WBA stock has tumbled more than 30% YTD. The stock trades at a very cheap 5.6 times forward earnings and 0.11 times sales. Wall Street remains bullish, with a median 12-month price target of $22, implying a 24% upside.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, AT&T (NYSE:T) is another top pick among stocks to buy for market volatility. Last month, the telecommunications giant delivered mixed earnings results. Revenues totaled $30.0 billion, a YOY decline of 0.4%, due to lower Mobility equipment revenues. However, adjusted operating income, excluding certain items, remained flat at $6.0 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EPS declined 8.3% YOY to $0.55, reflecting increased depreciation costs.\n\nInvestors noted that AT&T\u2019s subscriber growth blew past analyst expectations, adding 349,000 new postpaid phones and 252,000 fiber\u00a0internet subscribers. Yet, both were lower than the subscriber growth numbers posted a year ago.\n\nIn addition to its core businesses, AT&T continues to innovate and invest in emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity and cloud services. Looking ahead, AT&T is also strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the growth of 5G and fiber networks.\u00a0These strategic initiatives diversify the company\u2019s revenue sources and position it as an important global player in the digital transformation of industries and businesses. Management also highlights its commitment to financial discipline while it works on reducing debt and streamlining operations.\n\nSo far in 2024, T stock has traded flat. The shares currently trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 7.6x and a trailing price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1x, suggesting a relatively cheap valuation. In addition, shares currently have a dividend yield of over 6.5%. Finally, Wall Street remains optimistic, while the 12-month median price forecast for T stock is $20. Such an up move could mean an almost 20% return for buy-and-hold investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "Joint collaborations bring Boehringer Ingelheim's Phase III clinical trial to communities through Walgreens pharmacy clinical trial centers and EmVenio's mobile research units, aimed at improving access to trials\n\nOriginally published by Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nDEERFIELD, IL and RIDGEFIELD, CT / ACCESSWIRE / May 2, 2024 / Walgreens and Boehringer Ingelheim today announced a strategic collaboration aimed at optimizing recruitment and making clinical trials more accessible, inclusive and equitable. This collaboration will offer people an opportunity to learn about and potentially participate in an important Phase III clinical trial within the familiar and accessible environment of Walgreens pharmacies, reflecting a shared vision to expand access to healthcare and research.\n\nThrough this collaboration, Boehringer Ingelheim will leverage select Walgreens community pharmacies as clinical trial sites for people living with obesity, overweight and type 2 diabetes. The effort aims to dismantle barriers, improve access, and address equitable health representation in clinical trials, especially among Black and Hispanic adults who are more likely to have obesity in the U.S. and have historically been underrepresented.\n\n\"Embracing our pharmacy clinical trial centers in this study underscores our joint commitment to community health and innovation,\" said Ramita Tandon, Chief Clinical Trials Officer at Walgreens. \"This model not only provides foundational education on clinical research for patients but also empowers individuals, offering them a new pathway to engage in their healthcare through clinical trial participation.

The company said other Big Pharma contracts have not yet been revealed.\n\nWalgreens currently has 15 trial sites set up in pharmacy locations, of which two, in New Jersey, will be used for the BI trial, according to Walgreens chief clinical trials officer Ramita Tandon.\n\nPatients will be flagged in Walgreens' system based on the drugs they are prescribed, as well as other qualifying factors, based on the trial parameters set by BI, she said.\n\n\"We are then digging into our own ecosystem and reviewing the prescription records, reviewing the social determinants of health information on the patient population, and then matching those patients to this particular phase three trial,\" Tandon said.\n\nThe company continues to build out trial sites based on where pharmaceutical companies are looking for greater access to diverse populations.\n\n\"Bringing clinical trials into these communities is ... a capital efficient way to leverage our ecosystem, our physical assets, our trust, our brand,\" Tandon said.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "content": "Walgreens and Boehringer Ingelheim Are Partnering to Improve Diversity in Clinical Trials\n\nJoint collaborations bring Boehringer Ingelheim\u2019s Phase III clinical trial to communities through Walgreens pharmacy clinical trial centers and EmVenio\u2019s mobile research units, aimed at improving access to trials\n\nDEERFIELD, Ill. & RIDGEFIELD, Conn., May 02, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Walgreens and Boehringer Ingelheim today announced a strategic collaboration aimed at optimizing recruitment and making clinical trials more accessible, inclusive and equitable. This collaboration will offer people an opportunity to learn about and potentially participate in an important Phase III clinical trial within the familiar and accessible environment of Walgreens pharmacies, reflecting a shared vision to expand access to healthcare and research.\n\nThrough this collaboration, Boehringer Ingelheim will leverage select Walgreens community pharmacies as clinical trial sites for people living with obesity, overweight and type 2 diabetes. The effort aims to dismantle barriers, improve access, and address equitable health representation in clinical trials, especially among Black and Hispanic adults who are more likely to have obesity in the U.S. and have historically been underrepresented.\n\n\"Embracing our pharmacy clinical trial centers in this study underscores our joint commitment to community health and innovation,\" said Ramita Tandon, Chief Clinical Trials Officer at Walgreens. \"This model not only provides foundational education on clinical research for patients but also empowers individuals, offering them a new pathway to engage in their healthcare through clinical trial participation.

(NASDAQ:WBA) is facing tumultuous times as it grapples with a challenging turnaround, leading to a drastic decline in its stock value, marking its worst performance in over five years.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares plummeted by 18% in April, nearing a 26-year low, following a downward revision of its outlook.\n\nThis revision was accompanied by concerns over decreased consumer spending and the revelation of a substantial unpaid tax liability amounting to\u00a0$2.7 billion, adding to the woes of the beleaguered drugstore chain.\n\nIn March, Walgreens Boots Alliance reported second-quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings and narrowed the\u00a0fiscal year\u00a02024 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.20-$3.35 versus\u00a0prior guidance of $3.20-$3.50\u00a0and consensus of $3.24.\n\nOver the past eight years, Bloomberg highlighted that Walgreens has witnessed consistent losses in its stock value, primarily due to its struggle with high debt stemming from an aggressive acquisition spree.\n\nDespite this downturn, the company remains optimistic about its prospects, embarking on a strategic review of its operations to regain investor confidence\u00a0and reignite growth.\n\nKey\u00a0management changes, including the departure of former CEO Roz Brewer, have further unsettled investors, with the stock shedding nearly half of its value during her tenure.\n\nThe company is now exploring potential separations, including discussions to split from its\u00a0UK pharmacy chain, Boots, and assessing options for its specialty pharmacy business, Shields Health Solutions.\n\nHowever, Wall Street\u2019s sentiment toward Walgreens remains cautious, with analysts adopting a wait-and-see approach, the Bloomberg report added.\n\nWhile some anticipate positive outcomes from the strategic review, others express concerns about potential asset monetization, fearing the loss of crucial components of the business or selling assets at a discount.\n\nAmidst these challenges, the broader landscape of the pharmaceutical market also faces turbulence, with\u00a0Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) announcing the closure of its primary-care clinics, reflecting the difficulties companies face expanding into the sector.\n\nDespite the prevailing skepticism, citing some analysts, Bloomberg highlights potential avenues for Walgreens to improve its fortunes.\n\nRead Next: Women\u2019s History Month: Pharmacy Chains CVS Health, Walgreens To Start Dispensing Abortion Pill Mifepristone In Select States.\n\nPrice Action: WBA shares are down 1.97% at $17.38\u00a0at the last check Wednesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE (WBA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Investor Optimism Dampens as Walgreens Boots Alliance Struggles With Market Turbulence originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "The U.S. economy is slowing, which is bad news for consumer stocks. In recent days, economic data showed that gross domestic product (GDP) in America grew at an annualized rate of 1.6% in the year\u2019s first quarter, considerably slower than the preceding quarter\u2019s 3.4% growth. At the same time, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 3.4% annualized rate in Q1, up from 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nSlowing U.S. growth and rising inflation has markets worried about stagflation, which occurs when inflation continues to rise even though the economy slows. Fears of stagflation have roiled the stock market in recent days, as have diminished expectations that the Fed will lower interest rates this year. A majority of futures traders now predict no rate cuts in 2024. It all adds up to continued market volatility for investors which is why they should pay attention to this list of consumer stocks to avoid.\n\nWW International (WW) image of a balanced diet\n\nDown 80% over the last year, WW International (NASDAQ:WW), the company behind Weight Watchers, has already crashed. Investors should be cautious about buying the dip in WW stock. The company\u2019s share price is now below $2 because its once popular diet and weight loss program has been usurped by obesity drugs such as Ozempic and Zepbound. Even former Weight Watchers spokesperson Oprah Winfrey has severed ties with the company as she herself switches to using prescription medication for weight loss.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWW stock is trading in penny stock territory, defined as any security that trades for less than $5. The sharp decline comes as consumers flock to new blockbuster weight loss drugs such as Novo Nordisk\u2019s (NYSE:NVO) Ozempic and Eli Lilly\u2019s (NYSE:LLY) Zepbound. Analysts are raising questions about WW International\u2019s ability to remain in business, noting that the company has $1.5 billion of debt.\n\nLast year, Weight Watchers long-time rival Jenny Craig filed for bankruptcy, citing the impact of weight loss drugs. At this time, investors should consider companies that sell weight loss programs and diet plans consumer stocks to avoid. Instead, focus on pharmaceutical companies that are helping people lose weight through medication.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s still not a good time to take a position in retail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). Over the last 12 months, WBA stock has fallen 50%, including a 35% decline so far this year. The company\u2019s share price today is 68% lower than where it was five years ago. The situation has gotten so bad with Walgreens that the stock was removed from the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average earlier this year. The company\u2019s most recent earnings report, where it lowered its profit outlook, hasn\u2019t helped.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo be fair, Walgreens did report fourth-quarter 2023 revenue that beat Wall Street forecasts. However, the company lowered its 2024 profit guidance to $3.20 to $3.35 per share, down from a previous outlook that called for $3.20 to $3.50 in per share earnings. Analysts had expected full-year earnings of $3.24 a share from Walgreens. Management said the reduced guidance reflects an uncertain economic environment and challenging retail sector. The company declined to give a revenue forecast for the year.\n\nLululemon Athletica (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nIt\u2019s not even summer yet, but 2024 has already proven to be a challenging year for Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU). Slowing sales in North America are largely responsible for LULU stock falling 30% since January. The athletic apparel company has responded to the slowdown by announcing that it is closing a distribution center in Washington state and eliminating 128 jobs. The company said it decided to close the distribution center as it re-evaluates its global network.\n\nLULU stock really began to tumble after the company reported disappointing Q4 2023 numbers and issued weak guidance. Lululemon reported that its Q4 sales rose 9% in North America compared to 29% growth a year earlier.\n\nWhile Lululemon is still growing in the U.S. and Canada, its sales have slowed considerably. As for 2024 guidance, Lululemon said that it expects annual sales of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion compared with analyst estimates of $10.9 billion. This makes LULU another one of the well known consumer stocks to avoid.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in LLY.

Riley Securities, Inc.\n\nPresentation\n\nOperator\n\nGood day and welcome to the Franklin BSP Realty Trust first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lindsey Crabbe Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nLindsey Crabbe\n\nGood morning. Thank you check for Hosting our call today. Welcome to the Franklin BSP Realty Trust First Quarter 2024 earnings conference call. As the operator mentioned, I'm on the call with me on the call today are Richard Byrne, Chairman and CEO of FBRT; Jerry Baglien, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of FBRT; and Michael Comparato, President of FBRT.\r\n Before I begin, I want to mention that some of today's comments are forward-looking statements and are based on certain assumptions. Those comments and assumptions are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties as described in our most recently filed SEC periodic reports and actual future results may differ materially. The information conveyed on this call is current only as of the date of this call, April 30th, 2024. The Company assumes no obligation to update any statements made during the call, including any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\r\n Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings release and supplementary slide deck, each of which are available on our website at www.FBRTRE. dot com. We will refer to the supplementary slide deck on today's call.\r\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich.\n\nRichard Byrne\n\nThanks, Lindsay, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As Lindsay mentioned, our earnings release and supplemental deck were published to our website yesterday. We will begin today's call on slide 4, and I'm going to review our first quarter results and then open the call up as always for your questions.\r\n First, we were pleased with our first quarter results. FDRT.'s distributable earnings increased to $0.41 per fully converted share compared to $0.39 in the prior quarter. This equates to a 10.4% distributable earnings return on common equity. Our distributable earnings dividend coverage for the quarter was 115%. Our strong earnings are the result of stable portfolio size throughout most of the quarter, which add to the continued benefit of higher base rates as well as a strong contribution from our conduit business, our conduit as an alternative business line that can be an earnings enhancer. Cmbs CMBS has again become one of the lower-cost financing options in the market. So we remain cautiously optimistic that conduit revenues will continue to benefit our earnings in future quarters.\r\n Our core portfolio ended the quarter at $5.2 billion of principal balance, which is an increase from the core from the last quarter. This was due to very strong originations in Q one. In fact, Q1 was our fourth largest origination quarter since the inception of our company, we added $591 million of new loan commitments in the quarter and committed to $756 million of originations through the entire year to date. As of yesterday, most of our Q1 portfolio growth happened towards the back half of the quarter. So we did not see the full benefit of the larger portfolio in our first quarter net interest margin. We expect to enjoy this positive income impact in future quarters. Multi-family CONTINUED continues to be our main sector, and this represents 75% of our commercial real estate loan portfolio. We closed the quarter with 1 billion in available liquidity, including 240 million of unrestricted cash. Our cash balance decreased by $98 million in the quarter versus Q4 due to our active deployment into new originations. Our strong liquidity position allows us to capitalize on the current abundance of attractive new investment opportunities and provides us flexibility to resolve credit issues the extent they arise.\r\n Turning to our watch list, we ended the quarter with six loans with a risk rating of four on our watch list. Our watch list represents approximately 5% of our core portfolio. As previously disclosed, one asset was removed from our watch list during this quarter taken as REO and then liquidated at a at a modest gain. We have been successful in working through problem loans and achieving positive outcomes. While there will continue to be changes to our watch list each quarter with loans potentially being added and or removed. We are optimistic about our team's ability to continue to manage this process Mike will provide more watchlists detail in his comments, including promising feedback on several assets.\r\n The risk for the risk profile of our portfolio remains low with an average overall risk rating of 2.3 at quarter end, unchanged from the prior quarter and 95% of our loans are risk rated three or better. Our foreclosure REO positions also remains unchanged. Sitting at three at quarter end. Walgreens' retail portfolio continues to make up most of this balance. And as we have said previously, the portfolio has is being actively marketed for sale in aggregate, our foreclosure REO positions represent 2.2% of our total assets.\r\n Lastly, I want to mention that we purchased $1.9 million of FBRT. common stock during the first quarter, we continued to be active in the second quarter and so far we've repurchased an additional 2.1 200,000.0 excuse me, 2.0 million of our common stock through April 19th, 2024. This totals 3.8 million year to date in total, since our program began, the company and its advisor purchased $68 million of FBRT. common stock. Our Company buyback program is authorized through the end of 2024.\r\n Finally, FBRT.'s first quarter was a strong start to 2020 for our distributable earnings, once again, comfortably exceeded our dividend level and we were able to grow our loan portfolio, adding what we would call a new vintage of loans that offers strong credit quality, which will also enhance FBRT.'s earnings power. While we continue to see a challenging environment for commercial real estate, especially as many loans reach initial maturity this year, we are confident in the resilience of our multifamily focused portfolio and our ability to effectively resolve challenging loans.\r\n Now with all that Jerry, I'm going to turn things over to you to cover our financial results.\n\nStory continues\n\nJerome Baglien\n\nThanks, Rich, and I appreciate everyone being on the call today. Moving onto our results, let's start on Slide 5, FPRT. generated GAAP earnings of $35.8 million, or $0.35 per diluted common share. That's an increase of $0.07 from the prior quarter and this earnings on earnings level represents an 8.9% return on common equity. In the first quarter, we earned 41 million in distributable earnings in the first quarter and a walk-through of our distributable earnings to GAAP net income can be found in the earnings release.\r\n Our CECL reserve increased by 2.9 million during the quarter, which includes an asset-specific reserve of 700,000 on one of our watchlist loans. Seasonal increase resulted in a $0.03 per share reduction to GAAP earnings. This also impacted our first quarter book value, which ended the quarter at $15.68 per share.\r\n Slide 7 summarizes our portfolio progression. As Rich said, our core portfolio ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in principal balance new commitments, future funding on existing loans and repayments this quarter resulted in a net increase of $199 million from last quarter. Nine loans were repaid in full. During the quarter, multifamily made up 70% of our repayments with hospitality, self-storage and office contributing to the remaining balance. We expect the pace of repayments to be similar in the coming quarters.\r\n Turning to Slide 8. This provides a high-level snapshot of our capitalization. Our average cost of debt during the quarter was modestly lower at 7.8%. Our liability structure provides us with optionality. A large portion of our portfolio is financed through our CLOs. At quarter end 80%, 87% of our financing on our core book is nonrecourse and non-mark-to-market. The reinvestment period is still available on two of our five CLOs. And despite limited issuance, the CRE CLO market has seen some activity and offerings since our last deal in September. Our current funding position is strong.\r\n However, we will remain opportunistic in accessing the capital markets when necessary in future quarters, we can strategically tap into CLO financing when market conditions are attractive and align with our future funding needs. Our liability structure is further enhanced by our warehouse facilities. We maintain strong relationships with a diverse group of six lenders, each demonstrating a healthy appetite for our loans.\r\n This strong demand underscores the credit quality of our entire portfolio, encompassing both legacy assets and our recent originations, notably our new loans, both some of the highest credit quality we've seen in several years. We maintained a net leverage position of 2.4 times at quarter end. Importantly, we have consistently delivered relatively strong distributable earnings return on our equity without taking what we believe to be a outsized risk.\r\n With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to review give you an update on our portfolio.\n\nMichael Comparato\n\nThanks, Jerry, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us, and I'm going to start on Slide 12. Our core portfolio ended the quarter at $5.2 billion, spread across 145 loans with an average size of 36 million. As you can see, 99% of our loans are senior secured and our exposure is 75% in the multifamily sector. We continue to be long-term bullish on the fundamentals of multifamily. As previously discussed the asset class offers compelling advantages due to its superior credit quality and robust liquidity profile. We're strategically concentrated on the Southeast and Southwest U.S. given the positive macroeconomic trends of the major metros within those geographies. These areas continue to be a focus for new investments.\r\n Slide 13 highlights our origination activity. In the first quarter, we originated 11 loans at a weighted average spread of 464 basis points. While we had several unique transactions this quarter, this spread is indicative of the market opportunity previously mentioned the quality of the deal flow we are seeing is very attractive with strong terms, including higher debt yields and lower loan to values of revalued asset levels. This quarter, we originated loans in the multifamily industrial, hospitality and office sectors. And while we remain extremely bearish on office, the office loan we closed in March was a unique credit opportunity that came with very attractive economics. However, inclusive of this new loan, our off exposure, our office exposure still stands at only 6% across our entire portfolio and excluding our long-term net leased corporate headquarters and distribution facility our office exposure is under 5% of the portfolio. Our conduit program platform had an excellent quarter closing five transactions. Echoing Rich's earlier remarks. We are encouraged by the conduits momentum and in Q1, we securitized $101 million of loans with a weighted average profit margin of 5.5 points. We look to conduit revenue to continue to contribute to earnings in the coming quarter. But this is historically lumpy, lumpy revenue and difficult to model. We believe this is the first quarter in quite some time that we can say that all businesses within FERT. were hitting on all cylinders. That said, we recognize the current market presents challenges with increased borrowing costs and softening asset values. Fortunately, FBRT. benefits from being a part of BSP. is broader real estate platform and can leverage the team, we believe is among the industry's best our asset and senior management teams are actively working with borrowers to develop solutions and address any loan related issues that may arise.\r\n Moving to slide 14, you'll see a summary of our watch list activity. We ended the quarter with six loans on our watch list, all four rated with an aggregate value of $264 million. Last quarter. I provided detailed information on our risk rating process. And I'll remind you today that a rate of four rated asset is one that is an asset with an underperforming business plan with the potential of some interest loss, but still expecting a positive return on investments.\r\n Six loans on our watch list are a CBD high-rise office building in Denver, Colorado. This loan was amended and extended maturity by two years and requires a 2 million principal paydown later in 2024. We have a Class A. suburban office building in Alpharetta, Georgia. This loan was also recently amended to extend maturity by one year. The borrower paid down the loan by approximately $1.4 million in 2023 and paid down an additional $1 million in the first quarter of 2020 for a full-service 279 key hotel in Dallas, Texas.\r\n This property is finalizing its sale process and should pay off at or very close to our outstanding debt balance based on offers received to date, it's a 426 unit apartment property in Cleveland. Ohio is a new add this quarter and we are in active dialogue with the borrower. And the last two watchlist loans are 471 unit apartment community in Raleigh, North Carolina and a two property portfolio of apartment assets in Morrisville and Chapel Hill, North Carolina. We are in the process of foreclosing on these assets. And as of today, we expect to finalize their sale to third parties at or above our basis in the second quarter.\r\n With respect to nonaccruals, we will highlight the four loans. One is a newly built multifamily asset in Las Vegas, where subsequent to quarter end, a mezzanine lender has taken control of the asset and the loan is now current. Another two assets are the two less watch list loans I just discussed. And lastly, we have a cross portfolio of multifamily assets that are also in the process process of being sold. It is important to note that while we place these assets on nonaccrual in Q1, we have been receiving payments and recognize that recognizing them on a cash basis. All in all, I believe we are making good progress through our watchlist loans, and we are hopeful the three remaining nonaccruals will be resolved in the second quarter.\r\n With respect to modifications, in Q1, we closed 17 credit positive loan modifications and negotiated pay-downs on nine loans representing 4.1% of their respective loan balance on on average, our borrowers contributed nearly 30 million of incremental equity related to extensions and modifications in the first quarter.\r\n Moving to slide 15, we had three foreclosure REO positions at quarter end. Those positions or report lists of our Portland office building, which we continue to believe is not the right time to exit the asset, a multifamily asset in Lubbock, Texas, where our asset management team continues to meaningfully improve the asset and increase occupancy. It is still classified as held for investment during But through our improvements and retenanting. And our last REO is our Walgreens portfolio. We hold 23 retail stores as part of this portfolio at quarter end all assets around the market for sale, and we are actively attempting to liquidate the entire portfolio. In aggregate, our foreclosure REO balance ended the quarter $122 million, which is approximately 2.2% of our total assets.\r\n Wrapping up, we are very bullish about the market opportunity for FERT. We have a legacy loan portfolio that will continue to require our focused attention. But at the same time, a combination of factors are leading to compelling new origination opportunities, which we are taking advantage of every new loan we originate improves the overall credit quality of our portfolio, and we will continue to be a market leader on new originations.\r\n With that, I would like to turn the call back to the operator and begin the Q&A session.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Stephen Laws, Raymond James.\n\nStephen Laws\n\nJust to start, Mike, appreciate all the comments on the portfolio. Can you touch on the nonperforming loans and what type of sponsors those are there? Any similarities or multiple loans to the same sponsor. And just generally, you know what you're seeing in multi-family around sponsor stress, especially given kind of this higher for longer rate outlook and decisions that the sponsors are making, whether to protect or walk away from like from assets?\n\nMichael Comparato\n\nSure. Thanks, Stephen, for the question, and thanks for joining this morning. I would say generally we're seeing more stress in the syndicated borrower structure than anything else. The typical GPLP. 95, five, 90 10 syndicated equity, where there's it's less controlled by the underlying sponsor and some of the decisions on capital calls are being made at the LP level. Again, I think we've seen our borrowers generally trying to work things out in a positive way. And I think strangely, one of the strongest positives is we're not even on negative outcomes having many sites, which is really helpful through the workout process. I think that a lot of borrowers. If they have decided the time has come, they are ready, willing and generally able to work with us quickly to resolve things. And we're not ending up in court, which is a positive for everybody.\n\nStephen Laws\n\nGreat. Appreciate the color there. And one quick follow up, but Jerry, you mentioned about the financing facilities and noticed, I think one with Atlas the capacity was was trimmed a bit. Can you talk to that decision and kind of how those discussions are with your financing line providers?\n\nJerome Baglien\n\nI mean, just generally in terms of how the conversations are. I think they've been very positive for us because we're primarily using those facilities to finance the new originations that were closing and space. So in terms of credits that we're putting to the banks today. They're all brand new lease prices as clean as you're going to get in some of the best credits we've seen in a long time. So all that's well received in terms of sizing, some of that's just rebalancing to somewhere where we want and where we're using capacity more and more, we're using it less. We don't want to carry more than we need it with certain counterparties. So we always assess kind of size and dispersion of availability across the set that we hold on our books has offerings.\n\nStephen Laws\n\nGreat. And then I guess one last one up, Mike, I think the Q1 originations were about four, 65 over, I believe. Can you talk about the spreads you've generated on the the 165 million originations quarter to date.\n\nMichael Comparato\n\nI don't have the number on the quarter to date spreads. They're going to be tighter Steven? Yes, we as I mentioned, we closed that office loans in Q1 that was priced at so for nine 38. So that CO really offsetting our Q1 type number. So I can be comfortable in saying that we'll be inside of where it is for Sumant.\n\nStephen Laws\n\nOkay. Understood. Appreciate the comments this morning.\n\nOperator\n\nSteve Delaney, JMP Securities.\n\nSteve Delaney\n\nThanks. So congratulations on a solid start to 2024 everyone. Rich. There's a old saying among bankers that the only problem with making good loans is that they pay off too fast. I'm just curious if you feel when you look at the portfolio units today, do you think there is enough solid demand out there that you can maintain the portfolio above 5 billion. And on the other hand, with respect to potential new CLO, is there any chance to see net portfolio growth with your existing capital base? Thank you.\n\nRichard Byrne\n\nWell, since you called me out, Steve, I'll start at that answer. I agree, but I'm what the whole industry is dealing with now is all of those loans that record origination quarters across the street. All occurred in late 2020, mostly 2021 and beginning of 2022, all that stuff coming due. So your first problem is just resolving all that.\r\n And then getting on to the next vintage, we're really excited about this vintage because, as Mike said, you're resetting asset values and making new loans there and there isn't a lot of competition. Banks are on the sidelines. A lot of our peers are on the sidelines, and we're getting looks at great loans, maybe some loans we may never reviewed and have seen and as you know, better better terms. So I think that's the opportunity as far as being able to continue to grow the portfolio.\r\n Yes, I mean we have over 200 million of cash. We have a Walgreens book, that's another 100 million. That's really earning something resembling cash that when those assets get sold, we can redeploy and we're only running it 2.4 times leverage. You know, we don't we never really go much higher than that, but certainly provides us with some capacity to grow the book from there. So as we've said, I mean, I think people are going to look on this vintage of deals as one being one of the best, you know, I think when you look back on it that we've ever seen or certainly that we've seen in a long time, and we're going to continue to actively originate into this opportunity appreciate that color, Mike.\n\nSteve Delaney\n\nOne for you. First quarter, obviously, we're here. We've seen CMBS, certainly spreads tightening. It seems that it's encouraging more people to refi and go into fixed-rate conduit loans. And after a slow, you know, 2023 is sort of the light green and pedal to the metal on conduit. And and obviously 5% is probably not replicable every quarter. Just give us some sense for whether conduit lending this year could come close to the 384 million you did in 2022. What kind of a range tighter range might you suggest to us for gain on sale? Thank you very much.\n\nMichael Comparato\n\nThanks, Steve. Yes, I mean, first, it's a double GreenLight. We are originating as much as we can as fast as we can and more importantly, securitizing it as fast as we can because as tighter spreads can go in, they can can go the other way. So we want them to be touch and go on the balance sheet. But no, the group is very active in the space.\r\n And yes, I do think the Q. one on a profit margin basis is harder. I repeat and hard to repeat and scale. I think generally speaking where I would be very happy if we could do just $2 million a quarter for the rest of 2024 in the conduit, that would be really great. And if we can go exceed that in any given quarter, that's just a cherry on top, but an additional five, six 7 million of conduit revenue through the balance of 2024, I think would be a really good earnings stabilizer for us.\n\nSteve Delaney\n\nThat's great. That's helpful. And we can we can pick and choose their volume and margin numbers you. That's that's very helpful guidance for us on on what you expect from the Group for the year. Appreciate both your comments today. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nMatthew Erdner, JonesTrading.\n\nMatthew Erdner\n\nYour Morning, guys. Thanks for your question. Could you talk a little bit about cap rates and what you're underwriting to going in and exiting on these new deals?\n\nMichael Comparato\n\nI'm sure, Matt. I mean, do you want it across all asset classes or specific to multi? I mean, the more color you're willing to give I think that would be great. Sure. So multifamily is kind of a tale of two worlds today. And I would say that that's stabilized multifamily and non-stabilized multi-family, right, stabilized multifamily. Generally speaking for the past several quarters, we're seeing cap rates pretty much on top of where 10 year. Fannie Freddie coupons are.\r\n So if you can borrow from Fannie Freddie on a 60 LTVLTCIO. 10-year loan at 5.5, you're going to see cap rates generally 5.5%. I think on the non-stabilized multi front, where we're seeing those are being bought on a cap rate basis. We're seeing people generally, we look at them as yield cost versus replacement cost on buying an asset that was built in 2020 for 225,000 a key and to rebuild that asset today would cost me 300 so that they're not really trading on cap rate basis.\r\n They're more just your gross exposure or basis on a per unit on a per unit basis, I would say industrial is probably just a few ticks wider than multi-family on stabilized basis at retail. If you want to add another, maybe 100 basis points of that, again, depending on what it is, grocery-anchored is going to trade inside of power center, anchored strip and hospitality. We're still seeing kind of 7.5 to 8.5 depending on asset quality and market.\r\n And then office, I don't think office is trading based on a cap rate at all. That's just yield. The few trades that we are seeing steel price per pound and market and basically just a long term bet that you're buying it so cheap, that you'll be okay, five or 10 years from now?\n\nMatthew Erdner\n\nYes, right. That makes sense. And that's very helpful and good color there. And then are you guys still seeing opportunities for construction loans and, you know, what's your appetite going forward on that we are I think the stress at the bank level really hasn't abated. And with rates generally higher for longer, it doesn't appear that it's going to abate anytime soon. So I think they're squarely on the sidelines for the balance of 2024 and perhaps a decent part of 2025, right?\n\nMichael Comparato\n\nBanks don't typically jump into the pool cannonball style when they come back in, it's going to be a tone than an ankle than a knee, and that's going to take some time. So we do view it as an opportunity. We continue to close construction loans in Q1. I think some of our best risk returns are in our construction book. The issue is they're just inefficient assets for us because they dribble capital out little pieces over an extended period of time. So I love them from a risk return standpoint, not so great in terms of efficiency of capital deployment, but overall continuing to see opportunities and will continue to be active in the space, provided those opportunities persist for some.\n\nMatthew Erdner\n\nThank you, guys. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nMatthew Howlett, B. Riley.\n\nMatt Howlett\n\nThanks for taking my question. Just on your ROEs, I mean, I think you kind of asked in terms of targets this year, looks like clearly, the 8.9% was under you sort of there was some drag on that artificial drags this quarter going forward with the portfolio growth with the buyback would potentially some of the cash freed up from real estate sales. What's not to prevent that from going to say 12, 13% in that case?\n\nMichael Comparato\n\nWould you raise it? Hey, Matt, good morning and thank you for such a direct question. So I think I think we've all your rich, Jerry and myself have been pretty open that we do think the future is bright. We do think that we've got investable capital and are growing the portfolio. Every group we grew in Q1, and I think we're one of the most active originators in the market today. So we clearly want to continue to grow the portfolio. We have a path to grow the portfolio.\r\n There doesn't appear to be any massive walls preventing us from from growing the portfolio. So the short answer is yes, to everything you said, we would like to grow the portfolio. We would like to enhance our OE. and at the appropriate time. Obviously, in conjunction with conversations with the Board, if we feel we've adequately address the legacy portfolio and feel like we're comfortable, could we address the dividend going higher in the future?\r\n Absolutely.\n\nMatt Howlett\n\nYes. Do I think that that's a 2024 event? Probably not. But I do think that is a very, very real possibility. And one we talk about fairly regularly. And I guess I'm not asking for guidance, but you look at the second quarter number, clearly with the late stage portfolio growth in the first quarter, the drag from some of those not onetime-ish nonaccruals. And then with the buyback, accelerate me clearly got to distribute the US is on pace to be up in second quarter from the first quarter yes, all.\n\nMichael Comparato\n\nI mean, look, I think it's I think this is really my focus is less on looking out the windshield and more through the rearview mirror. And I think we've got a meaningful portfolio that we think we need to work through the rest of this year. And we just want to make sure that the legacy book has been cleaned up to a level where we don't have surprises right? There just wants to be a very, very we want to have a high conviction rate if we're going to address a dividend. And I think the legacy portfolio plays more of a role in that conversation than forward-looking origination yet, Matt, as those rates, I think the whole world is now convinced on higher for longer, which is making us skeptical.\r\n But right, you've got a lot of factors at play right now. And obviously the rates are part of that legacy book that come together. And the last thing I mean, the Walgreens and I think us analysts, I'm not sure how to model that that could be significant. If you can reinvest, we can get out of that and reinvest those into today's new originations, what you said or the best you've seen in years, just an update, what can you can you tell us to expect anything this year?\n\nMatt Howlett\n\nIs it just going to be opportunistic if someone hits your bid? Any color on how that process is going would be appreciated.\n\nMichael Comparato\n\nI mean where we're actively working on selling the portfolio, we recognize exactly what you recognize, right. We've got roughly $100 million of capital locked up, as Rich pointed out, making cash like returns when we historically are originating loans at much better than cash type returns. So we see the opportunity. We have a few stores under contract today. We have a few stores under letter of intent today. I'm hoping next quarter we can give you guys a more robust, a summary of where those stand, but not we're still in the process of getting these contracts nonrefundable actually closing. So we thought it was premature to address that today, but this is a front burner issue for us. It is clearly a place that we can improve the portfolio fastest and easiest. And we are we are very, very focused on getting as much of Walgreens resolved in 2024 as we can.\n\nRichard Byrne\n\nAnd the good news is we 22 hundred over 200, $240 million of cash to get us to spend first. So it's not like we're missing an opportunity now. We have plenty of liquidity even without it. So we're trying to be, as Mike pointed out, as disciplined as possible. You know, we want to sell into strength. So but with an eye towards sooner rather than later.\n\nMichael Comparato\n\nAnd there's no debt on that. I really have there's no financing on that at all Janos free and clear, right, that's going to be all cash back to you.\n\nMatt Howlett\n\nWe look forward to that.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, this concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Lindsey Crabbe for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nLindsey Crabbe\n\nWe appreciate you joining us today. If you have any further questions, please reach out to me or our team. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Walmart (WMT) announced it is closing down its healthcare business Tuesday. The move will impact 51 locations in five states, as well as relationships with health systems, like the one penned with Florida's Orlando Health in November.\n\nIn its announcement, Walmart cited a \"challenging reimbursement environment and escalating operating costs\" as contributing to a \"lack of profitability that make the care business unsustainable for us at this time.\"\n\nThe company declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on the business segment's profitability, or lack thereof.\n\n\"We continually assess our business, once we made the decision, we moved quickly and with appropriate speed, which we believe was in the best interest of our associates, patients and communities,\" Walmart said in an emailed response.\n\nA spokesperson said the locations would likely close within a 45- to 90-day time frame. Walmart store in suburb north of Pittsburgh. (bgwalker via Getty Images)\n\nWalmart is just the latest in a string of retail healthcare pullbacks.\n\nWalgreens (WBA) announced that it will close 160 of its VillageMD clinics and only maintain the busiest sites, just a few years after investing $5.2 billion to acquire a majority stake in the business.\n\nAnd recently, UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) Optum division confirmed it was ending its telehealth services \u2014 which it started offering during the pandemic at no out-of-pocket cost to members.\n\nIndustry challenges\n\nCraig Garthwaite, health economist and professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, said that Walmart relied too heavily on its retail strategy in the more complex healthcare system.\n\nThe idea that \"we use our scale to cut costs, deliver lower prices to gain share \u2014 that's just not going to work given the cost structure of what they were involved with here,\" Garthwaite said.\n\nEven with the volume of customers Walmart has walking through its doors daily, and the various attempts to expand its health offerings over the years \u2014 including as an insurer \u2014 it couldn't crack the code.\n\nSachin Jain, president and CEO of SCAN Health Group, said in part there's a disconnect between the healthcare business and the needs of for-profit publicly traded companies that have to think about profit and increasing shareholder value every three months.\n\n\"It raises the question of whether there is this incompatibility between building a reliable ... primary care business and the public markets in an environment where rates are declining,\" Jain said.\n\nThe reimbursement rates from insurers and the federal government's Medicare program have been blamed for razor-thin margins in hospitals and in physician practices.\n\nStory continues\n\nStephen Klasko, a former hospital CEO and currently at General Catalyst, told Yahoo Finance he believes this could be a lesson for other retail efforts, such as Amazon's (AMZN) One Medical.\n\nIf a newcomer to the health space isn't thinking about how to operate as an insurer or as a pharmacy simultaneously, \"it just doesn't work financially,\" Klasko said.\n\nHe also added that if Walmart, with its scale and resources, could not make it, it's unlikely that retail health will ever take off.\n\nWalmart's stock was trading down 2% Tuesday, at just above $59 per share.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. shares are capping off their worst month in more than five years as the troubled drugstore chain navigates a difficult turnaround that has caused Wall Street to flee the stock.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHSBC CEO Quinn Unexpectedly Steps Down After Almost 5 Years Tesla Soars on Tentative China Approval for Driving System Stocks Trade for 390 Minutes a Day.

But, Walgreens is betting a strategic review of its businesses can win back investors\u2019 confidence in the stock and restore growth.\n\n\u201cThe market has almost given up on this company given how long some of the challenges have remained,\u201d said Shams Afzal, a portfolio manager at Carnegie Investment Counsel. \u201cThe stock price is absolutely reflecting all of these pressures.\u201d\n\nManagement changes have plagued the company with Roz Brewer, the former chief executive officer, departing nearly eight months ago after efforts to push deeper into health care during her tenure proved more challenging than expected. The stock lost roughly half its value during her tenure.\n\nWalgreens declined to comment.\n\nThe Deerfield, Illinois-based company has also had to replace its chief financial officer, chief information officer and chief medical officer in the past year.\n\nRead more: Walgreens Replaces Chief Medical Officer in Latest Shakeup\n\nThe company is reportedly holding new talks to separate from Boots, its UK pharmacy chain, and exploring options for Shields Health Solutions, its specialty pharmacy business.\n\nBut, Wall Street is treating Walgreens as a wait-and-see story. Twelve of the analysts covering the stock rate it a hold with three saying buy and four recommending selling shares, according to Bloomberg compiled data.\n\nWalgreens\u2019 valuation premium at a five-year average of about six times forward earnings, is among the bottom 10 of the companies in the S&P 500, and another indicator of the Street\u2019s skepticism.\n\n\u201cRight now we have nothing to go on,\u201d Afzal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole lot of promises and almost a kitchen sink strategy, if you will, but we haven\u2019t seen any turnaround yet.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Barclays analyst Stephanie Davis, there are few outcomes from the strategic review that could put Walgreens back on the right path.\n\nIf the company decides to monetize its outperforming assets, then it loses the \u201cgood parts\u201d of its business, according to Davis. A sale of its underperforming assets on the other hand, could mean selling at a discount.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no easy solution that they can come up with in this turnaround that would make me feel 100% good about the outcome,\u201d said Davis, who currently rates the stock a sell-equivalent.\n\nWhat the stock really needs is a turnaround in the firm\u2019s patient-care business in the US, Davis added.\n\nOther companies\u2019 expansion into the market has not gone well.

An advance there could help drive the stock up some 20% from current levels, the analyst wrote in a note to clients.\n\n\u201cWhile we expect some additional news flow in the coming months regarding potential portfolio changes, we are most focused on any changes to the underlying profit trajectory in the US retail pharmacy business,\u201d said Anderson, who has an in-line rating on the stock.\n\nBarclays\u2019 Davis sees competition mounting on all sides, including from retail giants, grocers with pharmacies and online drug delivery services.\n\n\u201cYou have big box stores being a bigger threat,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThe online pharmacy threat, it will eventually grow as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the big question of what they want to be when they grow up,\u201d Davis said of the strategic review. \u201cWhat businesses do you keep, what businesses do you not keep?\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Fiona Rutherford.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nModi Is $20 Trillion Short on His Grand Plan for India\u2019s Economy Tesla Strike Has US Unions Taking Notes Biden Strategy to Tame Gas Prices Is in Peril as Iran Sanctions Pressure Mounts How to Book a Rocket Ride: Advice From a Space Travel Agent How the TikTok Law Could Intensify the US-China Tech Spat\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at\u00a0Democrats and Corporate Insiders are Buying These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Democrats and Corporate Insiders are Buying These 5 Stocks.\n\nEthical questions and concerns related to politicians trading stocks grew louder during the pandemic, where analysts saw various cases of Congressmen and Senators buying or selling stocks directly impacted by the coronavirus crisis. A research paper titled \"Failures of the STOCK Act and the Future of Congressional Insider Trader Reform\" says that in February 2020, Senator Richard Burr sold stocks worth between $628,000 and $1,720,000, while his brother in-law dumped stocks worth between $97,000 and $280,000. But what's wrong with selling stocks? The research paper highlights that the Senator had received special briefings on the COVID-19 crisis and attended a meeting with former Center for Disease Control Director Robert Redfield and Dr. Anthony Fauci a few days before these stock sales. The Senator allegedly foresaw the crisis brewing and sold his stocks to avoid a selloff that stuck the US stock market hard.\n\nDo Politicians Benefit from Insider Information? Data Says Yes\n\nThere have been various instances where politicians in America were seeing talking, lobbying, actively participating in discussions about issues that directly impact the stocks in their portfolios. For example, former US Senator from Georgia David Perdue was part of the Senate\u2019s cybersecurity subcommittee back in 2020. An analysis by The New York Times showed that Perdue had bought and sold cybersec company FireEye's stock around 60 times starting 2016. Perdue back in 2020 was citing FireEye's reports on cyber threats to the US and joined a group of lawmakers who wrote to a letter to Gen. Paul Nakasone, head of the military\u2019s U.S. Cyber Command, and Christopher Krebs, the top Homeland Security Department official at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, in April 2020, voicing their concerns regarding cyber threads from China, Iran, Russia and North Korea.\n\nThe Times' analysis said that out of the over 2,000 stock trades of Senator Perdue, nearly half \"occurred while he sat on the cybersecurity panel, a role that potentially could have provided him with nonpublic information about companies like FireEye.\" During this time, FireEye also received a subcontract worth about $30 million with the Army Cyber Command, which operated at Fort Gordon, in the Senator's home state.\n\nStory continues\n\nFireEye announced to acquire Mandiant in December 2013. Later, Mandiant was spun out of FireEye as part of a $1.2 billion deal with private equity firm Symphony Technology Group. In 2022, Google to revealed plans to acquire Mandiant for approximately $5.4 billion. Democrats and Corporate Insiders are Buying These Stocks\n\nPerformance and Returns of Politicians' Stock Picks\n\nBut moving beyond individual stock trades, what about the returns or performance of stocks owned by American politicians. Do US Congress members really beat the market? A 2011 study titled Abnormal Returns From the Common Stock Investments of Members of the U.S. House of Representatives authored by Alan J. Ziobrowski and James W. Boyd provides some key insights. \u00a0The study analyzed about 16,000 common stock trades by about 300 House delegates from 1985 to 2001. The results showed that stocks owned by House Representatives \"earn significant positive abnormal returns.\"\n\n\"A portfolio that mimics the purchases of House Members beats the market by 55 basis points per month (approximately 6% annually).\"\n\nThe research paper also points to another similar study they did on stock returns of US Senators:\n\n\"They examine abnormal returns from the common stock investments of U.S. Senators from 1993 to1998. Using the calendar-time portfolio approach, a portfolio that mimics the purchases of U.S. Senators outperforms the market by 85 basis points per month (approximately 10% per year). The positive abnormal returns for Senate stock acquisitions are both economically large and statistically significant. Although Democrats outperform Republicans, the researchers find no statistical difference between the abnormal returns earned by Members of the two political parties. However, the investments of Senators in their first term of office significantly outperformed the investments of the most senior Senators who had served more than two terms. On the other hand, Members of the House of Representatives are not Senators. Being one of 435, as opposed to one of 100, is likely to result in a significant dilution of power relative to members of the Senate. In addition, the filibuster rules in the Senate further amplify the influence of each Senator since the passage of controversial legislation in the Senate effectively requires the support of a super majority (60 Senators) under threat of filibuster. Thus, assuming that privilege is derived from power, the fact that Senators have been shown to enjoy a significant information advantage over ordinary investors (and the propensity to use it), would not necessarily lead us to expect that Members of the House of the Representatives enjoy the same access to financial information.\"\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first scanned the holdings of the Subversive Unusual Whales Democratic ETF (NANC) which invests in sold bought or sold by Democratic members of Congress and their spouses. From these stocks we picked 10 companies that saw insider buying activity over the past one year. Why is it important to see what insiders are doing? Insider Monkey\u2019s monthly newsletter and\u00a0portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs\u2019 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.\n\n10. Dollar Tree Inc (NASDAQ:DLTR)\n\nUnusual Whales Democratic ETF (NANC) Stake: $78,709.35\n\nDollar Tree's CFO Jeff Davis on April 1 bought 1,800 shares of the company at $136 per share. Since then the stock is down 12.6%. Daniel J.\u00a0Heinrich, a director at the company, bought 1,000 shares of the company on March 18 at $127.85 per share.\n\nMadison Investors Fund stated the following regarding Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR)\u00a0in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) underperformed in the quarter following a messy earnings report that showed inconsistent results at Family Dollar. Given it is still early in Family Dollar\u2019s turnaround effort, we had been expecting the potential for choppy performance, and weren\u2019t that surprised by the result. What we found more notable were the strong results from the Dollar Tree stores, as they are the primarily value driver for the overall company.\u201d\n\n9. Union Pacific Corp (NYSE:UNP)\n\nUnusual Whales Democratic ETF (NANC) Stake: $86,797.92\n\nUnion Pacific CEO Jim Vena on November 21 bought 4,500 UNP shares at $222 per share. Since then the stock is up 9%.\n\nCooper Investors made the following comment about Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe major focus in Texas was spending a day visiting operations of\u00a0Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), a Stalwart investment made earlier this year.\n\nOur investigations into the railroad industry have felt like a history lesson of the late 19th Century, a peek into the Gilded Age. At this time railroads became a transformative force that connected the East Coast to the Western frontier, pushing the economic potential of US industry and commerce to new heights. Over a century later and despite technological upheaval, the freight railroads of North America still feel just as relevant and a key part of the new industrial age.\n\nTo own, operate and invest in a railroad is to be a part of the lifeblood of North America. It is to witness the movement of grain, concrete, steel, wood, energy, autos, and shipping containers across vast distances. These are irreplaceable assets that could not be built today, and for the most part have very few substitutes \u2013 UNPs tagline \u201cBuilding America\u201d certainly rings true\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\n8. Corteva Inc (NYSE:CTVA)\n\nUnusual Whales Democratic ETF (NANC) Stake: $90,748.80\n\nCorteva saw heavy insider buying activity in November 2023. Its Executive Vice President, Chief Technology and Digital Officer Sam Eathington bought 1,094 shares of the company at $46.07 per share on November 28. Tim Glenn, Executive Vice President, Seed Business Unit, also snaped up 4,000 shares of the company at $45.99 per share on November 14. Since then the stock is up 20%.\n\nAristotle Capital\u2019s Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA)\u00a0in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cCorteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA), the seed and crop protection company, was one of the largest contributors. As discussed in last quarter\u2019s commentary, we believed the crop protection business was at or near a cyclical bottom in 2023, as customer destocking followed a 2020-2022 period of robust orders. Share prices have subsequently risen with Corteva\u2019s crop protection sales falling just 5% in the previous quarter, an improved result compared to the 9% full-year decline, accompanied by guidance calling for a return to growth in the second half of 2024. However, as long-term investors, we look past cyclical fluctuations and are encouraged as Corteva further executes on many of the catalysts we identified. These include continued innovation (with over 400 new product launches in 2023) and share gains for the company\u2019s Enlist E3 soybeans, which achieved 58% market penetration in 2023 and became the top-selling soybean technology in the U.S.\u201d\n\n7. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA)\n\nUnusual Whales Democratic ETF (NANC) Stake:$107,616.00\n\nDemocratic Congress members and corporate insiders like Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:WBA). The Unusual Whales Democratic ETF (NANC) owns 5900 shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:WBA). The total value of these shares was $107,616.00.

Wentworth bought 10,000 shares at a price of $24.22 per share. The transaction took place on January 5. Since then the stock is down 27%.\n\n6. Berry Global Group Inc (NYSE:BERY)\n\nUnusual Whales Democratic ETF (NANC) Stake: $141,739.36\n\nBerry Global Group Inc\u00a0(NYSE:BERY)\u00a0is one of the stocks Democrats and corporate insiders were buying. Kevin J. Kwilinski, Berry Global Group Inc's (NYSE:BERY)\u00a0CEO, \u00a0on February 9 loaded up on 2,000 shares of Berry Global Group Inc\u00a0(NYSE:BERY)\u00a0at $57.44 per share.

        "title": "Analysts Are Sounding the Alarm Bells on These 7 Stocks: April 2024",
        "content": "Just like how \u201cbuy\u201d ratings from Wall Street analysts can give you great ideas to add to your watchlist, \u201csell\u201d ratings from these analysts can also steer you away from the stocks to avoid.\n\nThat said, much like how not every stock rated \u201cbuy\u201d ends up being a profitable investment, not every stock rated \u201csell\u201d ends up in the stock market graveyard. Sure, given sell-side analysts assign stocks rarely assign \u201csell\u201d ratings. With this, you may be thinking \u201cif analysts are rating this stock a sell, things must be pretty bad.\u201d\n\nHowever, sometimes analysts only rate a stock a \u201csell\u201d just as the market is finishing up absorbing negative developments. Sometimes analysts overestimate the importance of valuation. Similar to individual investors, they overestimate the importance of both good and bad news about a particular stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, what \u201csell\u201d-rated stocks are truly stocks to avoid, and which are unfairly low-rated? Let\u2019s take a look at seven stocks that have received either a downgrade or a bearish analyst rating since the start of the year, and find out.\n\nNordstrom (JWN) A Nordstrom (JWN) storefront in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBack in March, Jeffries\u2019 Ashley Helgans downgraded Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) shares from \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201chold,\u201d with a price target of $17 per share. In her downgrade, the analyst cited the prospect of a longer-than-expected recovery of the department store chain\u2019s margins. Given this timeline, Helgans believes shares are fairly priced.\n\nJWN stock has not received any other sell-side downgrades lately, but it hasn\u2019t received much in the way of bullish coverage, either. Over the past year, two other analyst firms covering the stock have issued equivalent to \u201chold\u201d ratings on shares.\n\nThat said, while the analyst community may be on the fence about Nordstrom, there may be a new catalyst emerging. The Nordstrom family is reportedly interested in taking the company private. While this takeover talk is still in the rumor stage, the company\u2019s board has formed a committee to evaluate a possible take-private offer.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nCanaccord Genuity\u2019s Maria Ripps downgraded Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares from \u201cbuy\u201d to \u201chold,\u201d following the streaming giant\u2019s latest quarterly earnings release. She also reduced her price target from $720 to $585 per share.\n\nAccording to the analyst, there\u2019s little out there suggesting that revenue growth in the coming quarters will beat Netflix\u2019s latest guidance, which fell short of Wall Street expectations. While two other analyst firms issued bullish ratings on NFLX stock post-earnings, you may want to take heed of Ripps\u2019 on the fence view of shares, and consider it one of the stocks to avoid.\n\nStory continues\n\nNetflix may appear reasonably-priced compared to other mega cap tech stocks, but its forward valuation of 30.7 represents a massive premium to most media stocks. After surging nearly 75% over the past year, further upside may be limited. Moreover, some \u201cold media\u201d rivals are making progress with their own streaming ventures.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTwo weeks back, ahead of earnings, analysts at Guggenheim downgraded ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) from \u201cbuy\u201d to the equivalent of \u201chold.\u201d The sell-side firm did not assign a price target for the enterprise software firm\u2019s shares.\n\nA key reason behind the downgrade was valuation. Guggenheim believes that shares has limited upside, given NOW\u2019s current valuation relative to near-term prospects. Much like the aforementioned NFLX stock downgrade, other analysts have been more bearish than bullish on NOW stock.\n\nHowever, despite the post-earnings bullishness from the analyst community, a look at the latest numbers and outlook arguably gives more credence to Guggenheim\u2019s less-than-bullish view. Last quarter\u2019s results failed to wow the market, and the updates to outlook came in short of prior expectations. As NOW continues to trade at a rich forward multiple (53.6), downside risk could be substantial. For now, staying away is possibly your best course of action.\n\nPhilip Morris (PM) Philip Morris factory offices in Lithuania. PM stock.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nPhilip Morris (NYSE:PM) is another recent recipient of an analyst downgrade, but it may be up for debate whether it is truly one of the stocks to avoid. In March, analysts at Argus Research downgraded the tobacco company\u2019s shares.\n\nMoving PM stock from \u201cbuy\u201d to \u201chold,\u201d the Argus analysts cited declining tobacco usage and regulatory risks in their downgrade. Since this downgrade, however, shares in the company, which sells Marlboro cigarettes outside the U.S., and alternative cigarette/nicotine products in the U.S., has performed well.\n\nMost notably, following Philip Morris International\u2019s latest quarterly earnings release. In large part, thanks to strong growth with its non-cigarette product offerings. Reasonably-priced at 15.1 times forward earnings, and a nearly 5.5% forward dividend yield to boot, you may want to skip taking heed of Argus\u2019 mixed view of PM shares, and buy on the recent promising news.\n\nSpirit Airlines (SAVE) A yellow, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) branded airplane flying in the air\n\nSource: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.com\n\nGiven Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) crash landing when a planned merger with JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) was grounded by a court ruling, I\u2019m doubtful many investors are interested in hopping aboard this low-cost air carrier play.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019ve been mulling whether to go contrarian on SAVE stock, you may want to keep in mind the rationale behind Citigroup\u2019s downgrade of Spirit from the equivalent of \u201cneutral\u201d to \u201csell,\u201d when a Federal court ruled that the proposed deal violated antitrust law.\n\nBesides citing the court ruling would lead to a deal cancellation (which it did), the Citi analyst team also noted slim chances of another bidder emerging. To make matters worse, the analysts also argued that the carrier would likely continue to report negative EBITDA until 2025. As Spirit contends with high debt and negative cash flow, it\u2019s best to stay on standby with SAVE shares.\n\nUpstart Holdings (UPST) Person holding smartphone with logo of U.S. fintech company Upstart Network Inc. (UPST) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn past coverage of Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ:UPST) I\u2019ve called it one of the top stocks to avoid. Mostly, due to the fact that shares trade at a high multiple of forecasted 2025 results. This rich valuation contrasts with the latest guidance for this provider of AI-powered credit underwriting analysis.\n\nI\u2019m of course not the only one bearish on UPST stock. The short side of this trade remains very crowded. 34.1% of Upstart\u2019s outstanding float remains sold short. Also, earlier this month, analysts at BofA issued the equivalent of a \u201csell\u201d rating on UPST shares.\n\nIn this bearish analyst rating, BofA cited multiple concerns, including the sustainability of its funding model, which has increasingly entailed putting its own capital at risk. While giving UPST a $22 per share price target, taking into account the rich valuation and risks, it may safer to assume downside risk is much, much higher.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares in pharmacy chain Walgreen Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) have been in a slump for years. Even so, with shares in this Dow Jones component trading for only 5.5 times forward earnings, and sporting a 5.65% forward dividend yield, some may be deciding to buy it as a \u201cDogs of the Dow\u201d play.\n\nThe fact that WBA stock has become a turnaround play may also be piquing the interest of bottom-fishing investors. Yet while WBA may seem like it\u2019s bottomed out, rather than being deep value, consider it better to assume Walgreens Boots Alliance remains a value trap.\n\nDon\u2019t just take my word for it. Back in February, analysts at HSBC downgraded WBA from \u201chold\u201d to the equivalent to \u201csell,\u201d giving shares a $17 price target. In the downgrade, the analysts cited structural challenges that may limit the extent in which turnaround efforts improve fiscal results.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "DEERFIELD, Ill., April 25, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

        "content": "Walgreens (WBA) is standing up a new specialty pharmacy segment to compete in an increasingly crowded pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) and specialty pharmacy space.\n\nThe company announced Thursday its new business unit and brand name: Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy.\n\nThe business \"rolls up all Walgreens specialty pharmacy segment assets, including AllianceRx,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nAllianceRx is the combined entity that Walgreens and its then-partner and PBM Prime Therapeutics formed in 2017 that will merge into the new business unit in August.\n\n\"With approximately $24 billion in annual enterprise specialty revenue, Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy is the largest independent provider that offers the industry's most robust specialty capabilities not vertically aligned with a pharmacy benefit manager,\u201d said Rick Gates, chief pharmacy officer, in a statement.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance, vice president of pharmacy and specialty trade Pat Lupo said the target market is payers of health benefits \u2014 including insurance companies and large self-pay companies that are interested in diversifying their offerings.\n\nThe cost-cutting trend started in 2023 when Blue Shield of California split its pharmacy benefits between five entities, including newcomers Amazon Pharmacy (AMZN) and Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs \u2014 but maintained CVS Caremark (CVS) for specialty pharmacy.\n\n\"What we are doing with our combination of assets ... is creating something new from a pharmacy delivery platform perspective and integrated model, where we actually occupy a very strong middle ground between the big three integrated specialty pharmacy and the niche, very small bespoke specialty pharmacy,\" Lupo said.\n\nHe added that the combined revenue of the segment gives the company a chance to compete with the big three and place fourth. The big three include CVS, UnitedHealth's OptumRx (UNH), and Cigna's (CI) Evernorth Health Services, which includes Express Scripts.\n\nIn 2023, CVS reported mail and specialty revenue of $68 billion, or 6.5% growth versus 2022. OptumRx reported $63 billion in specialty pharmacy revenue in 2023, while Evernorth reported nearly $66 billion in revenue.

(dbdurden via Getty Images)\n\nBeyond PBM\n\nThe company anticipates not only working with private payers but also providing services to government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. In addition to managing the benefits, Walgreens said it would be able to help patients through 300 specialty pharmacies across the country, as well as four central specialty pharmacies.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is looking at ways to expand specialty drug needs into the future, with an eye on gene and cell services. Walgreens announced a new 18,000-square-foot center in Pittsburgh that would provide services for these newer therapies, including playing a role in \"the supply chain, logistics and financing,\" according to the statement.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe announcement Thursday comes amid investor doubts as new CEO Tim Wentworth shifts gears away from vertical integration \u2014 to include a focus on providing clinical care services \u2014 and refocuses the company in ways that target various aspects of drug and drug delivery.\n\nThat includes maintaining a clinical trial program, which competitor CVS backed out of last year, and giving retail store managers more control over how to engage with their local communities and drive business growth decisions.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "content": "In the changing environment of 2024, astute\u00a0investors have\u00a0a plethora of\u00a0options to strengthen their financial portfolios strategically by purchasing dividend stocks.\u00a0These prospects result from industry titans\u2019 forward-thinking initiatives and solid performance. The top seven of them are listed here.\n\nFor example, the first company distinguishes itself by spending substantial research and development to gain a competitive advantage in several therapeutic areas. Similarly, the second company\u2019s substantial expenditures on fiber networks and 5G put it in the lead in the telecom market.\u00a0Its solid cash flow and well-thought-out client retention tactics highlight the third company\u2019s stability and resilience. In the meantime, the fourth company\u2019s calculated acquisitions in the cancer and cardiovascular fields show that it is acutely aware of the need to capitalize on high-growth markets.\n\nFurthermore, the fifth company\u2019s innovative strides in pharmacy operations and digital expansion, the sixth company\u2019s successful return to market share, and the seventh company\u2019s dominance in distribution paint a vivid picture of diverse opportunities across multiple industries.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTop Dividend Stocks: Pfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer\u2019s (NYSE:PFE) research budget is the most massive in the industry, yielding a forward dividend of 6.4%. Here, the expenditures support cutting-edge technology and a solid pipeline. Pfizer\u2019s considerable investment in research reflects its focus on creating ground-breaking medicines in a range of therapeutic areas.\u00a0This\u00a0reflects Pfizer\u2019s focus on remaining at the edge of medical progress and fostering expansion by introducing sharp treatments.\n\nAdditionally, Pfizer\u2019s cancer research capacity increased overnight with the acquisition of Seagen, and by 2030, the company intends to launch\u00a0at least eight potential blockbuster drugs. This emphasizes Pfizer\u2019s calculated action to fortify its position in oncology, a therapeutic field expanding quickly. The doubling of resources through the Seagen purchase demonstrates\u00a0Pfizer\u2019s commitment to portfolio development and blockbuster potential, positioning the business for faster growth in the cancer sector.\n\nLastly, through its cost realignment initiative, Pfizer hopes to save at least\u00a0$4 billion in net costs by the end of 2024. Hence, Pfizer\u2019s emphasis on cost reduction and efficiency reflects its focus on increasing the bottom line and deriving long-term growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe forward dividend yield labeled with AT&T (NYSE:T) is 6.8%. AT&T announced a new aim to save an extra $2 billion or more by mid-2026. This happened after exceeding its original objective of $6 billion or more in run-rate costs. Despite higher-than-anticipated CapEx in fiber and 5G networks, AT&T derived $16.8 billion in free cash flow (in 2023).\n\nIndeed, reaching cost-saving goals ahead of schedule signifies AT&T\u2019s edge in financial efficiency. In short, the company is skilled at managing operating costs. In 2023, AT&T\u2019s mid-band 5G network covered over 210 million people. By the end of 2025, the company may have connected over\u00a026 million residential and commercial locations to its fiber network. Thus, AT&T\u00a0is focused\u00a0on investing in tech and infrastructure to satisfy changing customer and market expectations, reflecting the growth of its 5G and fiber network capabilities.\n\nLastly, expanding AT&T\u2019s network coverage and reach strengthens its competitive advantage and market positioning, establishing\u00a0the company\u00a0as a pioneer in high-speed internet and mobile connections.\n\nTop Dividend Stocks: Verizon (VZ) Verizon Retail Location. Verizon delivers wireless, high-capacity fiber optics and 5G communications. VZ stock\n\nSource: RAMAN SHAUNIA / Shutterstock.com\n\nVerizon (NYSE:VZ)\u00a0has\u00a0a 6.9% forward dividend yield. In Q1 2024, Verizon derived $2.7 billion in free cash flow, a more than 16% boost over the same period last year. Verizon\u2019s solid cash flow production highlights the company\u2019s prudent capital deployment and sound financial standing.\n\nMoreover, Verizon\u2019s postpaid phone net additions performance increased in Q1 2024, reducing the\u00a0net loss of 158K despite adopting price adjustments.\u00a0This\u00a0is a considerable improvement of more than 100K net earnings compared to the previous year\u2019s period. Hence, this demonstrates how Verizon\u2019s distinct value offer and focused retention initiatives have helped it draw in new business and keep hold of its current clientele.\n\nIn addition to offering\u00a0special\u00a0benefits like the\u00a0myPlan program and bundled services like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)\u00a0Plus Max, Verizon\u2019s segmented go-to-market strategy has been crucial in strengthening customer ties, leading to recurring top-line.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has a forward dividend yield of 3.3% and more than six decades of dividend growth. The company\u2019s acquisition of Shockwave Medical is a calculated attempt to boost its market lead in the cardiovascular treatment segment.\n\nCritically, Johnson & Johnson gained access to\u00a0Shockwave\u2019s cutting-edge intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) technology. This treats peripheral and coronary artery disease. This acquisition aligns with Johnson & Johnson\u2019s plan to become the top MedTech business in\u00a0cardiovascular intervention\u2019s high-growth markets.\n\nMoreover, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s oncology portfolio\u00a0is solidified. The company\u2019s capacity to provide precision biologics for cancer therapy improved with the conclusion of the Ambrx purchase. Johnson & Johnson has an oncology portfolio boost through\u00a0Ambrx\u2019s antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) platform and promising pipeline.\u00a0This\u00a0also increases the company\u2019s capacity to create targeted cancer medicines.\n\nFinally, Johnson & Johnson\u00a0is focused\u00a0on growing its market share in the oncology sector. This strategic acquisition reflects its goal of meeting unmet medical demand in cancer therapy.\n\nTop Dividend Stocks: Walgreens (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens\u2018 (NASDAQ:WBA) dividend yield is 5.5%. To support pharmacy services, Walgreens has invested in 11 micro-fulfillment facilities, which comprise more than half its total footprint. This growth demonstrates the company\u2019s focus on boosting pharmacy operations and raising customer satisfaction levels through fulfillment process optimization.\n\nFurthermore, there are observable advantages to using micro-fulfillment centers, such as higher NPS ratings, patient retention, and adherence. These facilities have improved the general pharmacy experience for consumers by freeing pharmacists and technicians to focus more on activities involving interacting with clients.\n\nAdditionally, Walgreens can concentrate on clinical operations and broaden pharmacy services beyond standard dispensing by implementing micro-fulfillment centers. This change in strategy demonstrates the company\u2019s focus on using its pharmacists\u2019 knowledge base to deliver better healthcare services to people. Sales on Boots.com increased considerably from the previous year. It now accounts for more than\u00a017% of retail sales in the UK.\n\nTo conclude, this foray into the online market demonstrates the efficacy of Walgreens\u2019 endeavors to augment its online visibility and leverage the burgeoning e-commerce phenomenon within the retail pharmacy sector.\n\nBritish American Tobacco (BTI) British American Tobacco logo on a building\n\nSource: DutchMen / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe forward dividend yield for British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) is 10.1%. Due to a 1.6% gain in the premium category, BTI\u2019s volume share in the U.S. premium segment has improved by 0.4% since January. Regaining market share in the premium area of the U.S. market reflects that British American Tobacco executes business strategy and marketing initiatives sharply.\n\nIndeed, the rise in volume share indicates that, in contrast to rivals, customers are reacting favorably to BTI\u2019s product offers. Regaining market share in the U.S. indicates that BTI is becoming more competitive in a considerable market. It shows the potential for top-line growth and bottom-line in the area. Similarly, it reflects how well the company\u2019s attempts to make up lost ground have worked.\n\nFinally, having saved close to \u00a3500 million in 2023, BTI hopes to save an additional \u00a31 billion by 2025. Efficiency gains show how BTI prioritizes operational excellence and cost reduction. These savings improve the company\u2019s solid flexibility, freeing up funds for wise investments, debt paydowns, or shareholder dividends.\n\nAltria (MO) Altria office sign in Virginia capital city tobacco business closeup by road street\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltria (NYSE:MO) has a forward dividend yield of 9.2% and a dividend growth history spanning more than 50 years. The company is focused on expanding accessibility to its smoke-free products. This\u00a0is reflected\u00a0in the quick growth of NJOY ACE distribution to over 75K outlets. Altria has successfully expanded its market reach by exceeding its distribution objectives. The company is capturing a substantial share of the e-vapor and cigarette sales channels. Thus, Altria\u2019s broad distribution network gives them a competitive edge in reaching many consumers.\n\nMoreover, NJOY ACE is now available in over 75K outlets, indicating a considerable rise in Altria\u2019s smokeless goods retail presence. Altria\u2019s success\u00a0surpassing its initial target of 70K shops indicates its distribution strategy\u2019s efficacy and capacity to accelerate market penetration.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that these outlets account for around 75% of the volume of e-vapor and 55% of the volume of cigarettes in the multi-outlet and convenience channel in the U.S. highlights Altria\u2019s strategic location inside\u00a0important\u00a0distribution channels. Therefore, by gaining a sizable portion of these channels, Altria improves its capacity to meet customer demand for smokeless alternatives and fortifies itself competitively.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in PFE, T, VZ, JNJ, WBA and BTI.

        "content": "Because dividend investing has such an impressive track record of beating non-dividend-paying stocks, many investors buy Dividend Aristocrats for their portfolios. It\u2019s not a bad strategy to begin with.\n\nDividend Aristocrats are stocks on the S&P 500 that have consistently raised their payouts for 25 years or more. Studies show stocks that initiate a dividend and then raise them over time have outperformed all other stocks over time. Yet, there are limits to the strategy.\n\nAs Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) showed earlier this year, even dividend royalties can run into problems. The pharmacy chain had increased its payout for almost 50 years but slashed its dividend nearly in half because it ran into money troubles. AT&T (NYSE:T) cut its dividend in half when it spun off its entertainment division into Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, just focusing on how long a stock has raised its dividend is not enough. What investors need to do is focus on dividend growth stocks that can afford to keep making their payouts. Growing a dividend at double-digit rates and generating enough free cash flow (FCF) to maintain the payout ensures a business will keep sharing its wealth with investors.\n\nThe following seven dividend growth stocks also have the free cash flow (FCF) to back up the payments.\n\nLVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMUY) The logo for the luxury goods holding company LVMH is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nLuxury goods retailer LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (OTCMKTS:LVMUY) is one of the first dividend growth stocks to consider for your portfolio. The owner of Fendi, Dior and Dom Perignon has a 10-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for its dividend of 12.59% while growing FCF at a 13.9% CAGR. FCF is important for dividend investors because that\u2019s how companies support their payout. There are only five things a business can do with the cash it has left over after paying its bills and paying a dividend is one of them.\n\nLVMH is one of the top stars in luxury retail, offering goods from apparel and watches to alcohol and textiles. While it tends to be recession-resistant, the company is not bulletproof. The rich can hold out much longer than the rest of us, but even inflation and high interest rates catch up with the uber-well-to-do, too.\n\nThat\u2019s the situation with LVMH, which reported slowing first-quarter sales. But that\u2019s not surprising considering the huge growth it enjoyed last year in its first post-pandemic-free quarter. Because comparisons get easier later on, expect LVMH stock to rebound sharply. In the meantime, collect the quarterly dividend that yields 1.7% annually.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nHealth insurer UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is the next dividend growth stock investors should have on their list. It\u2019s another recession-resistant issue because healthcare is something you can\u2019t ignore, at least not for very long. Doctor visits, prescriptions and emergency services are all vital for survival, meaning the insurer will always be in demand.\n\nThat\u2019s played out with UnitedHealth stock, which has grown its revenue, profits and dividend in excess of 10% annually over the past decade. The dividend had a 21% CAGR over that period, while its current FCF ratio at the end of 2023 was 10%.\n\nUNH views home healthcare, in particular, as a driver of the company\u2019s future growth. Its Optum health services unit will be a key component for its expansion. UnitedHealth, though, has been scooping up several services businesses related to the niche, including\u00a0LHC Group and Amedisys (NASDAQ:AMED). However, the latter deal is getting scrutinized more closely by regulators. It is not essential to UnitedHealth Group\u2019s outlook, even if the deal is quashed.\n\nDick\u2019s Sporting Goods (DKS) Exterior of Dick's Sporting Goods retail store including sign and logo.\n\nSource: George Sheldon via Shutterstock\n\nOutdoor action retailer Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) continues building on its impressive record of dividend growth. Its average payout was 27% for the last 10 years, while it generated FCF at the white-hot rate of 33% annually.\n\nEven when sales faltered, such as when it chose to get caught up in the gun control debate and eliminate firearms from its stores, Dick\u2019s kept growing the dividend. A boycott by hunters and other shooting sports enthusiasts sent sales reeling for a year. However, Dick\u2019s chose to focus on higher margin sales, such as baseball apparel and equipment, which eventually padded its bottom line. Firearms were a popular item but were a low-margin business.\n\nToday, Dick\u2019s business is robust. Net sales jumped 5% last year, generating gross profit growth of 35%. The retailer also raised its dividend by 10% to $1.10 per share each quarter.\n\nDomino\u2019s (DPZ) Domino's (DPZ) sign on a building at night\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPizza delivery specialist Domino\u2019s (NYSE:DPZ) has a history of raising its payout at high double-digit rates for the past decade, but recently announced it was increasing the payout by nearly 25% this year. Business has been strong for the pizza shop as it floods the market with stores in a strategy it calls \u201cfortressing.\u201d\n\nBy creating a ubiquitous feeling about its presence, Domino\u2019s keeps its stores uppermost in consumers\u2019 minds when they want to order food away from home. It also saves on marketing costs, as one ad covers many stores. That\u2019s how sales rose 4% in 2023, but profits increased 15%.\n\nDomino\u2019s has a near-20% CAGR for its dividend but also a better-than 12% increase in FCF. Like its big dividend hike last year, FCF surged over 25%, easily supporting the payout. With an FCF payout ratio under 35%, the pizzeria has plenty of room for future double-digit dividend increases. Look for Domino\u2019s to grow its dividend for many years to come.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nPharmaceutical stock AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) was granted Dividend Aristocrat status because it was spun off from Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) a decade ago. However, the offspring has gone on to outshine the former parent since then. Where Abbott Labs has a solid 9.6% dividend CAGR for the last decade, AbbVie has a 13.9% CAGR over the same period. Moreover, AbbVie is generating significantly more free cash flow as well. It produced $22 billion in FCF last year versus just $5 billion from Abbott Labs.\n\nWhile Abbott\u2019s record is still a testament to its own business and is a worthwhile stock to own, AbbVie is growing at a blistering pace and is even more attractive. It still produces mountains of cash, growing FCF at a 14% CAGR, it remains a stock to own now and for the long run. Even as sales of its blockbuster arthritis therapy Humira slowly ease up after losing patent protection, the pharma stock still has a portfolio of billion-dollar drugs that are taking its place.\n\nAutomatic Data Processing (ADP) In this photo illustration the stock market information of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. displays on a smartphone with the logo of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP stock.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock\n\nPayroll leader Automatic Data Processing (NYSE:ADP) may be a surprise stock for some. It seems such a sleepy business to have a decade-long run growing its dividend and FCF at double-digit rates. Some stocks become so well-known and are so commonplace that they simply blend into the background. Yet, ADP stock continues churning out profits and cash that pay for its dividend year in and year out.\n\nWhile revenue has grown at just a 5% CAGR for the past decade, profit growth has doubled that and free cash flow grew nearly 10% annually. That\u2019s allowed the payroll company to raise its dividend by over 11% a year almost in the shadows. In that vein, ADP raised the payout another 12% for this year.\n\nMany investors will look at ADP\u2019s 2.3% yield and scoff at buying it. What they need to realize is that 10 years ago, its payout was $1.79 per share. Over the years, the dividend has grown 287%, meaning an investor\u2019s yield on cost would have nearly quadrupled as well.\n\nHome Depot (HD) Home Depot (HD) storefront on a sunny day\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast, but investors shouldn\u2019t think of as least, is home improvement center Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Although the retailer gets overshadowed by rival Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW) 50-plus year history of increasing its own payout, Home Depot\u2019s recent record of raising its dividend is worth noting.\n\nHome Depot has a 17% 10-year dividend growth CAGR compared to 20% at Lowe\u2019s. But Big Orange generated nearly twice as much FCF growth at 11.1% over that period as Big Blue did at 6.9%. Home Depot also generated $18 billion in FCF last year compared to $6.2 billion at Lowe\u2019s. So, it is growing bigger cash flows faster, which is an impressive feat.\n\nThat\u2019s likely because it has been the go-to location for professional contractors. Even in the face of rampant inflation that we\u2019ve seen over the past few years, which dampened the enthusiasm for home improvement projects, the retailer was able to continuously raise its payout. There aren\u2019t many businesses that could withstand the toll of high prices and high-interest rates, but Home Depot has stood tall through it all.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in WBA, T, WBD, LVMUY, ABBV and LOW stock.

        "content": "The rubber hit the road on April 15 as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced it was cutting more than 10% of its global headcount to reduce costs and increase productivity.\n\n\u201cAs we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,\u201d Investor\u2019s Business Daily reported Elon Musk\u2019s comments from his memo sent to employees.\n\n\u201cWe are developing some of the most revolutionary technologies in auto, energy and artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOf course, with all the executive departures, he might need someone to help him achieve all these amazing things he has in store for the world.\n\nOne thing that rings true in Musk\u2019s comments is the CEO\u2019s suggestion that the company\u2019s rapid growth has led to the duplication of some jobs and functions in certain parts. What, specifically, are these areas of overlap and redundancy? We won\u2019t know until the cuts are made.\n\nIn the meantime, plenty of other companies in the S&P 500 could use a little downsizing.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve never been a fan of overhiring or overfiring, sometimes you overshoot, requiring a rightsizing to balance expenses with growth.\n\nHere are three that stand out for me.\n\nExpeditors International of Washington (EXPD) logistics stocks. supply chain stocks\n\nSource: Travel mania / Shutterstock.com\n\nExpeditors International of Washington (NYSE:EXPD) isn\u2019t an obvious candidate for job cuts. It makes money, and its shares have been up 45% for the past five years. While that doesn\u2019t compare to the 70% gain for the index, at least it\u2019s in positive territory.\n\nThe big issue for the Seattle-based logistics company is that its revenues and profits are cratering.\n\nIn Q4 2023, its revenues dropped 34% to $2.3 billion, while its operating income fell 40% to $199 million, an operating margin of 8.7%. That\u2019s 140 basis points less than TFI International (NYSE:TFII), a Canadian logistics and transportation company.\n\nExpeditors finished 2023 with 18,000 employees. Five years ago, it had the same number of employees and about the same revenue and operating income as this past year.\n\nAll its growth vanished in 2023.\n\nNo wonder none of the 17 analysts covering its stock have a Buy rating, while nine believe it\u2019s a Sell, with a target price of $108.50, below where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\nAs for TFII, 16 of the 20 analysts rate it a Buy. The cream always rises to the top.\n\nIllinois Tool Works (ITW) Illinois Tool Works (ITW) logo magnified while being displayed on a web browser\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nIllinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW), like Expeditors, isn\u2019t an obvious candidate for job cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough its revenue has fallen by 10% over the past decade, its operating profits and margins have improved dramatically. As a result, its earnings per share of $9.74 in 2023 is 3x higher than in 2012, a compound annual growth rate of 16.8%.\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem, you might ask? If you compare its stock\u2019s performance over the past five years, it\u2019s underperformed by 150 percentage points relative to GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE). Kudos to GE CEO Larry Culp for turning something awful into something valuable. It wasn\u2019t easy.\n\nAccording to the Liberated Stock Trader, ITW has 46,000 employees in 2024. The company\u2019s 10-K doesn\u2019t say how many. However, the proxy says it was 45,000 at the end of December, with two-thirds outside the U.S. In 2019, it was also 45,000.\n\nThe board will note that margins have improved significantly over the past decade and that ITW has a 10-year annualized total return of 13.02%. However, the majority of the gains came between 2012 and 2017 (up 269% through January 2018), compared to 45% from January 2018 through April 2024.\n\nIf you\u2019re not increasing your employee headcount, you\u2019re really not growing. It\u2019s better to sell off the least-performing businesses, as GE did, and become less of a conglomerate. Investors will pay up for that.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the introduction, I said I would only include companies from the S&P 500. And even though Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) was booted from the index in February\u2014Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) replaced it\u2014it has become bloated with way too much overhead beyond any reasonable justification.\n\nAccording to the Liberated Stock Trader, Walgreens had 325,000 employees at the beginning of January. The company\u2019s 10-K (Aug. 31, 2023, is the latest fiscal year) put the number at 331,000, with 38% part-time working 30 hours or less weekly.\n\nWell, the company is doing layoffs \u2014 InvestorPlace\u2019s William White reported on April 18 that the company was cutting staff from its Chicago facility and reducing the hours for employees in the stores by 4-7% \u2014 and has been for months, it can\u2019t cut deep enough to deliver shareholder value.\n\nI was a fan of the former CEO, Roz Brewer, who joined the company in March 2021 but stepped down last September. The company\u2019s move into healthcare wasn\u2019t where Brewer wanted to go with the company. She and the board appear to have agreed to disagree. That\u2019s merely my speculation on the matter.\n\nAt the time of her departure, I suggested three possible candidates to replace her\u2013the former CEO of pharmacy benefits management company Express Scripts.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a decent hire, WBA needs to cut more fat from the top down. I guess we\u2019ll see.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "If you\u2019re looking for reliability in a crazed market, jump into safer blue-chip stocks.\n\nWhile they\u2019re not all the most exciting stocks on the market, they have proven themselves to be ultra-reliable in any economic environment.\u00a0They all have proven business models, strong track records, sales, reputations and oftentimes, dividends to boot.\u00a0That\u2019s because most offer products and services that millions of us use every day.\n\nEven better, after a recent pullback in the broader markets, some of the top blue-chip stocks are on sale. Look at\u00a0AT&T (NYSE:T), for example. After testing a high of $17.59, it pulled back to $16.33, where it caught support and is just starting to pivot higher. Plus, it\u2019s over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams\u2019 %R, which tells us it\u2019s overdue to bounce. And while you wait for the AT&T stock to recover, you can collect its yield of 6.8%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are seven more top blue-chip stocks to buy and hold today.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the last few weeks, shares of Nike (NYSE:NKE) gapped from about $100 to a low of $88.80. However, it\u2019s starting to pivot higher, and could soon refill that gap at around $100. Helping,\u00a0Bank of America analysts just upgraded the NKE stock to a buy rating with a price target of $113. The firm argues NKE has a newer line up of footwear and apparel products. Plus, the upcoming Olympics should have a positive impact on the stock, too.\n\nJPMorgan also reiterated its overweight rating on the stock\u00a0with a price target of $164. The firm pointed to Nike\u2019s improvement in China. In addition, Morgan Stanley says retailers are seeing improving sequential demand trends for athletic apparel.\n\nBetter, earnings negativity has been priced into the stock. Investors weren\u2019t too enthused when the company said growth was near zero, or that management expected for revenue to pull back in the first half of fiscal 2025, which starts in June. But again, that appears to be priced in.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThere\u2019s also \u201cThe Monthly Dividend Company,\u201d\u00a0Realty Income (NYSE:O).\n\nWith a yield of 5.93%, the real estate investment trust (REIT) is also a buy on weakness. In fact, after slipping from $54.39 to $50.65, it\u2019s now starting to pivot higher again. Better, while we wait for it to recover, we can collect its monthly dividend. Its latest one for 25.7 cents is payable on May 15 to shareholders of record as of May 1. This is the company\u2019s 646th consecutive monthly dividend with many more on the way.\n\nStory continues\n\nRealty Income has been around for more than 50 years now. It has 13,100 properties, and it\u2019s still seeing strong demand with an occupancy rate of 99%.\n\nSome of its top tenants include\u00a0Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Walgreen\u2019s (NASDAQ:WBA), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), BJ\u2019s (NYSE:BJ), CVS (NYSE:CVS), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW) to name just a few. It\u2019s definitely one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nFidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (FBCG) Fidelity sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOr, if you want to diversify at low cost with blue-chip stocks, there\u2019s always an exchange-traded fund, such as the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (CBOE:FBCG).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF \u201cfocuses on companies we believe have above-average earnings growth potential with sustainable business models, for which the market has mispriced the rate and/or durability of growth,\u201d as noted by Fidelity.\n\nTop holdings include\u00a0Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to name a few.\n\nEven more impressive, since bottoming out at around $27 in late October, the ETF hit a high of about $39. It just recently pulled back with the broader market to $36.84. Now oversold on RSI, MACD, and Williams\u2019 %R, that weakness is an opportunity. From its current price of $36.84, I\u2019d like to see the ETF challenge $40 a share initially.\n\nWhat\u2019s nice about an ETF like this one is we can diversify with top blue-chip stocks. All for less than $37 a share at the moment.\n\nVanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund (VIG) vanguard website displayed on a mobile phone screen representing vanguard etfs\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother hot blue-chip ETF to consider is the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund (NYSEARCA:VIG).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.06%, the VIG ETF currently yields 1.76%. its last payout of 76.92 cents was paid on March 27. The next one should be out by June. It also holds 340 stocks, including Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). All in its effort to track the performance of the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index.\n\nSince bottoming out at around $150, the VIG ETF ran to a high of $183.02. Since then, it has dipped to $173.63, where it\u2019s over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams\u2019 %R. From its last traded price, I\u2019d like to see it initially retest $182.07 and head to $200 near term.\n\nWhat\u2019s nice about this ETF is we can gain exposure to 340 of the world\u2019s top stocks. All for less than $175 a share at the moment. Plus, we can collect its yield as it appreciates.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can also look at\u00a0Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), which we\u2019re all familiar with.\n\nWith a yield of 2.56%, the consumer goods company is also a buy on recent weakness. After pulling back from about $160, it\u2019s now technically oversold at $157.29. It\u2019s also over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams\u2019 %R and is just starting to pivot higher. Initially, I\u2019d like to see the PG stock retest its prior high and push to at least $170 near term.\n\nIt also just raised its\u00a0quarterly dividend to $1.0065, a 7% jump from its prior dividend of 94.07 cents. It\u2019s payable on May 15 to shareholders of record as of April 19.\n\nHelping,\u00a0Barclays just reiterated a buy rating on the PG\u00a0stock with a price target of $168. Analysts at Deutsche Bank also raised their price target to $172 with a buy rating. The firm says \u201cyear-to-date consumption trends for Procter remain solid in tracked channels. The firm sees little risk to near-term earnings numbers given the company\u2019s ongoing productivity momentum and relative cost favorability,\u201d as noted by TheFly.com.\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) An angled side view of a row of parked cars. automotive stock picks\n\nSource: lumen-digital / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last time I mentioned\u00a0Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC), it traded at $135 on Nov. 17.\n\nAt the time, I noted, \u201cUse the weakness as an opportunity. While we wait for the eventual recovery here, we can collect its 2.76% yield. We can profit from capital appreciation, and get paid to wait.\u201d Just a few months later, GPC is now up to $160.23 and could see higher highs.\n\nNow yielding 2.5%, the stock rocketed 11.2% higher on Thursday after raising its fiscal year 2024 profit guidance. For the year, it expected to post EPS of $8.95 to $9.15. Now it expects to post EPS of $9.05 to $.9.20, which boosted investor confidence.\n\nEven better, its dividend \u2013 which has been increased consistently for 67 years \u2013 is safe. In the first three months of 2024,\u00a0the company said it \u201cused\u00a0$175 million\u00a0in cash for financing activities, including\u00a0$133 million\u00a0for quarterly dividends paid to shareholders and\u00a0$38 million\u00a0for stock repurchases. Free cash flow was\u00a0$203 million.\u201d\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) The website for Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) looks good on weakness, too.\n\nAfter dropping to $58.18 from $61, it\u2019s now oversold on RSI, MACD and Williams\u2019 %R. But it is starting to bounce back fast. From its last traded price of $58.91, I\u2019d like to see it retest $61. Better, while we wait for it to recover, we can collect its yield of about 3.3%. Its latest dividend of 48.5 cents was recently paid out on April 1. Annualized, it\u2019s $1.94 and is the company\u2019s 62nd consecutive annual dividend increase.\n\nPlus, \u201cThe company returned $8 billion in dividends to shareowners in 2023, bringing the total amount of dividends paid to shareowners since Jan. 1, 2010, to $84.7 billion,\u201d\u00a0as noted in a recent press release. Helping, analysts at Barclays just raised their price target on KO to $68 with an overweight rating.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 10 best healthcare stocks to buy under $20. To skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare sector, you can go directly to see the\u00a05 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy Under $20.\n\nGlobal Healthcare Outlook for 2024\n\nAs 2024 progresses, the optimism surrounding the healthcare sector also continues to rise. While many investors were disillusioned with healthcare stocks in 2023 based on the sector's underperformance, especially relative to the technology and communication services sectors, financial analysts are so far expecting greater things from healthcare in 2024. According to BlackRock's 2024 outlook for healthcare, investors can expect a \"favorable risk-reward environment\" for healthcare this year. The outlook report noted that healthcare's underperformance in 2023 has created an attractive entry point for investors looking to buy into this sector this year. The report said that the weighted average P/E of the MSCI World Healthcare index was trading at a 5% discount relative to the broader market as of this January.\n\nConsidering this, coupled with healthcare companies' expected 12-month forward earnings growth, BlackRock foresees the healthcare sector to lead among all other sectors on a year-on-year basis in terms of its earnings growth, with only the information technology and consumer discretionary sectors being ahead of healthcare. As such, several major healthcare companies such as Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) are beginning to attract greater investor attention in 2024 because of their projected profitability.\n\nHealthcare Trends\n\nThe main sub-spaces to keep an eye on in healthcare this year include the pharmaceutical, medical devices and supplies, robotics, biotechnology, and neurodegenerative diseases areas. In terms of pharmaceuticals, the main trend of interest to interests is the rise and evolution of glucagon-like Peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1s), which have impacted weight reduction drugs significantly and have entirely changed the playing field in this area. Additionally, the rise of GLP-1s has also resulted in pharmaceutical companies offering weight loss drugs to benefit further from increased prescription volumes and sales. For instance, BlackRock noted that GLP-1 prescription volumes grew at a compound annual growth rate of 45% from 2019 to August 2023. The main contributors to this growth were notably Ozempic and Mounjaro, developed by leading pharmaceutical producers Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), respectively. This has also resulted in the popularity of weight loss drug stocks rising recently.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the rise of GLP-1s, many investors have become concerned about the impact of reductions in weight and related diseases through these drugs, particularly in relation to the medical devices and supplies sub-space. With patient populations for these conditions expected to decrease, investors are worried about a likely fall in demand for medical devices used in treating such patients. However, according to BlackRock, any impact on the medical devices industry in this regard is expected to be minimal. Resultantly, calls for selling medical device stocks may be premature.\n\nWhen it comes to robotics, investors can find lucrative opportunities within the surgical robotics space as technological advancements in healthcare continue to develop. BlackRock forecasts that as a consequence of headwinds in the medical robotics area, operational deficiencies are now in greater focus than ever before, which has resulted in greater urgency for the development and use of advanced technology in the healthcare sector to enhance patient care.\n\nTech in Healthcare\n\nIn terms of tech involvement in healthcare, perhaps the most exciting area for investors today is artificial intelligence disruption in this sector. On April 8, Amir Dan Rubin, the CEO of Healthier Capital, joined CNBC's \"The Exchange\" to discuss the rise of AI disruption in healthcare and where this is being observed most. Here are some of his comments:\n\n\"I think we're gonna see it all over healthcare, both on the demand side, how consumers and employers interact with healthcare, and on the supply side, how we deliver healthcare more efficiently. Healthcare is a fifth of the economy, close to the fifth of the economy in the US, about 11% of GDP globally, so it's a massive opportunity. And really, consumers are struggling in getting access to care, and then on the supply side, we're having a struggle finding labor and clinicians to get easy access. So automating a lot of healthcare is going to be really important as we head to the next decade.\"\n\nFor investors looking to benefit from the healthcare sector this year, remaining apprised of these major trends and keeping an eye on which insiders are piling into healthcare stocks today will be essential. Additionally, following the news surrounding some of the best affordable names in the healthcare sector to buy into today is another necessary step. As such, we have compiled a list of some of the best healthcare stocks to buy today, including some cheap healthcare stocks and some undervalued healthcare stocks to buy. 10 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy Under $20\n\nScientist in a lab working on a research project, focusing on biotechnology and healthcare advancements.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best healthcare stocks to buy, we used a stock screener to first identify healthcare stocks with share prices below $20 as of April 15. We then used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter to shortlist the top 10 stocks according to hedge funds. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by over 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nBest Healthcare Stocks to Buy Under $20\n\n10. R1 RCM Inc. (NASDAQ:RCM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 30\n\nShare Price: $12.4\n\nR1 RCM Inc. (NASDAQ:RCM) is based in Murray, Utah. It offers technology-driven solutions for the financial performance and patient experience of health systems, hospitals, and physician groups.\n\nOn April 10, an Overweight rating and $20 price target were reiterated on R1 RCM Inc. (NASDAQ:RCM) by Cantor Fitzgerald analysts.\n\nThere were 30 hedge funds long R1 RCM Inc. (NASDAQ:RCM) in the fourth quarter, with a total stake value of $558.3 million.\n\nVoss Capital, LLC said the following about R1 RCM Inc. (NASDAQ:RCM) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cR1 RCM Inc. (NASDAQ:RCM) is a top player in outsourced Revenue Cycle Management for large hospitals and physician groups. Outsourced revenue cycle management is still in the early innings with only about 30% penetration, and we believe R1 has the most complete and scalable independent (i.e., not affiliated with an insurance company) solution in the marketplace, in what could prove to be a \u201cwinner take most\u201d industry. With hospital profitability under pressure and coding and regulatory complexity ever increasing, R1 offers substantial savings via regional labor arbitrage and automation technology to customers through more efficient revenue collection.\n\nThe current management team came from Cloudmed, which R1 acquired very recently in June of 2022, and has undertaken the challenging task of cultural and technological integration while being relative public market newcomers under immense scrutiny. Cloudmed offers modular or single-point RCM solutions as opposed to a full end-to-end offering, and it counts 95 out of the top 100 hospitals in the US as customers. Cloudmed is a solid business with upwards of 40% EBITDA margins and 117% net revenue retention, and we think they can achieve a mid-teens revenue CAGR over the next few years while opening the door to upselling R1\u2019s more robust service offering across the broader customer base\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nLike Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), R1 RCM Inc. (NASDAQ:RCM) is among the best healthcare stocks to buy now.\n\n9. Bausch Health Companies (NYSE:BHC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 31\n\nShare Price: $8.9\n\nA Sector Perform rating and $12 price target were maintained on Bausch Health Companies (NYSE:BHC) by RBC Capital analysts on April 12.\n\nBausch Health Companies (NYSE:BHC) is a pharmaceutical company based in Laval, Canada, and is among the best healthcare stocks to buy. It develops, manufactures, and markets products in the gastroenterology, hepatology, neurology, dermatology, and eye health areas, among more.\n\nOur hedge fund data for the fourth quarter shows 31 hedge funds long Bausch Health Companies (NYSE:BHC), with a total stake value of $1.1 billion.\n\nGoldenTree Asset Management was the most prominent shareholder in Bausch Health Companies (NYSE:BHC) at the end of the fourth quarter, holding 27.6 million shares in the company.\n\n8. Oscar Health, Inc. (NYSE:OSCR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 31\n\nShare Price: $14.9\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, Deerfield Management was the largest shareholder in Oscar Health, Inc. (NYSE:OSCR), holding 11.2 million shares in the company.\n\nOscar Health, Inc. (NYSE:OSCR) is a life and health insurance company based in New York. It offers health plans in individual and small-group markets.\n\nAn Outperform rating and $20 price target were placed on Oscar Health, Inc. (NYSE:OSCR) on March 22 by Raymond James analysts.\n\nOscar Health, Inc. (NYSE:OSCR) was seen in the 13F holdings of 31 hedge funds in the fourth quarter, with a total stake value of $439.8 million.\n\nLongleaf Partners mentioned Oscar Health, Inc. (NYSE:OSCR) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOscar Health, Inc. (NYSE:OSCR) \u2013 Health insurance and software platform Oscar Health was the top contributor in the fourth quarter and for the year, after the stock price appreciated over 270% in 2023. Oscar was a top detractor in 2022 and highlights the importance of pragmatically revisiting the case for our decliners and not panic selling or adding too early on price declines. It is also a good reminder that game-changing value creation can come in unexpected ways, as it did with Mark Bertolini joining as CEO at Oscar this year. We couldn\u2019t have modeled this as a driver, but we did recognize the stock price had become unduly punished alongside most tech-related businesses in 2022 and had confidence the business would rebound strongly. We remained engaged with management and the board to encourage proactive steps to close the extreme value gap. Oscar did benefit from a general rally in tech businesses coming out of 2022 weakness, but the positive price movement was primarily a direct reflection on the management upgrade and operational execution. Mark Bertolini brings significant operational expertise, as well as a strong endorsement value to the business, given his long-term track record as CEO of Aetna, which he sold to CVS for a great outcome for Aetna shareholders. Bertolini\u2019s compensation package aligns his interests with shareholders, and he only really starts getting paid when the stock trades at $11 (vs the still discounted ~$9 level where the stock ended the year). In his first year, he has in quick order improved cost control and operational efficiency that drove EBITDA strength. Oscar reported another great quarter in November, beating expectations across most metrics and increasing 2024 guidance. The original venture investor holders beyond Thrive remain an overhang on the share price, and Oscar still offers significant upside from here.\u201d\n\n7. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 31\n\nShare Price: $17.8\n\nIn the fourth quarter, 31 hedge funds were long Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), with a total stake value of $687.8 million.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is a drug retail company on our list of the best healthcare stocks to buy. It operates and offers retail drugstores, health and wellness services, and home delivery pharmacy services, among more.\n\nAs of April 3, TD Cowen analysts hold a Buy rating and $35 price target on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA).\n\nSessa Capital was the largest shareholder in Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) at the end of the fourth quarter, holding 3.8 million shares in the company.\n\n6. Envista Holdings Corporation (NYSE:NVST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 33\n\nShare Price: $19.2\n\nEnvista Holdings Corporation (NYSE:NVST) is a healthcare equipment company based in Brea, California. It develops dental products such as dental implant systems, guided surgery systems, biomaterials, and more.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, 33 hedge funds held stakes in Envista Holdings Corporation (NYSE:NVST), with a total stake value of $565.9 million.\n\nJefferies analysts maintain a Hold rating and $23 price target on Envista Holdings Corporation (NYSE:NVST) as of February 9.\n\nHere's what TimesSquare Capital Management said about Envista Holdings Corporation (NYSE:NVST) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOur preference within Health Care is for novel therapies to address unmet medical needs, specialized providers, and innovators.\u00a0Envista Holdings Corporation (NYSE:NVST) develops and manufactures dental products. We exited the position on the combination of disappointing third quarter results and lowered forward guidance. They reported softness in adult orthodontics and high-end implants. Envista\u2019s stock sold off by -19% while held during the quarter.\u201d\n\nLike Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), Envista Holdings Corporation (NYSE:NVST) is among the best healthcare stocks to invest in today.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy Under $20.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Micro-Cap Healthcare Stocks Insiders Are Buying Jim Cramer\u2019s 10 Favorite Healthcare Stock Picks in 2024 Insiders are Piling into These 10 Healthcare Stocks in 2024\n\nDisclosure: None. 10 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy Under $20 is originally published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this largest U.S. drugstore chain have returned -14.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, which Walgreens falls in, has lost 12%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Walgreens is expected to post earnings of $0.71 per share, indicating a change of -29% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -19.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.23 points to a change of -18.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.13 indicates a change of -3.1% from what Walgreens is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -10.7%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Walgreens is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Walgreens, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $36.02 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $145.98 billion and $151.45 billion estimates indicate +5% and +3.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nWalgreens reported revenues of $37.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.3%. EPS of $1.20 for the same period compares with $1.16 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.22 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.29%. The EPS surprise was +46.34%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Walgreens surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nWalgreens is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walgreens. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Seven stocks stand out due to their strategic placement and excellent growth prospects among many investing alternatives. With careful post-merger integration, the first one has improved operating efficiency and produced significant savings, setting it up for future success. The second one keeps growing, leveraging the development of the digital payments industry and securing its sources of income. The third one\u2019s large user base on all of its platforms highlights how effective its monetization and advertising techniques are.\n\nThe semiconductor industry\u2019s technological achievements and durability in the fourth one indicate sustained development despite market volatility. The fifth one maintains its position as a top provider thanks to its strategic approach to broadband connections, which uses fixed and wireless technology. The sixth demonstrates flexibility and development potential through diversification initiatives and success in new areas.\n\nLastly, the seventh operational accomplishment highlights its dedication to strategic efforts, especially in the healthcare sector. This results in favorable financial consequences. Read more to learn about the fundamentals behind its rapid value growth potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) A close-up of the blue and yellow Warner Bros (WBD) sign.\n\nSource: Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs of 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) has executed its post-merger integration. It saves $4 billion between merger and transformation costs, demonstrating its dedication to cost reduction and operational effectiveness.\n\nFurthermore, the integration initiatives make the company more flexible and streamlined. This has allowed Warner Bros. Discovery to realize further economies in production flow and enterprise systems, which helps to increase cash flow generation and profitability.\n\nFurther, Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s direct-to-consumer (D2C) sector has nearly\u00a098 million members (Q4 2023). This indicates tremendous growth potential. The company is still focused on growing its direct-to-consumer (D2C) product line. Moreover, the company plans to introduce Max to important foreign markets, including Europe and Latin America.\n\nOverall, the D2C segment has the potential for profitability and contribution to overall performance. Hence, this is reflected in the company\u2019s positive EBITDA of\u00a0almost $100 million.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q4 2023 and 2023, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) delivered constant top-line growth. The company has the fundamental capacity to seize a higher portion of the digital payments industry. Revenue climbed by 9% in Q4 and by 8% in 2023. Additionally, PayPal attained a revenue boost on both a spot and a neutral foreign exchange basis. This signifies its adaptability to a range of market situations.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, PayPal\u2019s total payment volume (TPV) was\u00a0$409.8 billion in Q4 and $1.53 trillion in 2023. This was boosted by 15% in Q4 and 13% in 2023 on a spot basis. It is a core factor deriving the company\u2019s top-line growth. The steady increase in TPV reflects PayPal\u2019s capacity to handle rising transaction volumes, which reflects the company\u2019s growing user base and strengthening relationships with current clients.\n\nFinally, alongside the focus on cost control, there is a sharp effort to make strategic investments in high-growth sectors like\u00a0Braintree, branded checkout, and other value-added services. Thus, by making these investments, PayPal may improve its competitive edge while preserving an efficient balance between expense reduction and top-line growth.\n\nMeta (META) A woman holds Apple iPhone X with Instagram application on the screen at cafe.

META stock, Instagram layoffs\n\nSource: wichayada suwanachun / Shutterstock.com\n\nFacebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and other applications in Meta\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) family of apps have billions of users. Moreover, Meta\u2019s family of Daily Active People (DAP) grew 8% over 2022 to 3.19 billion in 2023. Similarly, the family of Monthly Active People (MAP) increased to 3.98 billion. This indicates 6% annual growth, reflecting Meta\u2019s capacity to draw and hold users across all its platforms.\n\nAbout Facebook, in particular, the platform\u2019s daily active users (DAUs) averaged\u00a02.11 billion in 2023. This is a 6% rise over 2022. In addition, as of 2023, Facebook\u2019s Monthly Active Users (MAUs) had grown by 3%, demonstrating Facebook\u2019s enduring popularity and massive user engagement.\n\nTo conclude, Meta\u2019s secret to success is its capacity to maintain a large and continuously expanding user base on all its platforms. Hence, this broad audience base offers a solid basis for generating revenue from advertising and other\u00a0forms of monetization.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith sales of over $15 billion in Q4 2023, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) holds solid top-line growth. There is a considerable boost of 10% over Q4 2022, indicating the business\u2019s ability to seize market opportunities and satisfy client demand. Intel has demonstrated its endurance and competitiveness in the semiconductor sector by generating double-digit sales growth.\n\nAdditionally, Intel still has space for potential growth; even if it forecasts the revenue to fall modestly in Q1 2024, the company projects it at $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion. Even with the range of revenues below the 2023 Q4, Intel remains optimistic, with some guidance pointing towards the underlying strength in the main business divisions.\n\nTo sum up, Intel 3\u2019s release reflects its technical development, the first advanced node available to Intel Foundry Services (IFS) clients. Finally, Intel\u2019s focus on tackling the problems of semiconductor innovation is demonstrated by the installation in Oregon of the first on-site high-NA EUV tool in the industry.\n\nVerizon (VZ) Verizon Retail Location.

VZ stock\n\nSource: RAMAN SHAUNIA / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver 1.7 million new internet customers were added to Verizon\u2019s (NYSE:VZ) broadband business in 2023. This demonstrates the company\u2019s solid growth in net addition. Fios customers and fixed wireless access drove this rise, demonstrating the high demand for broadband connection options.\n\nWith more than\u00a01.5 million net additions to Verizon\u2019s broadband network during the year, fixed wireless access emerged as a major driver of net additions. This expansion exceeded projections and proved Verizon\u2019s plan to use wireless technologies to increase internet coverage to be more effective.\n\nMoreover, Verizon\u2019s Fios Internet net additions increased, reaching 248K for the year. Although this was a slight gain over the prior year, it demonstrated Verizon\u2019s ability to draw new customers and keep existing ones for its conventional fiber-based internet services.\n\nLastly, the steady increase in broadband net additions shows Verizon\u2019s ability to take advantage of the growing demand in urban and rural regions for high-speed internet services.\n\nPhilip Morris (PM) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nThe growth potential of Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) has been bolstered by its strategy of broadening its product line and venturing into new areas. The Q4 2023 off-take share data across several geographies indicates that Philip Morris saw excellent growth in low- and middle-income economies. Countries with dynamic off-take volume growth included Egypt, Morocco, Indonesia, and others.\n\nAdditionally, with over 8.5 million adult users, the IQOS brand propelled development in the heat-not-burn sector in places like Japan. The category\u2019s proportion of the Japanese industry grew to about 40%, demonstrating how well-accepted smokeless alternatives are.\n\nMoreover, the nicotine pouch product ZYN by Philip Morris had remarkable growth in the United States in Q4 of 2023, with volumes rising by more than 75%. Its growing retail value share reflects the product\u2019s premium positioning and excellent brand equity.\n\nFinally, Philip Morris\u2019 expansion was greatly aided by the acquisition of Swedish Match; pro forma net revenues increased by 20% in 2023 and 26% in Q4 of 2023. ZYN\u2019s exceptional performance in the U.S. further enhanced Philip Morris\u2019s income streams and market presence.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior.

The U.S. Healthcare division reached a major milestone by producing its first-ever positive adjusted EBITDA quarter. The purchase of Summit Health was the primary factor in the segment\u2019s\u00a033% revenue boost\u00a0during Q2 2024.\n\nIn addition, the segment\u2019s\u00a0$127 million increase in adjusted EBITDA over the prior year demonstrates the success of strategic efforts meant to improve profitability and operational efficiency.\n\nMoreover, the international division of Walgreens Boots Alliance showed steady performance and execution. There is solid retail comp growth at Boots UK and steady market share increases. Despite slower real estate gains, the\u00a0segment\u2019s 3.2% sales increase and stable adjusted operating income demonstrate its tenacity and skill at overcoming obstacles in the market.\n\nTo sum up, the international segment\u2019s sustained performance highlights Walgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s robust worldwide reach and its capacity to use local market knowledge to spur expansion and profitability.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in WBD, PYPL, META, INTC, VZ, PM and WBA.

        "content": "NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 16, 2024 / The issue of packaging waste continues to be a concern for our industry. At Walgreens Boots Alliance, we are doing what we can to help address the negative impacts packaging waste has on the environment. We have made substantial strides around reducing single-use plastic components in our packaging and have switched to alternatives, where feasible. Our efforts to make packaging more sustainable span product design, industry collaborations, customer education, improved supplier data collection and more.\n\nMeasuring Our Progress\n\nWBA's owned brands continued to make progress against our targets throughout fiscal 2023. Through the implementation and execution of our tools and programs, we engaged with more suppliers and are increasingly proactive in reducing our impact through our sourcing practices.\n\nNotable efforts and achievements include:\n\nBoots and No7 Beauty Company brands have expanded the number of products across categories produced from recycled content, recyclable or natural materials, including reusable makeup remover pads, cleansing pads, reusable baby wipes, lipsticks and compacts as well as eyewear brand, Botaniq. To support National Recycling Week (Oct. 17 - 23) in the UK, Boots ran an awareness campaign on the low recycling rates for bathroom (50 percent) versus kitchen (90 percent) products and shared take-home recycling kits and leaflets with tips along with other amplification tactics to maximize the campaign's effectiveness and staying power.\n\nProduct Labeling\n\nWBA supplier agreements specify that suppliers must meet regulatory requirements for labeling of ingredients on our owned brand products. Under the minimum standard requirements, new and refreshed WBA-owned brand items must be reviewed to carry a How2Recycle\u2122 label for U.S. products or an On-Pack Recycling Label (OPRL) for UK products. We work with the Sustainable Packaging Coalition on implementing the How2Recycle label on an increasing number of our products. These labels are designed to provide customers with clear advice on how to recycle. In the UK, WBA has representation on the OPRL technical advisory committee, working on industry-wide solutions involving recycling labeling. Through our Minimum Sustainability Requirements and Labeling standards, Boots and No7 Beauty Company have mandated the use of \"Do Not Flush\" labeling on products which have the highest risk of being inappropriately flushed.\n\nFor more information on WBA's sustainability initiatives please see the latest Environmental, Social & Governance Report.\n\nStory continues\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Walgreens Boots Alliance on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\r\nSpokesperson: Walgreens Boots Alliance\r\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/walgreens-boots-alliance\r\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In a setting historically dominated by male leadership, women at the helm of major corporations is still considered something of a novelty. You don\u2019t see many articles about a company\u2019s first male CEO, but there\u2019s always a buzz when the first woman gets hired to the same position.\n\nAs of January 2023 only 10% of the Fortune 500 companies were run by a woman. That\u2019s surprising considering a study conducted by S&P Global found that in the two years following their appointment, \u201cfemale CEOs saw a 20% increase in stock price momentum.\u201d Companies with more gender diversity on their board of directors are also more profitable.\n\nInvestors may not specifically consider stocks with women CEOs when looking at here to invest. However, the women on this list and the companies they represent are great examples of how female leadership can turn a company around or help it continue to thrive in an otherwise tumultuous market. Their different upbringings and paths to business bring a unique perspective that can change the outlook of a company.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logo\n\nSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.com\n\nMary Barra has been the CEO of General Motors (NYSE:GM) since January 2014. She is the first female CEO of the \u201cBig Three\u201d automakers that includes Ford (NYSE:F) and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA). She is currently the only female CEO in the U.S. auto industry.\n\nYear-to-date (YTD), GM stock is up 23.51%. According to Tip Ranks, it has the best price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of all its competitors at 6.04. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), currently struggling, stands at 38.32. GM has a 15.69% upside with an average price target of $51.17. Based on 19 ratings, analysts consider GM a moderate buy, but Barra has a history of navigating GM through some of its toughest challenges. The future of the company looks bright under her continued leadership.\n\nIn her time as CEO, Barra has spearheaded the process of modernizing General Motors, focusing on the development of electric vehicles (EVs) and improving customer experience. She has also championed the cause of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), which many business executives believe is important for positive business growth. Thanks to her efforts and successes, she was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2023.\n\nThe average tenure of a Fortune 500 CEO is 7.2 years for men and 4.5 years for women. Clearly Barra is doing something right. Not only has she doubled the time in her position as the average female CEO but outperformed her male counterparts as well. Her length of time in the job must mean she\u2019s doing something right. As the auto industry continues to face challenges, Barra\u2019s strong leadership at GM make it not just one of the great stocks with women CEOs, but also a great choice for automotive stocks as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nCVS Health (CVS) the storefront of a CVS pharmacy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nKaren Lynch has been CEO of CVSHealth (NYSE:CVS) since February 2021. While she\u2019s only been at the company a short time, she has made waves with her new approach to the healthcare industry. Part of her grand plan for CVS is to create better health outcomes in the community, including a focus on how the company addresses Medicare as the ever-increasing senior population turns 65.\n\nWith a current average price target of $87.88, CVS stock has a 17.83% upside. While YTD it\u2019s down 8%, it\u2019s doing considerably better than rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), which is down 28% in the same time frame. Walgreens is not doing well right now, while CVS\u2019 performance in 2023 points toward a much healthier future. Recently, the quarterly dividend for CVS was increased by 10%, indicating confidence in the company\u2019s financial future.\n\nLynch recently published \u201cTaking Up Space: Get Heard, Deliver Results, and Make a Difference.\u201d In it, she chronicles her rise to becoming CEO of the sixth-largest Fortune 500 company. Her barrier-breaking attitude towards life is mirrored in her approach to business, and that bodes well for CVS.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nLisa Su has been the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) since October 2014. Like Barra, Su has held her position as CEO longer than most others on the Fortune 500 list. She has also led the company through one of the greatest recent turnarounds in the technology sector.\n\nIf you invested $10,000 at the time Su became CEO, you\u2019d have over $430,000 today. The company was on the edge of bankruptcy when she took over. Her vision, though, led the company to shed its investments in unnecessary divisions. Instead, she honed in on its money-makers: high-performance central and graphics processing units (CPUs and GPUs).\n\nWhile Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) seems to be every investor\u2019s favorite tech stock darling right now, AMD is a solid competitor. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is actually a first cousin once removed of Su, so they\u2019ve kept their success in the family. Despite concerns that both AMD and Nvidia are overvalued, some think AMD is still a good buy. According to TipRanks, there\u2019s still a potential 18.56% upside in comparison to NVDA\u2019s 12.65%. Su\u2019s unique perspective as a female leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) and technology sector might just provide the edge the company needs to outperform its industry sibling.\n\nOn the date of publication, Philippa Main\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nPhilippa Main is a real estate agent in Virginia and Florida who also does freelance writing, editing, and business development and marketing.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the10 Underperforming Stocks Insiders are Buying. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Underperforming Stocks Insiders are Buying.\n\nLegendary investor Peter Lynch in his famous book \u201cOne Up On Wall Street\u201d talked in detail about the importance of keeping tabs on insider buying and why insiders buy or sell their company shares. In this book Lynch wrote something that became one of the most popular quotes in circles tracking corporate insider buying and selling:\n\n\u201cThere are many reasons that officers might sell. They may need the money to pay their children\u2019s tuition or to buy a new house or to satisfy a debt. They may have decided to diversify into other stocks. But there\u2019s only one reason that insiders buy: They think the stock price is undervalued and will eventually go up.\u201d\n\nImportance of Paying Attention to Insider Buying: Lessons from Peter Lynch\n\nBut there\u2019s much more to this book than just this quote. Lynch said that when you are tracking insider buying activity, you should pay more attention to corporate officers from \u201clower echelons\u201d of companies buying shares. That\u2019s because a when a CEO or President who already earns millions in salary and benefits buys some of his company shares, that does not mean much when compared to a corporate officer with $45,000 salary buying $10,000 worth of stock.\n\nLynch said when insiders are buying like \u201ccrazy\u201d you can be certain, \u201cat a minimum,\u201d that the company will not go bankrupt in the next six months. Mostly importantly, according to Lynch, when a stock falls after significant insider buying, you should take this as a buying opportunity and understand that you are able to buy the stock cheaper than the company insiders did.\n\nDon't Miss: Insiders are Selling These Overvalued Stocks Insiders are Piling into These Healthcare Stocks in 2024\n\nIs There Any Link Between Insider Buying/Selling and Stock Returns?\n\nThere have been several academic papers published establishing the link between insider buying/selling and stock returns. More often than not researchers were able to conclusively deduce from their findings that when a stock is seeing massive insider buying, it\u2019s a positive sign. A research report by Catalyst Capital Advisors takes a look at such academic studies and says that researchers at Wharton, Harvard, University of Michigan, and University of Chicago found that investing strategies based on insider buying beat the broader market over longer periods of time. The report also said that technical back testing using insider buying data from 2003 to 2010 confirmed that an investing strategy mimicking insider buys outperformed the market by significant markets. The research paper also established that when analyzing insider buying activity, paying attention to insider roles matters.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cReturns can be maximized by evaluating the type of insider purchasing shares. Investing based on top executive cluster buying generates a 200 basis point improvement over a general insider buying strategy while outperforming the market (S&P 500 index) by greater than 11%.\u201d\n\nInsider Monkey's research also provides an importance insight into the usefulness of tracking insider activity. \u00a0Insider Monkey\u2019s monthly newsletter and\u00a0portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs\u2019 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points. Underperforming Stocks Insiders are Buying\n\nPhoto by Mohamed Hadji on Unsplash\n\nCluster Buying\n\nAnother important angle in insider buying is cluster buying, where a stock is bought by a large group of directors and officers at the same time.\n\n\u201cInvesting based on top executive cluster buying generates a 200 basis point improvement over a general insider buying strategy while outperforming the market (S&P 500 index) by greater than 11% Grouping firms with top executive buying by the number of shares traded during the month demonstrates that returns are maximized as trade volume increases. Firms with top executive insider buying and trade volumes greater than 10,000 shares during that month outperform the by greater than 25%, on average.\u201d\n\nInsider Buying Activity After Earnings: Making Use of Market Reaction\n\nInvestors usually think insiders, by virtue of their positions at their companies, have the foreknowledge of events and they buy and sell stocks based on this factor only. But an interesting study conducted in 2020 showed that insiders often buy and sell shares after market reactions following earnings reports. Stocks usually react positively or negatively after earnings, and insiders assess this reaction and buy and sell shares accordingly. The research used insider trading transactions data in the US from 2003 until 2016. As we are about the enter the Q1\u20192024 earnings season, it\u2019s important to keep track of insider buying and selling activity of companies immediately after their earnings reports.\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify stocks which are down about 10% or more year to date and saw insider buying activity over the past couple of weeks. From these stocks we picked companies with the highest insider buying activity in terms of dollar value. Top names in the list include Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA), Gray Television, Inc (NYSE:GTN) and Clearway Energy Inc Class C (NYSE:CWEN).\n\n10.

        "title": "Dividend Danger Zone: 3 Aristocrats on the Brink of a Payout Cut",
        "content": "Dividend Aristocrats are stocks that are members of the S&P 500 index and have raised their dividend payouts yearly for 25 years or more. It\u2019s an exclusive list of companies. Of the thousands of stocks on the market, only 68 were cut.\n\nThat shows just how difficult it is. Yet, becoming a Dividend Aristocrat doesn\u2019t mean a stock will always be one. Earlier this year, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) was forced to cut its dividend to conserve cash. Before that, VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) slashed its payout by 70%. Both stocks were booted from the list.\n\nBelow are three Dividend Aristocrats to avoid. They pose the greatest risk of cutting their dividend. Although they might not, as companies go to great lengths to maintain their status, a close inspection shows why these stocks are in danger of doing so.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nSome investors might be surprised to learn that lithium producer Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is a dividend aristocrat, let alone that it is one to avoid because it might cut its payout. The company owns one of the largest lithium mines at Greenbushes in Perth, Australia.\n\nAlbemarle was added to the Dividend Aristocrat list in 2019 and continues raising its payout to this day. Yet, being royalty doesn\u2019t necessarily tell you the quality of the dividend. Although ALB stock is approaching its 30th year of increases, the growth rate has slowed dramatically. Over the past decade, Albemarle\u2019s dividend has grown at a compounded annual rate of 3.8%, but over the last five years, it has grown to just 1.7% annually. That means investors are earning less on their dividends due to inflation.\n\nWorse for ALB stock investors, the company typically generates negative free cash flow (FCF). Because companies pay their dividends out of the money they have left over after paying their bills, Albemarle\u2019s negative 23% FCF payout ratio is a yellow flag.\n\nAgain, the lithium producer may not cut its payout tomorrow, but that\u2019s not a good sign. There are much better places for your money than Albermarle stock.\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf there\u2019s one Dividend Aristocrat most seen as likely to cut its payout, it\u2019s industrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM). Because of the legal liabilities piled up against the owner of Post-It Notes and Scotch brand tape, it makes more sense to cut the dividend than use its cash reserves to finance it.\n\n3M has paid a dividend for 66 years. So, not only is it an aristocrat, but it\u2019s also a dividend king, meaning the payout has been raised for 50 years or more. Still, the company faces billions in legal liabilities for its military earplugs and more than $10 billion for environmental pollution from so-called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d to be paid out over the next decade or so.\n\nStory continues\n\n3M also just spun off its one growth business, the healthcare business Solventum (NYSE:SOLV). Many companies cut their dividends after such spinoffs. AT&T (NYSE:T) cut its dividend in half when it spun off its entertainment division into Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD).\n\nAlthough 3M\u2019s FCF payout ratio is only 65%, much of those cash flows will go to Solventum. The conglomerate still owns almost 20% of the company, which means it will have much less FCF coming in. Management has committed to paying a dividend but hasn\u2019t given a full-throated defense of increasing it.\n\nLeggett & Platt (LEG) A magnifying glass is focused on the logo for Leggett & Platt on the company's website.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nInner coil spring maker Leggett & Platt (NYSE:LEG) is the third Dividend Aristocrat to avoid. The mattress spring maker has been in business for 140 years and has raised its dividend for over 50 years. However, it\u2019s business has been ailing. Inflation and high interest rates have hurt its primary business, which relies on the housing market. They also impact secondary ones like automotive and flooring. Those three industries account for 80% of Leggett & Platt\u2019s revenue.\n\nThe stock is down 26% this year and off 37% over the past 12 months. The Federal Reserve is growing increasingly reticent about cutting interest rates, which could weigh further on Leggett\u2019s fortunes.\n\nLEG stock is currently the highest-yielding Dividend Aristocrat, and though its FCF payout ratio is 65%, it is near to maxing out the leverage ratio set by its debt covenants. It may need to divert more resources to preserve its investment-grade debt rating, which hints at a possible dividend cut coming.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in WBA, MMM, SOLV, WBD, T and LEG stock.

        "title": "5 Stocks to Buy as Interest Rates Begin to Fall",
        "content": "In February, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon unloaded $150 million of his company\u2019s stock \u2013 his first-ever sale. Shares of the bank had risen 70% since 2022, and valuations were beginning to look rich.\n\nHe\u2019s not the only one who seems worried. Last month, Morningstar analyst Sarah Hansen noted that banks no longer traded at a relative discount, calling them \u201cnot a sector-wide play,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek way of saying \u201cthis sector stinks.\u201d\n\nEssentially, that\u2019s because interest rates are set to fall, which harms a bank\u2019s ability to earn money. Lenders generate profits from the spread between borrowing and lending rates, and low interest rates squeeze the gap between the two figures since deposit rates cannot fall far below 0%. (Going negative would require customers to pay banks to hold deposits!) Analysts expect JPMorgan itself to see a 3% decline in net income this year as the Federal Reserve begins its rate cuts later this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeanwhile, the winners of falling interest rates are the indebted firms that suddenly find it cheaper to borrow money and refinance. Crushing debts become repayable, and previously insolvent firms (or those teetering on the edge) start generating cash once more.\n\nMany investors will dislike this volatility \u2013 and the presidential election adds more on top of it. It\u2019s one reason why gold is now reaching all-time highs. And it\u2019s why Louis Navellier is talking to a special guest this week about how to navigate these chaotic times. But those with higher risk tolerances will find plenty of opportunities where falling interest rates will increase demand and flip negative profits to positive \u2013 both historically bullish signs for share prices. The writers at InvestorPlace.com \u2013 our free news and analysis site \u2013 explore five of these companies this week.\n\n5 Stocks to Buy: Walgreens (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough run for shareholders of Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), America\u2019s largest pharmacy chain. The stock has lost 75% of its value since 2016 and generated $5.4 billion in reported pretax losses in fiscal 2023. Analysts expect the firm to notch another $1.1 billion in pretax losses through August, driven by weak profit margins and $500 million of interest expenses.\n\nMuch of Walgreens\u2019 problems stem from its debts. In 2018, the firm spent $4.4 billion in cash to buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores. Management then used an additional $4.8 billion in 2023 to buy Summit, a provider of primary, specialty, and urgent care. The combined entity now has $1.1 billion in debts maturing this year, and another $2.2 billion in 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat means falling interest rates could hardly come at a better time. Debt maturities over the next three years represent 40% of Walgreen\u2019s total liabilities, and the firm generates too little cash flow to extinguish these debts. It will either need to refinance them or sell off certain equity investments to make up the difference.\n\nBusiness is also improving. As Joel Baglole noted in an InvestorPlace.com update this week:\n\nWhile things look dark for Walgreens, there are some faint glimmers of light starting to shine on the company and its stock. The company has a new CEO named Tim Wentworth who took the helm in October of last year. He has already undertaken a turnaround plan that included cutting the dividend to strengthen the company\u2019s balance sheet and preserve cash.\n\nAdditionally, Walgreens\u2019 most recent earnings beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines. The strong print was a reversal for Walgreens, which had missed earnings estimates in the two previous quarters. It will take time, but WBA stock could come back.\n\nTogether, that means Walgreens could cut its debt in half by 2026 and generate as much as $2.43 reported earnings per share. Regular earnings per share \u2013 which removes one-time charges \u2013 could be as high as $3.53. If that happens, a three-stage discounted cash flow model (DCF) tells us Walgreens is worth $60, a stunning 215% upside from today.\n\nSabre (SABR) The logo for Sabre Corporation (SABR) is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn February, InvestorPlace.com writer Thomas Niel noted that several Wall Street analysts had suddenly turned positive on Sabre (NASDAQ:SABR), a legacy provider of back-end technology services to the travel sector.\n\nIn its bullish rating, Cantor Fitzgerald cites the strong potential for significant cost savings starting in 2025, new product launches, and the plowing of the resultant increased cash flow into debt reduction efforts all as factors that could send SABR flying high again.\n\nMuch like Walgreens, Sabre carries extremely high debts. Its former private equity owners believed its stable business could withstand high interest payments, and so they loaded up the company with almost $4 billion in debts \u2013 an enormous sum for a company generating just $500 million in annual operating profits.\n\nThe 2020 pandemic proved disastrous for this strategy. A sudden decline in air travel cut Sabre\u2019s revenues by 66% in 2020, sending operating income from $363 million to negative $1 billion. The rise in interest rates in 2022 then blunted the ensuing recovery in travel. In 2023, 90% of Sabre\u2019s $494 million pretax loss came from interest payments.\n\nFortunately, 2024 is shaping to be a year where both headwinds will turn into tailwinds. Air travel is set to exceed pre-pandemic levels, just as the cost of debt is set to fall. Analysts believe Sabre will eke out positive net income as soon as Q3 this year, and for consistent profits to begin by 2025.\n\nRoyal Caribbean (RCL) and Carnival (CCL) cruise stocks docked cruise ships. CCL stock.\n\nSource: Kokoulina / Shutterstock.com\n\nIan Cooper writes about Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) and Carnival (NYSE:CCL) this week at InvestorPlace.com, highlighting that travelers have been booking cruises for 2024 at greater volumes than before 2019. About 35.7 million consumers are expected to cruise this year alone, up from 31.5 million in 2023.\n\nThat will greatly benefit the two cruise firms, which, like the two previous picks, carry significant financial debts. Vessels are typically bought on mortgages, and the cruise liners spent roughly half of their operating incomes on debt service last year. That means small changes in revenues can enormously impact the bottom line.\n\nRising demand and falling interest rates now provide a path to rapid growth. Analysts expect Royal Caribbean\u2019s earnings to surge 48% this year, and for Carnival\u2019s to rise from $0 to $1.3 billion. Both companies should earn double-digit returns on capital invested (ROICs) by 2026.\n\nThe recent collapse of Baltimore\u2019s Francis Scott Key Bridge provides a final catalyst for both firms. Shares in both cruise firms temporarily dipped on the media hype, even though the event will have no material impact on their business. Cooper writes:\n\nAfter rallying from a 2022 low of $6.15 to a recent high of $15.14, [Carnival] is pulling back after failing at double-top resistance. Plus, it did warn that the Baltimore bridge collapse would cut into its profits by about $10 million. Still, CCL is an attractive bet with the overall industry sailing higher.\n\nTo put that into perspective, Carnival\u2019s 11% decline since the bridge incident on March 26 wiped out $2.2 billion in market capitalization.\n\nOpendoor (OPEN) The Opendoor website is open on a smartphone that is resting on top of a map. Opendoor stock.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, Matthew Farley writes this week at InvestorPlace.com about Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ:OPEN), an \u201ci-buying\u201d firm that makes cash offers for houses and flips them to prospective buyers. He notes that Opendoor has seen substantial gains in 2023 and is now expected to achieve breakeven free cash flow by the first half of 2024.\n\nFor 2024, OPEN has set a revenue target between $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion for Q1, with a contribution profit expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. This outlook implies a contribution margin of 3.8% to 4.5%, with an adjusted EBITDA loss projected between $70 million and $80 million.\n\nThomas Niel also notes at InvestorPlace.com that Opendoor\u2019s stock has been bouncing back with a vengeance from \u201crate cut mania.\u201d The firm carries $2.5 billion in long-term debts to help fund its purchases, so declining interest rates not only boost demand for houses (because cheaper mortgages make housing more affordable for would-be buyers). It cuts expenses for Opendoor as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the firm won\u2019t be profitable until at least 2027. Analysts expect mortgage rates to remain above 5% for the next several years, which will create a drag on housing demand. Opendoor\u2019s weak cash flows also reduce its ability to repay debts early, which will prolong the time it takes to become profitable.\n\nStill, declining interest rates are pointing the real estate i-buyer in the right direction. Operating earnings (which ignore interest payments) could turn positive within two years, and the company\u2019s leveraged business model means shares have enormous upside if business recovers.\n\nThe Investor\u2019s Guide to the Age of Chaos\n\nThe five companies here are what you might call \u201croller-coaster\u201d firms\u2026 formerly unprofitable businesses where investors are banking on a recovery. Shares will either rise 5X or more\u2026 or go to zero. A single misstep by the Fed could spell chaos for these picks.\n\nIn Louis\u2019 latest presentation, he notes that this chaos could easily spread, especially with the presidential election happening concurrently.\n\nThat\u2019s why you should join him and a special guest for the Election Shock Summit on Wednesday, April 10, at 8 p.m. During that event, they\u2019ll share their thoughts on the Fed\u2019s rate cut schedule (they disagree), the election, what to do with your money now, and much more.

        "content": "NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 9, 2024 / The failure to take medications as prescribed is associated with adverse health outcomes and rising healthcare costs. Walgreens Boots Alliance strives to improve medication adherence by addressing systemic barriers to care. Barriers can include everything from a misunderstanding of prescription interactions with other drugs to a lack of access to transportation. Lack of insurance, financial insecurity, inconvenience and forgetfulness are also commonly identified as factors in adherence failure. You can learn more about how WBA is overcoming barriers to medication adherence in our 2023 Environmental, Social and Governance Report.\n\nOur pharmacists and healthcare providers take the extra step to help ensure adherence among their patients. Analytics help us predict the patients most likely to become non-adherent and identify custom ways to reach them and help them maintain their regimen. Adherence programs for the most complex treatments and disease-state management programs include phone, virtual and in-person consultations to address potential side effects and offer remedies, digital solutions including medication synchronization, delivery, consultations and patient education and efforts to connect patients to financial assistance to help them stay on track.\n\nOur pharmacists are continuously learning and updating their training on common chronic conditions including hyperlipidemia and diabetes management. Recognizing that diabetes, high cholesterol and hypertension are prevalent among Americans, we tailored specific programs to help improve outcomes for patients living with these disease states. Across these conditions, Walgreens PDC (Proportion of Days Covered) rates improved by 0.3% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. PDC is a common measurement for adherence referring to the percentage of time a patient has medication available based on refill records.\n\nMedication non-adherence remains a significant barrier to positive health outcomes for those with mental health conditions. To help support greater adherence, outcomes, and lower overall costs for patients and payers, Walgreens has added oncolytics, estrogen hormones, antiandrogens and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices to its New to Therapy pharmacy program in addition to anti-anxiety medication, anti-psychotics and anti-depressants.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalgreens works to improve medication adherence, manage chronic disease and overcome barriers to care through numerous programs, which you can learn more about in our 2023 Environmental, Social and Governance Report.\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Walgreens Boots Alliance on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\r\nSpokesperson: Walgreens Boots Alliance\r\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/walgreens-boots-alliance\r\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com",

And the ride hasn't got any smoother in recent times over the last year, with the price 47% lower in that time. Furthermore, it's down 25% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.\n\nSince Walgreens Boots Alliance has shed US$2.2b from its value in the past 7 days, let's see if the longer term decline has been driven by the business' economics.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally hope to see good revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one would hope for good top-line growth to make up for the lack of earnings.\n\nIn the last three years, Walgreens Boots Alliance saw its revenue grow by 3.4% per year, compound. That's not a very high growth rate considering it doesn't make profits. This uninspiring revenue growth has no doubt helped send the share price lower; it dropped 18% during the period. When a stock falls hard like this, some investors like to add the company to a watchlist (in case the business recovers, longer term). Keep in mind it isn't unusual for good businesses to have a tough time or a couple of uninspiring years.\n\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nStory continues earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Walgreens Boots Alliance will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Walgreens Boots Alliance's TSR for the last 3 years was -59%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nInvestors in Walgreens Boots Alliance had a tough year, with a total loss of 43% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 28%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 9% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Walgreens Boots Alliance better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Walgreens Boots Alliance that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this freelist of growing companies with insider buying.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

But who are \u2018insiders\u2019?\n\nAn insider is defined by Section 16 of the Security Exchange Act as an officer, director, 10% stockholder, or anyone who possesses information because of their relationship with the company.\n\nOf course, many strict rules apply to insiders. Notably, they have a longer holding period than most, a critical aspect investors should know.\n\nSeveral companies \u2013 Dollar Tree DLTR, Walgreens Boot Alliance WBA, Synopsys SNPS, Snowflake SNOW, and lululemon Athletica LULU \u2013 have all seen recent insider activity. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the transactions for those interested in trading like the insiders.\n\nSnowflake\n\nSnowflake develops database architecture, data warehouses, query optimization, and parallelization solutions. The CEO recently swooped in and purchased roughly 31.5k shares, with a total transaction value just above $5 million.\n\nShares have had a tough showing following its latest set of quarterly results, down nearly 30% since the report date and widely underperforming relative to the general market.

Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nlululemon Athletica\n\nlululemon designs, manufactures, and distributes athletic apparel and accessories for women, men, and female youth. A director recently purchased 700 LULU shares, with the transaction totaling nearly $275k.\n\nMargin expansion has been a big driver behind the strong share performance over the last several years, as we can see below. Shares faced selling pressure following its latest set of quarterly results, with +15% year-over-year revenue growth reflecting a deceleration.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDollar Tree\n\nDollar Tree operates discount variety stores, offering a wide range of quality everyday general merchandise in many categories.

        "title": "Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this largest U.S. drugstore chain have returned -11.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, which Walgreens falls in, has lost 1.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nWalgreens is expected to post earnings of $0.74 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -26%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -16%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.23 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -18.8%. This estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.23 indicates no change from what Walgreens is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.9%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Walgreens.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Walgreens, the consensus sales estimate of $35.98 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.6%. The $145.72 billion and $151.24 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.8% and +3.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nWalgreens reported revenues of $37.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.3%. EPS of $1.20 for the same period compares with $1.16 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.22 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.29%. The EPS surprise was +46.34%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Walgreens surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nWalgreens is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walgreens. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights CVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Herbalife and Amazon",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 April 4, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses CVS Health CVS, Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA, Herbalife Ltd HLF and Amazon AMZN.\n\nIndustry: Retail Pharmacy\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2249606/2-retail-pharmacy-stocks-to-watch-and-one-to-avoid-amid-industry-headwind\n\nThe three-year-long historic public health crisis significantly altered the structure and trend of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry. On a positive note, amid acute supply-chain disruption and staffing shortages within healthcare, the retail pharmacy business witnessed high demand, thanks to the exponentially growing demand for distant medical services and remote patient care. Particularly, mail-order pharmacies registered growth by adopting digital health services in the form of telehealth and remote monitoring.\n\nWith digitization, retail industry players are also significantly strengthening their omnichannel presence from sole brick-and-mortar dependency. All these are creating unique opportunities for industry stalwarts like CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance, which are investing strategically in easy patient access to prescription and maintenance medications.\n\nHowever, the majority of the retail pharmacy and drug store heavyweights have been southbound due to the ongoing pressure of inflation and labor shortages. Further, unfavorable drug pricing and reimbursement are a burden on this sector. Added to this, with the end of the pandemic, demand for related retail health support has decreased, resulting in a significant drop in pandemic-led revenue generation for the industry players.\n\nHerbalife Ltd is one such stock whose performance is negatively impacted by these industry-wide trends. Last but not least, perceiving the huge growth prospects of this space, there have been a number of new entries that have increased the competitiveness in the space. In particular, a stalwart like Amazon\u2019s entry into the retail drugstore space has created a survival issue among the existing entities.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry includes retailing of a range of prescription and over-the-counter medications. The broad retail network of companies within the retail pharmacy industry delivers advanced health solutions to patients, customers and caregivers. Over the past few years, the scope of the retail pharmacy and drugstore market has expanded exponentially.\n\nIn North America, some of these entities evolved to add wellness products and groceries to their traditional portfolio of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Looking at the attractive growth potential of this industry, non-healthcare leaders like Amazon, in 2018, acquired pharmacy delivery startup PillPack to enter the U.S. healthcare space.\n\n3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Industry\n\nA Difficult Pharmacy Reimbursement Scenario: Brand-name drugs that hold wide profit margins are protected with a reliable supply chain. However, low-margin generic drugs, which have a fragile supply-chain network, have been bearing the brunt of the ongoing economic slump. Drug retailers are also witnessing a constant rise in medicine prices, stemming from the rising cost of raw materials.\n\nThe industry players are currently grappling with continued pressure from non-reimbursable pharmacy expenses, which are significantly pulling down mass demand for prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs and vaccinations. It has been widely observed that patients are replacing prescription medicines with low-cost generic drugs.\n\nMeanwhile, to improve operating margins, pharmacy retailers have announced plans to reduce their footprint. In this line, in December 2023, CVS Health stated that it would change the way of pricing its prescription drugs with new pharmacy reimbursement.\n\nAmazon's Entry Steals Market Share: Amazon Pharmacy\u2019s omnichannel performance has been significantly robust since its inception. Going by a Viseven report dated Jan 5, 2023, Amazon\u2019s omnichannel experiences are the keystone to customer retention, helping it cover previous sales reductions. This has significantly increased competition in the retail pharmacy market.\n\nIn October 2023, Amazon Pharmacy announced the launch of a drone delivery service. Amazon Pharmacy is currently using generative artificial intelligence to fill prescriptions more quickly and accurately, accelerate customer service and ensure the right quantities of medications in stock.\n\nFollowing its entry into the healthcare market, the e-commerce giant has grabbed a significant chunk of the online pharmacy market. With several other initiatives in progress, needless to say, Amazon\u2019s emergence as a major pharmacy services player is a significant blow to the industry, putting retail pharmacy and drugstore stocks in a tighter spot.\n\nMassive Digital Adoption: Thanks to the pandemic, there has been a significant shift in demand toward mail order and online pharmacies. Even in the current post-pandemic phase, pharmacy retailers experience growing consumer preference for these alternative channels compared to brick-and-mortar pharmacies. The digital pharmacy market is rapidly gaining popularity in recent times in the form of improving access to physicians, diagnosis and treatments.\n\nAccording to an Insight Partners report, the digital pharmacy market size was valued at $96.4 billion in 2022. It is projected to reach a global market size of $363.9 billion by 2030. A 2023 pharmacy study by J.D. Power (as published in Progressive Grosser) noted that while customer reliance on digital platforms was 76% in 2022, the same shot up to 81% in 2023. The top digital channels cited by mail-order customers were pharmacy websites (59%), mobile apps (34%) and text messages (29%). The companies are strategically attempting to grow digitally.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Near-Term Prospects\n\nThe industry\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, housed within the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #234, placing it in the bottom 7% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nWe will present a few stocks that have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. However, it\u2019s worth taking a look at the industry\u2019s shareholder returns and current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Underperforms S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 Composite as well as its sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 8% over this period against the Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s growth of 29.7%. The S&P 500 Composite has risen 28.4% over the said time frame.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 8.50X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 21.38X and the sector\u2019s 22.86X.\n\nOver the last five years, the sector has traded as high as 11.88X, as low as 7.18X, and at the median of 8.98X.\n\n2 Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Stocks in Focus and 1 to Avoid\n\nCVS Health is committed to increasing investments in fast-growing spaces like enterprise data platforms, cloud capabilities and digital products to offer innovative solutions through mobile and web channels. The company is investing in emerging technology capabilities such as voice, artificial intelligence and robotics to automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for its constituents. CVS Health\u2019s solid digital engagement and enhanced capabilities should strengthen its ability to drive seasonal flu and RFD immunization awareness and connect patients to the CVS locations for these important health services.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues indicates a 3.6% rise from the 2023 level. CVS Health, which presently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 9.1%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWalgreens Boots continued to transform the method of delivering healthcare through physical stores and digital channels. The company\u2019s network of micro fulfillment centers is helping to stabilize staffing and pharmacy hours, reduce work full pain points and free up capacity to drive the outcomes that matter most to its patients and partners. WBA is also piloting a virtual pharmacy to redefine connected care, increase patient access, enhance workplace flexibility and extend its pharmacist reach. At present, Walgreens Boots 11 micro-fulfilment centers currently support 4,600 stores.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues indicates growth of 4.4% from the 2023 reported figure. The company\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 5%. Walgreens Boots carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nHerbalife, as a premier health and wellness company and community, offers science-backed products to consumers in more than 90 markets through entrepreneurial distributors. It provides products in the areas of weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports, and fitness, outer nutrition, and literature and promotion items. The company is currently experiencing a decline in sales. Herbalife's direct-selling business model and product range, which includes weight management and nutrition products, are facing challenges amid a complex economic environment.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues indicates a plunge of 18.5% from the 2023 reported figure. The company\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is -4%. Herbalife carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at present.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Momentum has been driving the market, led by artificial intelligence stocks, with the S&P 500 up 10% for the first quarter. However, the markets have started broadening, with financials, industrials and energy stocks also rallying. This deeper dive will unearth some of the best bargain stocks to buy in April to take advantage of the improving market breadth.\n\nIndeed, the market has had a scorching run since the bottom on Oct. 27, 2023. Since then, the S&P 500 is up 27%. Technology stocks, especially AI stocks, have outperformed massively and may be due for a breather. After all, parabolic moves don\u2019t go on forever; eventually, reversion to the mean occurs.\n\nThis means that the value-conscious investor must look elsewhere to play this bull market. Luckily, there are plenty of bargain stocks to buy in April that are not overextended. Notably, these companies have a forward price-to-earnings below 15 and don\u2019t necessarily need earnings growth. Multiple expansion from current levels could push the stocks higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter a decade of underperformance, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) could stage an incredible comeback under the leadership of new CEO Tim Wentworth. On March 28, the company reported Q2 fiscal year 2024 results, taking a $5.8 billion after-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to VillageMD. Excluding the charge, the results were okay. Revenue was up 6.28% year over year (YOY) and adjusted EPS was up 3.4% to $1.20.\n\nUnder the new leadership, the company is pursuing an aggressive cost-savings plan. In the Q2 FY2024 earnings call, management indicated they could deliver a $600 million reduction in capex and see $500 million in working capital benefits. Management is also taking a strategic view of all business segments and making several operational improvements.\n\nIn response to customers facing inflationary pressures, the U.S. retail pharmacy unit is investing in key value items. Furthermore, it is focusing on customer experience by enhancing support for pickup in-store and same -day delivery.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere were other positive developments in the quarter. Pharmacy had another strong quarter of execution, and U.S. Healthcare delivered the first quarter of positive EBITDA. For FY2024, management narrowed its adjusted EPS guidance to $3.20 to $3.35. Therefore, WBA stock is one of the best bargain stocks to buy in April at 7 times forward earnings.\n\nVital Energy (VTLE) Panorama of Oil and Gas central processing platform in twilight, offshore hard work occupation twenty four working hours. Best oil stocks to buy\n\nSource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith oil demand firming, crude oil prices have steadily increased since early February. Over the last two months, they have moved from $73 to $81 per barrel. At these high prices, Vital Energy (NYSE:VTLE) is one of the best bargain stocks to buy in April.\n\nThe independent energy company has just closed an impressive 2023. It completed six high-value acquisitions in the Permian Basin at a cost of $1.6 billion. As a result, it acquired 90,000 acres and established a core position in the Delaware Basin. According to management, these acquisitions will increase Q1 2024 production by 50% YOY.\n\n2023 results were a highlight across all metrics. Total production was 96.6 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing a 22% increase from FY2022. Net income for the year was $695.1 million and adjusted free cash flow was $217.1 million.\n\nThe oil producer entered 2024 with healthy proved reserves of 404.9 million BOE, a 34% increase from 2022. Moreover, management expects to grow free cash flow by 60% in 2024. Looking at valuation multiples, Vital Energy is cheap at a trailing EV/EBITDA multiple of 3. Indeed, it\u2019s one of the best bargain stocks to buy in the energy sector.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights. AVCT stock. cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Blackboard / Shutterstock\n\nGigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT) offers an online business-to-business marketplace. The company aims to revolutionize how suppliers and resellers manage big and bulky items. It is a full-service, end-to-end B2B solution provider.\n\nAs Q4 2023 results showed, the business is growing rapidly as they onboard more resellers. FY2023 revenues were $703.8 million, up 43.6%. Quarterly growth was even higher, with revenues of $244.7 million, growing 94.8% YOY and 37.3% quarter-over-quarter. For the full year, the company generated adjusted EBITDA of $108.3 million compared to $41.8 million in 2022.\n\nLooking at the top operational highlights for 2023, GigaCloud Technology is one of the best bargain stocks to buy in April. Gross merchandise volume increased 53.3% YOY to $794.4 million and third-party sellers grew 45.5% to close the quarter at 815. On the buyer side, active buyers grew 20.5% from 2022 levels, exceeding 5,000. Additionally, the average spending per buyer increased 27.2% to $158,569.\n\nThe firm made two strategic acquisitions \u2013 Noble House and Wondersign \u2013 in 2023 to accelerate growth. Wondersign will support entry into the brick-and-mortar market. It will facilitate the integration of retail systems into its expanding B2B digital catalog.\n\nBased on Q1 2024 revenue guidance of $230 to 240 million, management expects at least 80% growth. Despite the impressive growth, you can buy GCT stock at a bargain 10 times forward earnings. This is a growth stock that should be in your portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "It's been a difficult decade for investors in retail and pharmacy company Walgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA). The stock has been trending downward for years as persistent challenges soured market sentiment.\n\nAn analyst at TD Cowen remains optimistic that Walgreens stock could see a major rebound. While TD Cowen reduced its price target from $37 to $35 today, it maintained a buy rating on the stock. Based on the current stock price, the new price target implies an upside of about 87%.\n\nFavorable risk/reward\n\nWhile the TD Cowen analyst doesn't expect Walgreens' results to necessarily improve, a favorable risk/reward trade-off is at the foundation of the lofty price target. Walgreens narrowed its full-year guidance in March to reflect a \"challenging retail environment in the U.S.\" and a few other issues. This new target is achievable, according to TD Cowen.\n\nWalgreens now expects to report adjusted earnings per share between $3.20 and $3.35 in 2024, while it continues to expect the U.S. healthcare business to break even on an adjusted EBITDA basis. The bottom line has fallen off a cliff over the past few years. Walgreens reported adjusted EPS of $4.91 in 2021.\n\nWhile earnings are in decline, the TD Cowen analyst isn't wrong about a sizable potential upside if the company can hit its targets. At the midpoint of Walgreens guidance range, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio below 6.\n\nIs Walgreens stock a buy?\n\nWhile an 87% surge in Walgreens stock is certainly possible, buying a stock solely because its valuation has been beaten to a pulp can be a recipe for disaster. Walgreens stock has looked cheap for years, and the only thing investors have gotten in return is a tumbling stock.\n\nWalgreens might be a solid turnaround play. The company appointed a new CEO in October, and he's already made some tough decisions like slashing the dividend to preserve cash. But the stock still looks risky.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Retail Pharmacy Stocks to Watch and One to Avoid Amid Industry Headwinds",
        "content": "The three-year-long historic public health crisis significantly altered the structure and trend of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry. On a positive note, amid acute supply-chain disruption and staffing shortages within healthcare, the retail pharmacy business witnessed high demand, thanks to the exponentially growing demand for distant medical services and remote patient care. Particularly, mail-order pharmacies registered growth by adopting digital health services in the form of telehealth and remote monitoring. With digitization, retail industry players are also significantly strengthening their omnichannel presence from sole brick-and-mortar dependency. All these are creating unique opportunities for industry stalwarts like CVS Health CVS and Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA, which are investing strategically in easy patient access to prescription and maintenance medications.\r\n\r\nHowever, the majority of the retail pharmacy and drug store heavyweights have been southbound due to the ongoing pressure of inflation and labor shortages. Further, unfavorable drug pricing and reimbursement are a burden on this sector. Added to this, with the end of the pandemic, demand for related retail health support has decreased, resulting in a significant drop in pandemic-led revenue generation for the industry players.\r\n\r\nHerbalife Ltd HLF is one such stock whose performance is negatively impacted by these industry-wide trends. Last but not least, perceiving the huge growth prospects of this space, there have been a number of new entries that have increased the competitiveness in the space. In particular, a stalwart like Amazon\u2019s AMZN entry into the retail drugstore space has created a survival issue among the existing entities.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry includes retailing of a range of prescription and over-the-counter medications. The broad retail network of companies within the retail pharmacy industry delivers advanced health solutions to patients, customers and caregivers. Over the past few years, the scope of the retail pharmacy and drugstore market has expanded exponentially.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn North America, some of these entities evolved to add wellness products and groceries to their traditional portfolio of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Looking at the attractive growth potential of this industry, non-healthcare leaders like Amazon, in 2018, acquired pharmacy delivery startup PillPack to enter the U.S. healthcare space.\n\n3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Industry\n\nA Difficult Pharmacy Reimbursement Scenario: Brand-name drugs that hold wide profit margins are protected with a reliable supply chain. However, low-margin generic drugs, which have a fragile supply-chain network, have been bearing the brunt of the ongoing economic slump. Drug retailers are also witnessing a constant rise in medicine prices, stemming from the rising cost of raw materials. The industry players are currently grappling with continued pressure from non-reimbursable pharmacy expenses, which are significantly pulling down mass demand for prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs and vaccinations. It has been widely observed that patients are replacing prescription medicines with low-cost generic drugs.\n\nMeanwhile, to improve operating margins, pharmacy retailers have announced plans to reduce their footprint. In this line, in December 2023, CVS Health stated that it would change the way of pricing its prescription drugs with new pharmacy reimbursement.\n\nAmazon's Entry Steals Market Share: Amazon Pharmacy\u2019s omnichannel performance has been significantly robust since its inception. Going by a Viseven report dated Jan 5, 2023, Amazon\u2019s omnichannel experiences are the keystone to customer retention, helping it cover previous sales reductions. This has significantly increased competition in the retail pharmacy market. In October 2023, Amazon Pharmacy announced the launch of a drone delivery service. Amazon Pharmacy is currently using generative artificial intelligence to fill prescriptions more quickly and accurately, accelerate customer service and ensure the right quantities of medications in stock.\n\nFollowing its entry into the healthcare market, the e-commerce giant has grabbed a significant chunk of the online pharmacy market.\u00a0 With several other initiatives in progress, needless to say, Amazon\u2019s emergence as a major pharmacy services player is a significant blow to the industry, putting retail pharmacy and drugstore stocks in a tighter spot.\n\nMassive Digital Adoption: Thanks to the pandemic, there has been a significant shift in demand toward mail order and online pharmacies. Even in the current post-pandemic phase, pharmacy retailers experience growing consumer preference for these alternative channels compared to brick-and-mortar pharmacies. The digital pharmacy market is rapidly gaining popularity in recent times in the form of improving access to physicians, diagnosis and treatments.\n\nAccording to an Insight Partners report, the digital pharmacy market size was valued at $96.4 billion in 2022. It is projected to reach a global market size of $363.9 billion by 2030. A 2023 pharmacy study by J.D. Power (as published in Progressive Grosser) noted that while customer reliance on digital platforms was 76% in 2022, the same shot up to 81% in 2023. The top digital channels cited by mail-order customers were pharmacy websites (59%), mobile apps (34%) and text messages (29%). The companies are strategically attempting to grow digitally.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Near-Term Prospects\n\nThe industry\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, housed within the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #234, placing it in the bottom 7% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nWe will present a few stocks that have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. However, it\u2019s worth taking a look at the industry\u2019s shareholder returns and current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Underperforms S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 Composite as well as its sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 8% over this period against the Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s growth of 29.7%. The S&P 500 Composite has risen 28.4% over the said time frame.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 8.50X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 21.38X and the sector\u2019s 22.86X.\n\nOver the last five years, the sector has traded as high as 11.88X, as low as 7.18X, and at the median of 8.98X, as the charts below show.\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)\n\n2 Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Stocks in Focus and 1 to Avoid\n\nCVS Health is committed to increasing investments in fast-growing spaces like enterprise data platforms, cloud capabilities and digital products to offer innovative solutions through mobile and web channels. The company is investing in emerging technology capabilities such as voice, artificial intelligence and robotics to automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for its constituents. CVS Health\u2019s solid digital engagement and enhanced capabilities should strengthen its ability to drive seasonal flu and RFD immunization awareness and connect patients to the CVS locations for these important health services.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues indicates a 3.6% rise from the 2023 level. CVS Health, which presently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 9.1%.  You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nPrice and Consensus: CVS\n\nWalgreens Boots continued to transform the method of delivering healthcare through physical stores and digital channels. The company\u2019s network of micro fulfillment centers is helping to stabilize staffing and pharmacy hours, reduce work full pain points and free up capacity to drive the outcomes that matter most to its patients and partners. WBA is also piloting a virtual pharmacy to redefine connected care, increase patient access, enhance workplace flexibility and extend its pharmacist reach.\u00a0 At present, Walgreens Boots 11 micro-fulfilment centers currently support 4,600 stores.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues indicates growth of 4.4% from the 2023 reported figure. The company\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 5%. Walgreens Boots carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nPrice and Consensus: WBA\n\nHerbalife, as a premier health and wellness company and community, offers science-backed products to consumers in more than 90 markets through entrepreneurial distributors. It provides products in the areas of weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports, and fitness, outer nutrition, and literature and promotion items. The company is currently experiencing a decline in sales. Herbalife's direct-selling business model and product range, which includes weight management and nutrition products, are facing challenges amid a complex economic environment.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues indicates a plunge of 18.5% from the 2023 reported figure. The company\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is -4%. Herbalife carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at present.\n\nPrice and Consensus: HLF\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Each company operates in the broad domains of pharmaceuticals and healthcare, positioning it strategically to take advantage of new trends and consumer needs.\n\nStrategic business development activities supporting the company\u2019s growth trajectory lead the way. Collaborations with peers in the sector further enhance the first company\u2019s skills. This guarantees a continuous focus on innovation and meeting unmet medical demands.\n\nThe second one uses its knowledge of pharmacies to drive strong sales growth and profitability in the healthcare industry. The company\u2019s reputation as the top pharmacy and retail brand in the UK is cemented by its strategic efforts that show resilience in the face of market adversities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the meantime, the third exhibits remarkable income growth and diversity throughout its business divisions. The company can effectively cater to a wide range of consumer demands by prioritizing expanding pharmaceutical services and healthcare benefits.\n\nExplore these three companies\u2019 fundamental edge and strategic moves by reading on.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) Bristol-Myers (BMY) logo at the top of a cellphone.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) has expanded its portfolio and uplifted its growth profile through strategic business development moves. These specific initiatives are the acquisitions of RayzeBio, Mirati Therapeutics and Karuna Therapeutics. These acquisitions derive cutting-edge platforms and attractive pipeline assets to boost the company\u2019s current offering.\n\nIn detail, the acquisition of Karuna Therapeutics supports KarXT\u2019s multi-billion-dollar sales potential. KarXT may become a possible therapy for schizophrenia and Alzheimer\u2019s psychosis. Similarly, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s oncology portfolio gains considerable radiopharmaceutical assets and pipeline potency with the purchase of RayzeBio.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, the company has joined strategic alliances, including the one with SystImmune, to get unique technology and specific oncology resources. Through these collaborations, Bristol-Myers Squibb can spur advancement and capture market demand.\n\nFurthermore, the proposed purchase of Karuna Therapeutics may dilute profits by\u00a0around 30 cents due to financing expenses and OpEx absorption. Similarly, RayzeBio\u2019s purchase would result in approximately 13 cents in dilutive earnings after financing and out-of-pocket expenses. Lastly, the Mirati Therapeutics acquisition intensified targeted oncology assets to Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s oncology portfolio, considerably diversifying it.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nFocusing on advancing its healthcare products and utilizing pharmacy intelligence, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) has seen solid top-line growth and a progressive bottom line.\n\nIn Q2 2024, Walgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s pharmacy comp sales increased by\u00a08.7% year over year (YoY), indicating a robust demand for prescription drugs. Factors including prescription volume increases, brand inflation and pharmacy services\u2019 contributions propelled this rise. Thus, the boost in pharmacy comp sales demonstrates Walgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s fundamental capacity to gain market share and spur top-line expansion in the retail pharmacy sector.\n\nAdditionally, Walgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s healthcare capabilities were enriched with the\u00a0acquisition of Summit Health and the collaboration with VillageMD. These moves enable the company to deliver extensive services to clients.\n\nConversely, Boots UK has shown fortitude in difficult market circumstances, reporting\u00a0a 3.2% YoY increase in sales, propelled by robust retail comp performance and increases in market share. The sharp implementation of strategic initiatives facilitated the expansion of Boots UK\u2019s revenues.\n\nOverall, Walgreens Boots Alliance has a lead as the UK\u2019s top pharmacy and retail brand. Hence, this was strengthened by Boots UK\u2019s flexibility in capturing shifting demands.\n\nCVS Health (CVS) The front sign for a CVS Pharmacy, CVS stock\n\nSource: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.com\n\nCVS Health (NYSE:CVS) reports top-line growth and diversity throughout its business segments. The company derived $93.8 billion in consolidated Q4 revenues, a considerable 11.9% YoY growth.\n\nSimilarly, CVS Health\u2019s consolidated revenue for 2023 was $357.8 billion, a boost of 10.9% YoY. This demonstrates CVS Health\u2019s fundamental capacity to increase its top-line steadily. This may continue to support its strong lead in the market and the demand from clients for its offerings.\n\nMoreover, CVS Health\u2019s operational diversity can be comprehended by segmenting revenue. Revenues for the Healthcare Benefits division increased to about\u00a0$27 billion in Q4, a significant rise of more than 16% from the previous year. Several product lines, such as commercial, Medicare and individual exchange, contributed to this rise, demonstrating the segment\u2019s adaptability and capacity to meet a wide range of client demands.\n\nFurthermore, the Health Services segment \u2014 which includes pharmaceutical services and healthcare delivery companies \u2014 reported over\u00a0$49 billion in sales for Q4, indicating an increase of over 12% YoY. Lastly, the main drivers of this development were the strong success in pharmacy services and acquisitions like Oak Street and Signify Health, which highlight CVS Health\u2019s expansion ambitions and wise investments.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in WBA.

        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript March 28, 2024\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $1.2, expectations were $0.82. WBA isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good day. Thank you for standing by. morning. Welcome to the Walgreens Boots Alliance Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chris Dale, Group Vice President, Finance, Planning and Analysis. Please go ahead.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Walgreens Boots Alliance earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. I'm Chris Dale, Group Vice President of Financial, Planning and Analysis, filling in Tiffany. Joining me on today's call are Tim Wentworth, our Chief Executive Officer; Mary Langowski, President of US Healthcare and Manmohan Mahajan, Global Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Rick Gates, Senior Vice President and Walgreen\u2019s Chief Pharmacy Officer and Tracey Brown, President of Walgreens Retail and Chief Customer Officer, will participate in Q&A. As always, during the conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations.\n\nOur actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 2, and those outlined in our latest Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement after this presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. You can find our press release and the slides referenced on this call in the Investors section of the Walgreens Boots Alliance website. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations are set forth in the press release. You may also refer to the slides posted to the Investors section of our website, for reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed during this earnings call.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe encourage you to review the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliation to non-GAAP values and other earnings materials we provided. I will now turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTim Wentworth: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. WBA's second quarter operational results were in line with our expectations despite continued challenges in the U S. retail environment. Adjusted EPs of $1.20 reflects good execution and cost discipline in our U.S. retail pharmacy segment, continued strong performance in the international, our first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA in U.S. Healthcare, and positive impacts from tax planning benefits. During the quarter, we recognized a $5.8 billion after-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge net of non-controlling interest related to our investment in VillageMD. This charge is excluded from any of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings measures. We are narrowing full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $3.20 to $3.35.\n\nThis guidance reflects the challenging retail environment in the U.S. and our decisions to both winddown the sale leaseback program and to sell additional shares of Cencora in a further effort to simplify our financial reporting. We expect these impacts to be partially offset by execution in pharmacy services and tax favorability. We have recently solidified our leadership team, which I believe has the capabilities and commitment to best lead WBA into its future. Once again, I'm excited to welcome our newest WBA leaders who were announced this quarter. Elizabeth Burger, as Chief Human Resources Officer, Lanesha Minnix as Chief Legal Officer, and Mary Langowski as President of U.S. Healthcare. They joined Manmohan Mahajan, who was confirmed as our Chief Financial Officer, and Beth Leonard, who was named our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer in rounding out our Executive Committee.\n\nTogether, our Executive Committee is comprised of individuals that bring an established track record of operational excellence and are all based together in Chicago, working to drive collaboration and acting with urgency to drive results. Over the next three months, we will continue the intense review of our portfolio of assets in an effort to ensure that each contributes to the growth we aspire to deliver and drives our go-forward strategy to be the leading retail pharmacy and health services partner that creates deep relationships and trust. Let me share further detail on the progress happening across our businesses to date. In our U.S. retail pharmacy business, we are navigating a challenging backdrop and exploring innovative pathways to boost profitability and growth.\n\nWithin retail, our US customers confronting considerable pressure from multiyear inflationary trends and depleted household savings with US household debt at record levels and delinquency rates on the rise. Our shopper is making deliberate choices to seek value resulting in channel shifting behavior. We're responding to these market dynamics by making investments in key value items and focusing our capabilities to engage with customers in an intelligent, targeted way. Additionally, we have implemented initiatives to improve front-end performance. We are leaning into the massive and timely opportunity to increase own brand penetration, now standing at 17.1%, up 95 basis points year-over-year. We expect that we can further expand with a meaningful margin advantage over national brands.\n\nWe plan to deepen our partnership with a reduced set of national suppliers, carefully selecting who we work with alongside our own brands. Operationally, we're intensely focused on the customer experience and meeting customers where, when, and how they want to shop. That means enhancing the experience not only in-store, but ordering online for pickup in-store and also same -day delivery, where over 80% of orders are received in less than an hour. Additionally, we are empowering our store managers and field leaders to share in our company\u2019s anticipated growth and increase their ability to impact areas that matter most to their stores and their customers. To do this, we are realigning incentives in an effort to place much greater weight on individual store performance.\n\nMoving to pharmacy, we delivered another quarter of strong execution with outperformance in pharmacy services led by our vaccines portfolio. While market growth was slower than originally anticipated, we maintained market share. Our 11 micro-fulfillment centers currently support 4, 600 stores, which is over half our footprint. Earlier this year, we talked about pausing the rollout of additional micro fulfillment centers as we work to optimize the model that gives our pharmacists and technicians the ability to spend more time on customer-facing activities and less time on core dispensing. We are seeing benefits, such as improved MPA scores, patient retention, and adherence. Not only is this better for the patient, it improves team member retention and talent acquisition as they perform more of the clinical activities that they are so well-trained to do.\n\nWe are focused on creating an environment that makes us the practice setting of choice for pharmacists. In fact, earlier this month, we kicked off our first Dean's Advisory Council meeting with the mission of re-energizing and evolving the definition of community pharmacy as demand for pharmacy services increases while the industry faces a pronounced labor shortage. We are on a mission to achieve provider status for our pharmacists given their influence, which was so clearly highlighted during the pandemic. This would allow them to be reimbursed for providing select health care services to patients. These are highly trained clinical professionals just five miles or less from most Americans whose scope of practice goes well beyond dispensing medications and includes immunizations, patient counseling, and point-of-care testing for infectious diseases.\n\nAs an example of what is ultimately possible, in the UK, the NHS Pharmacy First Service, which launched on January 31st, expands the role of Boots pharmacists throughout England to advise and prescribe for the treatment of seven common health conditions. This model serves as a use case of new ways to fully deploy pharmacist capabilities to lighten the burden on the broader healthcare system. Speaking of value, there is real opportunity for change and transparency in reimbursement models to help slow the inflationary pressures on drug prices and our patients' wallets. We already operate in the number of cost-plus and other alternative reimbursement models very successfully and welcome any model that reimburses us for the unmatched value we provide patients.\n\nWe are having more active and constructive conversations with PBMs and other payers around cost-plus models. Many of these discussions are still in early stages, but they share a general theme. There is value to all from a transparent, predictable model where what patients pay at the counter is rationally tied to the cost of the drug. We don't expect an industry shift to happen overnight, as there are a number of dynamics that need to be worked out, but it's especially encouraging to see PBMs and payers open to these models. Now turning to U.S. Healthcare, we have reached an important milestone, delivering our first ever quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA and another quarter of significant year-on-year growth. Shields continues to deliver strong top and bottom line performance as their differentiated model is driving significant value for health system partners, which has resulted in several recent long-term extensions.\n\nVillageMD's actions to accelerate profitability, including recent rightsizing of their cost structure, optimizing their clinic footprint, and growing patient panels are driving improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Full risk lives grew by 19% year-on year in the second quarter. As Village prioritizes density in their highest opportunity markets, they decided in January to exit a total of approximately 160 clinics, inclusive of the 60 that had been previously communicated. As of today, they have already exited 140 locations. Manmohan will discuss in more detail our recent reevaluation of our investment in VillageMD. Shifting to International, the business once again performed well, demonstrating strong and consistent execution highlighted by meaningful retail comp growth at Boots UK and a 12th successive quarter of market share gains.\n\nFinally, let me offer further detail on the progress of our swift actions to right-size the WBA cost structure and increase cash flow across the company. We have a very high degree of visibility into the $1 billion in cost savings this year as actions already taken to date will account for a significant majority of the total. We're driving savings primarily in our U.S. retail pharmacy segment in three ways. Organizational initiatives, including support office workforce reductions, location optimization, and additional pharmacy and retail operating model improvements. We are also working to improve cash flow by prioritizing projects and capital spend. In the first half, CapEx was $250 million lower than the prior year period. We are on track to deliver a $600 million reduction for the full year and $500 million in working capital benefits in fiscal 2024.\n\nNext, I'd like to introduce Mary Langowski to say a few words. She'll then hand it over to Manmohan to review our financial results in further detail.\n\nMary Langowski : Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone. I'm excited to join you all today and I'm thrilled to be a part of this iconic company. I've spent 25 years in the healthcare, government, and retail sectors. My career is focused on leading teams to unlock new areas of growth, commercialize new products and healthcare services, and accelerate execution through financial discipline. I've been fortunate to have worked with some of the most successful Fortune 50 and healthcare growth companies that have sought to embrace and drive change to improve the healthcare system. At CVS Health, I led and executed a strategy to expand healthcare services, leveraging the company's core assets, including leading aspects of CVS' acquisition of Aetna.\n\nMost recently, I was CEO of Solera Health, a leading digital health technology company serving payers and employers, where I led a transformation of the business, launching new condition product lines, a new technology platform, and a new economic model to support sustained growth. My vantage point of working across providers, pharma, payers, and retail has made one thing clear. Very few companies have the platform, access, and reach of Walgreens. Since the announcement, I have heard from health plans, health systems, and others who see an opportunity to partner with Walgreens. They know the value of our community presence, the role our pharmacists can play, and the need for higher touch, more frequent, and lower cost engagement to drive better health outcomes.\n\nHealthcare is changing and consumer expectations are changing. In the face of that, we believe Walgreens is still the best position to be the most convenient entry point into the healthcare system. And our position as an independent partner, able to work with any health plan of PBM, is a true strength that we will capitalize on. Finally, I want to congratulate the team on achieving positive adjusted EBITDA in U.S. healthcare this quarter. It's a significant milestone, and we will continue to build on this progress to drive value for our shareholders, customers, and patients. Thanks to Tim and the board for this opportunity. I'll now turn it to Manmohan. A pharmacist discussing the health benefits of a prescription medication with a customer.\n\nManmohan Mahajan : Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Overall, second quarter operational results were in line with our expectations. Sales grew 5.7% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Retail Pharmacy increased 4.7%, International was up 3.2%, and U.S. Healthcare delivered performance sales growth of 14%. Adjusted EPS of $1.20 increased year-over-year by 2.8% on a constant currency basis. Reflecting improved profitability in our U.S. Healthcare segment, impact of cost savings, and a lower adjusted effective tax rate. Offset by the lower U.S. retail performance and lower sale leaseback gains. The lower adjusted effective tax rate reflects the initial recognition of a deferred tax asset in certain international jurisdictions.\n\nGAAP net loss for the second quarter included a $5.8 billion noncash impairment charge related to VillageMD goodwill. During the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823, we disclosed that our annual goodwill impairment test for our VillageMD reporting unit resulted in its fair value exceeding its carrying value by a narrow margin. As a result, we have been closely monitoring the performance of the business for potential indicators of impairment. In February, we received a downward revised longer-term forecast from VillageMD management. Including the impact of closing approximately 160 clinics, inclusive of the 60 previously communicated, slower than expected trends in patient panel growth and multi-specialty productivity and recent changes in Medicare reimbursement models.\n\nThese impacts were partly offset by actions taken in an attempt to right-size the cost structure. Given this revised forecast, we performed an interim test of VillageMD reporting unit goodwill that resulted in a fair value below its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a $12.4 billion noncash goodwill impairment charge prior to the attribution of loss to non-controlling interests. On an after-tax basis and net of 47% non-controlling interest, this resulted in a net loss of $5.8 billion in the quarter. This charge is excluded from non-GAAP earnings measures. The fair value of the business was determined using a combination of the income and market approaches. The impairment charge is due to the lower than previously expected longer-term financial performance expectations, challenged market multiples for VillageMD's peer group, which have continued to decline, and increased discount rates.\n\nAs a reminder, our share of VillageMD's net assets carrying value also included a $2 billion gain recognized on the equity interest owned by the company immediately prior to the acquisition of majority equity interest in VillageMD during the first quarter of fiscal \u201822. This goodwill write-off is noncash, and we do not believe it will have a significant impact on our financial position or our ability to invest across businesses going forward. During the first half of fiscal \u201824, we have seen positive financial impacts from the recent actions taken by VillageMD management team to accelerate profitability. We believe the focused approach on improving performance in core markets, as well as rightsizing the cost structure, will provide VillageMD a platform for future growth.\n\nThe second quarter also included a $455 million noncash impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. As part of a deep dive exercise over the last several months, we concluded during the quarter that instead of continuing to build a new technology platform for pharmacy operations in the U.S., it would be better to modernize our existing system over time with new capabilities in an agile and capital-efficient manner with much lower disruption risk. As a result, we recognize the charge against the underlying software and development assets. Finally, similar to last quarter, we recognized a $474 million gain on the sale of Cencora shares, partly offset by a $396 million after-tax noncash charge for fair value adjustments on variable prepaid forward derivatives related to Cencora shares.\n\nNow let's move on to the first half highlights. Sales increased 7.2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EPS declined 20.5% on constant currency basis due to software U.S. retail performance and lower sale leaseback gains, partly offset by improved profitability in U.S. Healthcare and a lower adjusted effective tax rate. GAAP net loss was $6 billion compared to a loss of $3 billion in the first half of fiscal \u201823. As I explained earlier, the second half of the fiscal \u201824 included certain noncash impairment charges. The prior year period included a $5.4 billion after-tax charge for opioid-related claims and lawsuits, partly offset by a $1.4 billion after-tax gain on the sale of Cencora shares. Now let me cover US Retail Pharmacy segment.\n\nNote that all comparable figures are on a leap year adjusted basis for all segments. Sales grew 4.7% year-on-year driven by brand inflation in pharmacy, prescription volume, and a higher contribution from pharmacy services, which was partly offset by a 4.5% decline in the retail business. AOI declined 29.50% versus the prior year quarter due to lower retail sales volume, elevated levels of shrink and lower sale leaseback gains. Partially offset continued progress on cost savings initiatives. Looking ahead, we are winding down the sale leaseback program and we do not anticipate any material benefit going forward. Sale leaseback gains, net of incremental rent expense, were an approximately $125 million headwind to AOI in the quarter. Let me now turn to U.S. Pharmacy.\n\nPharmacy comp sales increased 8.7%, mainly driven by brand inflation, volume growth, and contribution from pharmacy services. Comp scripts grew 2.9% excluding immunizations in line with the overall prescription market. The ongoing impact of Medicaid redeterminations continued to negatively impact overall market growth. Pharmacy services performed better than expectations driven by our vaccines portfolio. Pharmacy adjusted gross profit was down slightly versus the prior year quarter, with margin negatively impacted by brand mixed impacts and reimbursement pressure net of procurement savings. Turning next to our U.S. Retail business. We continue to see a challenging retail environment with a shift in discretionary spend away from the drug channel as consumers seek value.\n\nComparable retail sales declined 4.3% in the quarter. There were three main drivers. First, as consumer continue pull back on discretionary spending, we saw an impact of approximately 170 basis points from weaker sales in holiday seasonal and general merchandise categories. Second, as expected, we saw a weaker than normal respiratory season, which directly impacted comparable sales by approximately 90 basis points. Third party data showed flu, cold, and respiratory activity was down 6% compared to the prior year quarter. In addition, As cost cold, flu serves as a primary trip driver, there was also an incremental impact from the lower attachment sales. Lastly, weather conditions in January led to a headwind of approximately 40 basis points in the quarter.\n\nRetail gross margin declined year-on-year, impacted by higher shrink, partly offset by benefits from category performance improvement program. Turning next to the International segment, and as always, I will talk in constant currency numbers. The International segment again exceeded our expectations in this quarter, total sales grew 3.2% with Boots UK increasing 3% and Germany wholesale up 5.3%. Segment adjusted growth profit increased by 3.2%. Adjusted operating income was down 32% entirely due to lapping the real estate gains in the year ago period, with underlying growth offsetting inflationary pressures. Let's now cover Boots, UK in detail. Comp pharmacy sales were up 1.7%. Comp retail sales increased 5.9% with all categories showing growth, led by beauty and personal care.\n\nAcross formats, destination health and beauty, flagship, and travel locations performed particularly well. Boots.com sales increased 16.8% year-on-year and represented over 17% of our UK retail sales. Turning next to US Healthcare. The US Healthcare segment delivered its first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. This was the third consecutive quarter of significant year-on-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter sales of $2.2 billion increased 33% compared to the prior year quarter aided by the acquisition of Summit Health. On a pro forma basis, segment sales increased 14%. VillageMD sales of $1.6 billion grew 20% on a pro forma basis. The year-on-year increase was driven by same clinic performance and growth in full risk lives.\n\nShield sales were up 13% as new health system contracts and expansion of existing partnerships led to an over 40% increase in the number of patients on service in the quarter versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $17 million, an improvement of $127 million compared to last year, mainly driven by VillageMD and Shields. We believe VillageMD continues to make progress to accelerate profitability by rightsizing its cost structure and growing its patient panel. Shields saw robust adjusted EBITDA growth compared to the prior year period. Turning next to cash flow. Operating cash flows in the first half of fiscal \u201824 was negatively impacted by roughly $700 million in payments related to legal matters, $380 million Annuity premium contributions related to Boot's pension plan and underlying seasonality.\n\nCapital expenditures declined by $250 million versus the first half of fiscal \u201823. As a result, free cash flow was down by approximately $2 billion versus the prior year. We expect second half free cash flow improvement compared to the first half driven by several factors. First, we expect lower payments related to legal matters in the second half of fiscal \u201824. Second, we remain on track to reduce capital expenditure by approximately $600 million year-over-year. Third, we expect to deliver working capital improvement of $500 million during fiscal \u201824. While we did see some benefit of these initiatives during the first half of \u201824, we expect the majority of these benefits will impact the second half. Lastly, similar to prior years, we believe the underlying working capital seasonality in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and International segments will have a favorable impact on the second half of the year compared to the first half.\n\nI will now turn to guidance. We are narrowing our fiscal \u201824 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.20 to $3.35. The updated range incorporates a challenging US retail environment, lower sale leaseback gains, and reduced Cencora equity income offset by the execution in pharmacy services and a lower adjusted effective tax rate. On the tailwinds, we continue to see strong execution in our pharmacy services business, which has delivered results ahead of our initial plan to date. In addition, we now expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be under 5%. On the headwinds, we expect the challenging retail backdrop will continue to negatively impact our US retail sales in the short term. We now expect fiscal \u201824 retail comp sales to be down approximately 3%.\n\nSecond, with the early winddown of the sale leaseback program, no material gains are expected in the future. Third, the block sale of Cencora shares in February will reduce equity earnings going forward. Lastly, as discussed with the first quarter results, we forecast slightly lower market growth in US pharmacy business compared to our initial guidance. Importantly, based on the progress made in the US Healthcare segment through the first half, we continue to expect segment adjusted EBITDA to be breakeven at the midpoint of the guidance range. This represents an increase of $325 million to $425 million over fiscal \u201823. Next, I will provide additional details on the factors impacting earnings in the second half. In the second half, we will be lapping adjusted EPS of $1.66 in prior year period.\n\nWe expect several key factors to impact the year-over-year comparison. First, the winddown of the sale leaseback program is expected to be a significant headwind in the second half. Second, we will lap incentive accruals reduction in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823. Third, our updated guidance implies a higher tax rate over the remainder of the year. The US Healthcare segment remains on track to achieve $165 million of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA improvement in the second half, based on the midpoint of the guidance range. And finally, within our U.S. Retail Pharmacy business, we expect year-on-year improvement in the second half, driven by cost savings initiatives. With that, let me now pass it back to Tim for his closing remarks.\n\nTim Wentworth: To wrap up, we have hard work ahead of us in our journey to simplify and strengthen WBA, but we are encouraged by our progress. This team has a clear mandate to act with everything on the table to put our business on the right track. We are well-positioned to drive capital-efficient growth, rooted in our retail pharmacy footprint, and build out an asset light health services strategy to deliver care for communities and create value for partners. We've kicked off our strategic planning work. Over the next three to six months, this team is undergoing an in-depth analysis to determine the actions necessary to achieve what we believe will be the optimal portfolio with a focus on maximizing growth potential and generating cash flow.\n\nWe are reviewing every business through a longer-term lens focused on strategic fit, synergy potential, financial upside, and new or complementary capabilities. We are taking a thoughtful approach, fueled by a sense of urgency to finding opportunities to unlock value or validate existing pathways. In my five months with WBA, I have been most impressed with our 330, 000 team members' commitment to our company. In my experience, it's very hard to get that. That pride is foundational to our future growth, ability to consistently execute and create sustainable long-term shareholder value. That dedication also gives me and our team great confidence in our future. Now I would like to open the line for questions.

        "title": "1 Reason to Buy Walgreens, 1 Reason to Sell, and a Better High-Yield Stock to Buy Either Way",
        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) has been a brutal investment for the past nine years. Shares are down more than 75% from the all-time high, reached way back in early 2015. The one saving grace for investors during much of this period was the company's dividend, which the Board was still steadily increasing every year. From 2014 through late 2023, the payout was increased 40%.\n\nWell, even that's gone, with the near-halving of the dividend late last year now resulting in a payout that's 26% lower than it was in 2015.\n\nThe good news is a new CEO is taking steps to slash costs and stimulate profitable growth.\u00a0Is Walgreens stock a buy now? Keep reading for the one reason why it could be compelling, a major yellow flag that says maybe it's not, plus a stock that you may want to consider instead.\n\nReason to buy: A CEO who's accelerating the turnaround\n\nTim Wentworth was named CEO last Oct. 11, and he didn't waste any time in enacting cost-cutting efforts at the company. When it reported first quarter results 12 weeks later, one of the first lines in the press release announced the 48% dividend cut.\n\nThis move made a bold statement that there would be no sacred cows in this turnaround. Prior to the cut, Walgreens had increased its dividend every year for a remarkable 47 years. Wentworth -- with the backing of the Board of Directors, which has the final say on things like dividends -- has quickly taken action to get Walgreens' financial house in order so that it can enact the meaningful changes that it will take to reinvigorate the business and return it to profitable growth.\n\nIn addition to the dividend cut, the company has also taken some real steps to lower costs and expenses. The company says it will cut $1 billion in spending versus 2023, through both lower capital expenditures and working capital improvements.\n\nReason to sell: The math is still a mess\n\nWentworth is acting quickly, and with Board backing. His experience in the healthcare industry is a real plus. But the reality is, Walgreens' fast moves are as much a product of need as much a desire to improve the business.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the improvements on the top line -- revenue was up 8% in the first half of the fiscal year -- non-pharmacy retail sales declined 5.3%. Management says that seasonality played some role in this, but they also lowered profit expectations for the full year, citing the competitive environment. I think those two things are more related than just seasonality.\n\nAt the same time, one of the company's biggest initiatives, healthcare, took another step backwards. Walgreens took a $5.8 billion impairment to its investment in VillageMD, reflecting much lower expectations for its full value over time. The upshot is that VillageMD revenues increased 20% last quarter, but the healthcare business continues to generate an operating loss.\n\nThis adds to Walgreens' cash flow woes. The company has burned $918 million in operating cash through the first half of the year, and spent $858 million on capital expenditures. That's a lot of money that has to come off the balance sheet to cover those checks.\n\nEven with promised expense and cost cuts, Walgreens has a lot of work to do. In the first six months of the fiscal year, its working capital has remained unchanged, but it has burned through some $11 billion in total assets on its balance sheet.\n\nAbout half of that is the VillageMD impairment, but what is easy to miss is that it has realized $1.7 billion in proceeds from the sale of its equity stake in Cencora so far this year, but Cencora's market value has increased enough to offset the impact of these sales on the balance sheet.\n\nAnd as measured by cash in and cash out, as generated by its operations, Walgreens is a long way from turnaround complete. That's particularly notable for income investors who may think the \"new\" dividend is safe. Barring a reversal in those cash flows, another cut is surely on the table.\n\nA better stock to buy instead\n\nWhether you're looking for steady income, a high yield, or a likely market-beater over the long term, Realty Income (NYSE: O) may be a better choice. As a starting point, its dividend is very secure, protected by strong cash flows from its tenants that rely on the properties they lease from Realty Income to generate their sales and profits.\n\nRealty Income is one of the largest net lease REITs -- it owns the real estate, while its tenants pay it rent, cover property taxes, and pay for improvements and maintenance -- in the world. Its tenants include Walgreens and competitor CVS Health, along with hundreds of other tenants in retailing, restaurants, experiential, and other e-commerce and macroeconomic resilient businesses.\n\nOne of the best capital allocators in real estate, Realty Income's business is built on creating value for its tenants and its investors, and growing the payout is a key tenet of its business model. It has increased its dividend not just every year since its 1994 IPO, but every quarter. It's also a monthly payer, a nice bonus for income investors.\n\nPut it all together, and you have a stronger business, a safer dividend, and a payout that's still growing. Did we mention the yield of 5.7% at recent prices is also better than Walgreens' 4.6% yield? There's that, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Realty Income wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Better Dividend Stock to Buy Now: Medtronic vs. Walgreens Boots Alliance",
        "content": "If you're an everyday investor looking for stocks that can deliver steadily rising dividend payouts over long periods, the healthcare sector is the right place to begin your search. People get sick during economic downturns just as often as they do when businesses are booming.\n\nMedtronic(NYSE: MDT) and Walgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA) are two dividend-paying giants of the healthcare sector. Both offer yields that are far more attractive than the paltry 1.4% yield you can receive from the average stock in the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nHere's a closer look at their recent performances to see which is most likely to deliver steadily growing payouts in the years ahead.\n\nThe case for Medtronic\n\nMedtronic's focus on developing new medical technology has served its shareholders well. The company has been able to raise its quarterly dividend payout for 46 consecutive years. The stock offers a 3.2% yield at recent prices.\n\nMedtronic's dividend payout has grown 146% over the past 10 years but that pace slowed down. The payout has grown just 9.5% over the past three years. MDT Dividend Chart\n\nMany of the devices Medtronic sells, such as pacemakers and spinal stimulators, aren't implanted into patients until after they jump through a lot of medical hoops. The COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench in the company's gearbox, but investors will be glad to learn that total sales are up 7% over the past three years.\n\nMedtronic sales and earnings have a strong chance to continue moving in the right direction. The company's product lineup has expanded significantly in recent months. During its fiscal third quarter that ended Jan. 26, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the company's new pulsed field ablation system and a new neurostimulator. More recently, the FDA approved the company's new aortic valve replacement system.\n\nThe case for Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nThe past several years have been difficult ones for Walgreens Boots Alliance shareholders. In a nutshell, the company's attempt to become more than a chain of retail pharmacies isn't working out. As a result, it reduced its dividend by 48% this year. At recent prices, the stock offers a 4.6% yield.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors who follow Walgreens closely will remember it had planned to launch 1,000 primary care practices in partnership with VillageMD, a joint venture partly owned by Cigna. Walgreens plowed billions into VillageMD but has nothing but losses to show for it. During Walgreens' fiscal second quarter that ended Feb. 29, the partners wrote down the value of VillageMD by $12.4 billion. WBA Dividend Chart\n\nWalgreens' portion of the latest VillageMD impairment charge worked out to $5.8 billion and led to a reported net loss of $5.9 billion in its fiscal second quarter. Even after adjusting for non-cash impairment charges, the company reported second-quarter operating income that sank 26.5% year over year to just $900 million.\n\nRetail pharmacies are increasingly at the whim of pharmacy benefits managers, or PBMs, that essentially determine how much they receive for dispensing prescription drugs. Without a PBM of its own, it's hard to see how Walgreens will grow its bottom line in the years ahead.\n\nThe better dividend stock to buy now\n\nWalgreens offers a higher yield, but shrinking profit margin in the retail pharmacy space could make growing its bottom line, and dividend payout, next to impossible over the long run.\n\nMedtronic's not growing as quickly as it used to, but developing new medical technology is a more lucrative endeavor than the troubled retail pharmacy business. With its dividend-raising streak still intact, and plenty of newly approved products to market, Medtronic looks like a much better dividend stock to buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Medtronic right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Medtronic, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Medtronic wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "13 High-Dividend Stocks to Invest In Under $10",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 high-dividend stocks to invest in under $10. You can skip our detailed analysis of high-dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 High-Dividend Stocks to Invest In Under $10.\n\nHigh dividend yields are always attractive, but seasoned investors know only focusing on yields could be dangerous.\u00a0 In fact, stocks with extremely high yields can be a warning sign, signaling underlying financial distress. This is what happened with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) earlier this year. The global pharmacy retail company was one of the highest-yielding stocks in the Dow, supporting a dividend yield of over 9% by November 2023 and boasting a 47-year streak of consistent dividend growth. However, the company\u2019s inherent financial challenges, stemming from low consumer spending throughout last year, compelled it to slash its dividend by half at the beginning of 2024. In the past 12 months, the stock has experienced a decline of over 36% and it currently has a dividend yield of 4.6%.\n\nThat said, this has not always been the case. High-yield dividend stocks with strong financial fundamentals can pull investors out of the perils of dividend cuts and suspensions. For that, investors need to look for companies that have consistently raised their dividends, which suggests strong cash generation and solid earnings growth. This way, investors can benefit from long-term capital appreciation while receiving consistent income. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) are popular in this regard as these companies come with years-long dividend growth track records while offering solid dividend yields.\n\nDividend growth strategies, combined with high yields, have also shown strong results over the years. For this analysis, we will take a look at the returns of The S&P Sector-Neutral High Yield Dividend Aristocrats (HYDA), which aims to create a balance between dividend growth and relatively higher yields. The evaluation of the index, conducted by S&P Dow Jones Indices, showed that the index\u2019s absolute return matched that of the S&P 500 from January 31, 2005 to July 31, 2023. The HYDA index also demonstrated lower overall volatility through the period, delivering improved risk-adjusted returns. The report also highlighted the index\u2019s tendency to act as a buffer against volatility. It highlighted that the index outperformed the benchmark when the VIX level exceeded 20, with the most significant performance occurring when the VIX level surpassed 30.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile analysts recommend focusing on dividend growth stocks offering stable yields, investing in dividend growers is one of the most effective ways to experience the compounding power of dividends. Dividend growers often have the potential to generate greater income in the long run compared to high-yield dividend stocks, as analyzed by S&P Dow Jones Indices. The dividend yield of a dividend grower may be lower at the beginning, but the combination of a growing dividend and an appreciating stock price can result in stronger total returns over the long run. Having resolved the caveats, we will now take a look at some of the best dividend stocks with high yields, priced under $10. 13 High-Dividend Stocks to Invest In Under $10\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we first used a stock screener to identify dividend-paying stocks priced below $10 and offering dividend yields above 6% as of March 30. From that selection, we chose 13 companies with strong dividend histories and ranked them in ascending order of their dividend yields, as recorded on March 30. We also mentioned hedge fund sentiment data for these stocks using Insider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds as of Q4 2023. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n13. Taitron Components Incorporated (NASDAQ:TAIT)\n\nDividend Yield as of March 30: 6.14%\n\nShare Price as of March 30: $3.26\n\nTaitron Components Incorporated (NASDAQ:TAIT) is an American manufacturing company that specializes in electronic components. The company's products also include transistors and integrated circuits. On February 2, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share, which fell in line with its previous dividend. It has been paying regular dividends to shareholders since 2016, which makes TAIT one of the best dividend stocks under $10. The stock has a dividend yield of 6.14%, as of March 30.\n\nAt the end of Q4 2023, Jim Simons' Renaissance Technologies was the only shareholder of Taitron Components Incorporated (NASDAQ:TAIT), owning stakes worth nearly $300,000.\n\n12. Crown Crafts, Inc. (NYSE:CRWS)\n\nDividend Yield as of March 30: 6.27%\n\nShare Price as of March 30: $5.10\n\nCrown Crafts, Inc.

        "title": "Walgreens CEO: 'We are on a mission to achieve provider status for our pharmacists'",
        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) CEO Tim Wentworth is changing the way the retail pharmacy chain operates in a bid to become a more clinically oriented brand \u2014 though without the clinics.\n\n\"We like where we are now, but we're not going to get to where we need to simply by being a place that can hire lots of pharmacists. It is about work redesign, it is about taking the lower-value work off the table,\" he told Yahoo Finance on Thursday.\n\nThe longtime healthcare executive is signaling a seismic shift in how the company operates, with an eye toward fewer verticals within the business. Wentworth, former CEO of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts, which was acquired by Cigna (CI) in 2018, previously announced 60 VillageMD closures. The co-located clinics and pharmacies were the result of a $5 billion Walgreens partnership in 2020 prior to Wentworth's arrival last year, and were part of a broader strategy to be more health services focused \u2014 similar to rival CVS's (CVS) Minute Clinic.\n\nThe clinics caused a nearly $6 billion drop in the company's second quarter revenue compared to the prior year, the company announced on Thursday. Still, Walgreens managed to beat earnings expectations, reporting earnings per share of $1.20 compared to analyst expectations of $0.82. The company's stock was up nearly 4% in trading Thursday.\n\nPharmacist roles\n\nIn its post-results earnings call, Wentworth noted that the National Health Service, the UK's health agency, recently began allowing pharmacists to diagnose and prescribe medication for seven common health conditions, including shingles, UTIs, and sore throats. Boots locations in the UK are part of this new program, which gives Wentworth access to firsthand data on how it works and how it could be replicated in the US.\n\n\"We are on a mission to achieve provider status for our pharmacists, given their influence, which was so clearly highlighted during the pandemic. This would allow them to get reimbursed for providing select services to patients,\" Wentworth said on the call regarding the US labor force.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"These are highly trained clinical professionals ... whose scope of practice goes well beyond dispensing medications,\" he added. Merchandise aisle at a Walgreens in Queens, N.Y. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) (UCG via Getty Images)\n\nHow the company can achieve this goal amid a nationwide shortage of pharmacists, as well as ongoing headwinds in the consumer space, is the challenge Wentworth faces.\n\nUS pharmacists, which are licensed by states, have varying degrees of medical authority depending on the state they practice in. Walgreens is in the midst of lobbying Congress to pass a bill with language that would allow Medicare Part B reimbursement for pharmacists providing tests, vaccines and treatments\u2014 but would not step on state laws, a spokesperson for Walgreens clarified after the interview Thursday.\n\nWentworth acknowledged the company has faced the same problems as other pharmacies in the past few years \u2014 including having to close down more than 100 locations and pausing the buildout of smaller locations in order to better manage resources.\n\nSince taking the helm, Wentworth says he has been focusing on a return to the basics. That means facing old problems \u2014 such as weak demand for front-of-store consumer items as more customers look to e-commerce and bulk buying amid inflationary pressure.\n\nTo that end, he recently announced internally that store managers will have more control over their stores and be incentivized to drive growth. In addition, creating a more community-based pharmacy setting \u2014 customizing the store based on the location rather than the current big box feel \u2014 on the front retail paired with the back end with \"pharmacists operating at the very top of their clinical ability\" is how Walgreens can survive the downward pressure it has faced in recent years, Wentworth said.\n\n\"That's the way we're able to grow our underlying clinical side of our business while at the same time building trust with patients,\" he said.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "title": "Walgreens\u2019 frail quarter goes beyond the discretionary spending dips afflicting its competitors. It\u2019s \u2018just not very good at retailing,\u2019 analyst says",
        "content": "Pharmacy chain Walgreens posted better-than-expected earnings on Thursday, but analysts are not confident in its ability to recover from a challenging few years of decreasing demand for COVID vaccines and treatments and increased retail competition.\n\nWalgreens beat earnings estimates, posting a 6.3% sales leap year over year to $37.1 billion, as well as a 3.4% earnings per share bump of $1.20. But the rest of the report tells the story of a more fragile company: It reported a $13.2 billion operating loss\u2014$12.4 billion of which was a noncash impairment charge, or write-off related to its primary care provider, VillageMD, which plans to shut down 160 unprofitable locations. The losses prompted Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, to call the earnings period \u201canother torrid quarter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile these things are technical adjustments, they underline the poor strategic decisions Walgreens has made over the past few years and its various misadventures in health care,\u201d Saunders wrote in a Thursday note. \u201cWith the focus of the business firmly on driving profitability under a new CEO, Walgreens has had to take a very big step back from operations that it used to see as central to its future.\u201d\n\nWalgreens anticipated some of its struggles, particularly including an earnings hit from its February sale of $992 million in shares of wholesale drug company Cencora, which pushed the company to lower the top end of its full-year adjusted earnings per share from $3.50 to $3.35. The company hopes to save $1 billion over the course of the year. CEO Tim Wentworth\u2014who took Walgreens\u2019 helm last October after a tumultuous period of staff walkouts over poor working conditions\u2014instead attributes Walgreens\u2019 future challenges to the retail side of the business, which has struggled because of consumers\u2019 unwillingness to buy discretionary items.\n\nWalgreens reported 4.7% sales growth on the pharmaceutical side of the business owing to rising inflation and drug costs, but a 4.5% total sales decline on the retail side. Deloitte\u2019s March ConsumerSignals report indicates that discretionary spending intentions are still below overall spending intentions, which have ebbed and flowed since recovery from the pandemic.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe count on folks to come in and to not only visit our pharmacies, but come in, buy impulse items, get last-minute items, get seasonal items,\u201d Wentworth told Bloomberg TV on Thursday. \u201cA lot of those things are purchases that you have to get the value equation right on or else they feel discretionary to folks.\u201d\n\nCompetitor CVS is having similar struggles. It, too, announced scale backs on primary care initiatives last fall after rising drug prices and a lessened demand for pandemic treatments slowed store traffic. Bankrupt Rite Aid, another drugstore chain, also closed a combined 1,500 stores. Plus, a weak respiratory illness season meant fewer people were buying tissues and over-the-counter medicine.\n\nRetail strategy changes\n\nTo be sure, Walgreens has taken bigger swings to attract cash-strapped customers. A Walgreens spokesperson told Fortune that the chain is \u201cresponding to these market dynamics by making investments in key value items, and focusing our capabilities to engage with customers in a very targeted way.\u201d Walgreens introduced 37 new store-brand products last quarter and is using stockkeeping unit rationalization to determine which products are more appealing to consumers.\n\nWhile customers are buying general merchandise at Walgreens for convenience, they are going elsewhere to find bargains, Saunders said. Walgreens has particularly been losing out in the beauty sector, where customers are willing to spend more money, but are turning to competitors like Target and Ulta, which offer larger selections and lower prices. Walgreens isn\u2019t lagging in retail sales because of shoppers unwilling to spend money, Saunders asserted. It is losing money because consumers are going elsewhere for better deals and products.\n\n\u201cBasically, Walgreens is losing out because it is just not very good at retailing,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Wentworth doubled down on the importance of brick-and-mortar Walgreens, saying on Thursday that its customer service is what separates it from e-commerce giants like Amazon.\n\n\u201cWe will beat Amazon because of the human interface that we offer in communities and neighborhoods,\u201d he told CNBC.\n\nSaunders told Fortune, however, that Walgreens is not known for its customer service, and because customers frequent Walgreens out of convenience, they often don\u2019t require high levels of help.\n\n\u201cWalgreens\u2019 view that this is an area of strength for the chain is a case of wishful thinking,\u201d Saunders said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Decoding Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) faces a complex financial landscape with significant restructuring costs and legal settlements impacting its financial statements. The company's strategic focus on healthcare services and omnichannel retailing positions it for potential growth amidst industry shifts. Legal challenges and market volatility present ongoing threats to WBA's operational stability and profitability.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with WBA.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA), a leading retail pharmacy chain, recently filed its 10-Q on March 28, 2024, revealing a multifaceted financial profile. The filing underscores the company's efforts to navigate a challenging market environment, marked by transformational cost management charges, legal settlements, and adjustments to equity earnings. Despite these hurdles, WBA's strategic initiatives in healthcare services and retail innovation suggest a forward-looking approach aimed at long-term growth. However, the company must contend with the volatility of derivative instruments and the impact of legal proceedings on its financial health. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in the latest SEC filing, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of WBA's current position and future prospects. Decoding Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nExtensive Retail Network and Brand Recognition: Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) boasts an expansive retail presence, with over 8,500 locations ensuring that nearly three-quarters of Americans live within five miles of a Walgreens store. This extensive network is a testament to the company's strong brand recognition and accessibility, which are crucial assets in the competitive retail pharmacy landscape. The brand's strength is further reinforced by its significant share of the U.S. prescription drug market, accounting for 20% of total prescription revenue. WBA's ability to generate consistent foot traffic and customer loyalty through its retail outlets is a formidable strength that underpins its market position.\n\nStory continues\n\nDiversified Revenue Streams: WBA's diversified business model, which includes prescription drug sales, general wellness products, European drug wholesale, and healthcare services, provides multiple revenue streams that mitigate the risks associated with market fluctuations in any single segment. The company's own branded merchandise and the integration of additional services like Health Corner and Village Medical enhance the customer experience and create an omnichannel presence. This diversification not only stabilizes WBA's financial performance but also offers cross-selling opportunities that can drive growth.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRestructuring Costs and Legal Settlements: The company's financials reflect significant restructuring costs associated with its Transformational Cost Management Program, which, while not indicative of current operating performance, do impact the bottom line. Additionally, WBA has faced substantial legal settlements, particularly related to opioid litigation and pricing disputes, which have necessitated considerable financial accruals. These non-operational expenses have the potential to divert resources away from strategic investments and innovation, thereby hindering WBA's competitive edge and financial agility.\n\nGoodwill Impairment and Inventory Valuation Challenges: WBA recognized impairment charges related to goodwill, intangibles, and long-lived assets, particularly within the VillageMD reporting unit. These charges, which are not part of the ordinary course of business, can skew the perception of the company's financial health. Furthermore, the use of the LIFO method for inventory accounting in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment introduces variability in cost of sales, which can be affected by external factors beyond the company's control, potentially leading to financial statement volatility.\n\nOpportunities\n\nHealthcare Services Expansion: WBA's strategic investments in healthcare, including its majority stake in VillageMD and partnerships with Shields and CareCentrix, position the company to capitalize on the growing demand for value-based care and integrated healthcare services. The expansion of its healthcare segment aligns with industry trends towards personalized, technology-enabled care delivery, offering WBA the opportunity to differentiate itself and capture new revenue sources in the evolving healthcare landscape.\n\nOmnichannel Retailing and Digital Transformation: The company's focus on creating an omnichannel experience for patients, through both digital and physical channels, is timely as consumer preferences shift towards convenience and online accessibility. WBA's efforts to enhance its digital capabilities and integrate them with its extensive retail network can attract a broader customer base, improve patient engagement, and drive sales across multiple platforms.\n\nThreats\n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks: WBA operates in a highly regulated industry and faces ongoing legal challenges, including those related to opioid dispensing and pricing practices. The outcomes of such proceedings can result in significant financial penalties and reputational damage, posing a threat to the company's operational stability and profitability. Moreover, changes in healthcare laws and regulations could impose additional compliance costs or alter the competitive landscape, impacting WBA's strategic positioning.\n\nMarket Volatility and Competitive Pressures: The company's financial performance is subject to market volatility, particularly in relation to derivative instruments used as economic hedges. Such volatility can lead to unpredictable gains or losses that do not reflect WBA's operational performance. Additionally, the retail pharmacy sector is highly competitive, with pressure from both traditional competitors and emerging online players. WBA must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its market share and profitability in the face of these competitive threats.\n\nIn conclusion, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) presents a SWOT profile characterized by a robust retail network and diversified business model, offset by financial challenges stemming from restructuring costs and legal settlements. Opportunities for growth in healthcare services and digital retailing are promising, yet the company must navigate legal risks and market volatility to realize its strategic potential. As WBA continues to adapt to industry trends and consumer demands, its ability to leverage its strengths and address its weaknesses will be critical to its success in the competitive landscape.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "If you\u2019re searching for cheap blue-chip stocks to buy, look no further. Blue-chip stocks continue to lag the performance of growth stocks. Although it is currently at an all-time high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, comprised of 30 blue-chip names, is up only 4% this year compared to an 11% gain in the technology-laden Nasdaq index. While some blue-chip stocks are performing strongly, many well-known companies are seeing their share price slide lower and badly lagging the market\u2019s overall performance. The declines, while notable, should be seen as a buying opportunity in many instances.\n\nSome of the stocks that are down this year are struggling with short-term issues that are beyond the company\u2019s control. In time, the situation should resolve itself and the share price should move higher. It\u2019s also good to have blue-chip stocks in one\u2019s portfolio as these securities can be defensive in times when the market drops or the economy falters. Plus, stalwart blue-chip stocks are more likely to pay dividends than fast-growing tech stocks and start-up companies. Buying when prices are down and riding them higher should be the goal of every investor.\n\nHere are seven blue-chip stocks to buy at or near their 52-week low in March.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: McDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nThe Golden Arches is as blue-chip as stocks come. The hamburger and restaurant chain has been a reliable performer for decades, trades at a reasonable 24 times future earnings estimates, and pays a quarterly dividend that yields a strong 2.40%. McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) has raised its dividend payment every year since 1976. Yet MCD stock has struggled in recent years. Year-to-date (YTD), the share price is down 6%. Over five years, it is up only 45%.\n\nThe softness in MCD stock is curious given that the company is in the midst of an aggressive growth strategy, with plans to open 9,000 new restaurant locations and add 100 million members to its loyalty rewards program by 2027. McDonald\u2019s also continues to diversify its menu, recently announcing that it will sell Krispy Kreme (NASDAQ:DNUT) doughnuts at its more than 13,500 restaurants across America.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut while news of the Krispy Kreme partnership sent DNUT stock up 30% in one day, it barely moved the needle on MCD stock. Time to buy the dip.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nArguably the best deal in the market right now is the stock of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The consumer electronics giant\u2019s share price is down nearly 10% on the year and not far from its 52-week low. Slowing sales in China and an antirust lawsuit filed against it by the U.S. Justice Department have pushed AAPL stock down since the start of the year. Smart investors will treat the decline as a buying opportunity.\n\nDespite the headwinds it faces, Apple continues to keep its business chugging along. In recent weeks, the company announced that it plans to start selling its new Vision Pro augmented reality headset in China. Also, Apple is reportedly in talks to license Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) technology from Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and integrate it into future iPhones.\n\nThe addition of AI sets up iPhone for potentially its biggest upgrade in years and could give the smartphone a whole new competitive advantage.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Lululemon Athletica (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall.

LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nA huge buy-the-dip opportunity has opened up with the stock of Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) after the company\u2019s latest earnings print. LULU stock fell more than 10% after the retailer issued weak forward guidance and said that its North American sales are slowing. The post-earnings decline has dragged the share price 23% lower year to date. However, this popular athletic apparel maker\u2019s stock is not likely to be down for long.\n\nWhile it is true that Lululemon\u2019s North American sales have decelerated, the company is killing it with its international expansion. For the final quarter of 2023, the company\u2019s international sales grew 54% year-over-year, with sales in the key market of China increasing 78%. Lululemon\u2019s total sales, North America included, were up 16% from a year ago. The strong international growth and overall growth are not reflected in LULU stock.\n\nLululemon also continues to expand beyond its traditional focus on women consumers, moving into men\u2019s wear and launching in February a new line of men\u2019s sneakers. Sneakers and casual footwear, both men\u2019s and women\u2019s, represent a huge new market for Lululemon Athletica.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nCan software company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) survive an existential threat posed by AI? That\u2019s the question facing the company as its share price has fallen 13% so far in 2024. ADBE stock began to sink after privately held OpenAI launched a new text-to-video generator that competes against its own creative software products that include Photoshop and Illustrator. The situation hasn\u2019t been helped by Adobe\u2019s latest earnings print.\n\nAdobe offered up forward guidance that disappointed analysts on Wall Street. The company also got dinged for canceling its planned $20 billion acquisition of design software start-up Figma and had to pay a $1 billion termination fee. The guidance and Figma fee overshadowed the fact that Adobe reported strong financial results that beat analyst forecasts. The company also announced a $25 billion stock buyback program.\n\nAdobe is not taking the threat from OpenAI and other competitors lying down. Over the last year, the company has added AI features to many of its software products, including an image editing tool called Firefly.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Hershey (HSY) The entrance to the Hershey factory in downtown Hershey, Pennsylvania. HSY stock.\n\nSource: George Sheldon / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe\u2019re heading into the Easter long weekend, and one would assume that this would be a great time to be a shareholder of Hershey Co. (NYSE:HSY). After all, Americans spent $3.3 billion on Easter chocolate and candy in 2023, up 8.2% from the previous year. Sadly though, there is not much reason to celebrate the Easter Bunny\u2019s arrival this year. Not with cocoa prices trading at an all-time high and above $10,000 per metric ton for the first time ever.\n\nRecord prices for cocoa is a huge problem for Hershey, which spends more than $1 billion a year on the active ingredient in chocolate. Cocoa prices have risen 40% this year due to global supply constraints. The problem lies in the Ivory Coast of Africa, which is the biggest cocoa producer in the world. The region has been hit by both flooding and hotter-than-usual temperatures that are causing drought conditions and diminishing crop yields.\n\nThe flooding and excessive heat has also led to an outbreak of cacao swollen shoot virus that is harming the cocoa crop. The world\u2019s supply of cocoa is now on course for a third straight annual supply deficit. The worsening problem has HSY stock down 24% over the last 12 months and not far from its 52-week low. But long-term, Hershey remains a solid investment. Here\u2019s hoping cocoa prices move lower before Halloween.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe\u2019re barely through one quarter of the year, and already 2024 has been tough on pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). In early January, the company cut its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by nearly 50%, sending WBA stock plunging. Then, the company was kicked out of the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and replaced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), further hurting its share price.\n\nThe net effect is that WBA stock is down 23% on the year. That brings its 12-month decline to nearly 40%. While things look dark for Walgreens, there are some faint glimmers of light starting to shine on the company and its stock. The company has a new CEO named Tim Wentworth who took the helm in October of last year. He has already undertaken a turnaround plan that included cutting the dividend to strengthen the company\u2019s balance sheet and preserve cash.\n\nAdditionally, Walgreens\u2019 most recent earnings beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines. The strong print was a reversal for Walgreens, which had missed earnings estimates in the two previous quarters. It will take time, but WBA stock could come back.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nHow low can Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock go? A lot lower according to analysts who cover the company. Down nearly 30% on the year, TSLA stock is currently the worst performer in the S&P 500 index. However, each day seems to bring a new analyst downgrade for the stock. Most recently, analysts at Bernstein lowered their price target on Tesla\u2019s shares to $120 from $150 and reiterated a \u201csell\u201d equivalent rating.\n\nBernstein, and others, are worried about slumping global demand for Tesla\u2019s electric vehicles, especially in China. They\u2019re also seeing weak demand for Tesla\u2019s Model 3 electric vehicle stateside. The piling on has hurt investor sentiment related to TSLA stock and pushed the share price lower. Approaching a 52-week low, and with its market capitalization sliding to $500 billion, its fair to wonder, what\u2019s next for Tesla?\n\nDespite the glum situation, there\u2019s every reason for investors to buy-the-dip in TSLA stock. The company is taking steps to right the ship, including raising prices and offering a free trial of its full self-driving feature. Also, the stock has fallen sharply in the past and always comes roaring back. This time is likely to be no different.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in AAPL and GOOGL.

So there's money that is wanting to be spent in a variety of different ways,\" said George Young, portfolio manager at Villere & Company in New Orleans.\n\n\"And then you've got that carrot that the Fed's kind of holding out there saying, we may just be lowering and we may just be lowering, and everybody's trying to parse their words.\"\n\nWhile U.S. equity markets will be closed for the Good Friday holiday, the focus will be on the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, for clues on the timing and size of rate cuts this year from the central bank.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 47.29 points, or 0.12%, to 39,807.37, the S&P 500 gained 5.86 points, or 0.11%, to 5,254.35 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 20.06 points, or 0.12%, to 16,379.46.\n\nFor the week, the Dow rose 0.84%, the S&P 500 advanced 0.39% and the Nasdaq slipped 0.3%. In March, the Dow climbed 2.08%, the S&P gained 3.1% and the Nasdaq added 1.79%. For the quarter, the Dow gained 5.62%, the S&P 500 shot up 10.16% and the Nasdaq rallied 9.11%.\n\nOvernight, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said recent disappointing inflation data affirms the case for the central bank to hold off on cutting its short-term interest rate target, but did not rule out trimming rates later in the year.\n\nMarkets are pricing in a roughly 64% chance the Fed will cut rates by at least 25 basis points (bps) in June, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.\n\nWhile communication services, energy and tech were the best performing of the 11 major sectors this quarter, only real estate suffered a decline.\n\nWalgreens Boots shares rose 3.19% after its quarterly earnings in which it recorded an impairment charge on its investment in clinic operator VillageMD.\n\nHome Depot slipped 0.59% after the home improvement retailer said it would buy building materials supplier SRS Distribution in an $18.25 billion deal in its largest acquisition.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.87-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.42-to-1 ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 91 new 52-week highs and no new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 275 new highs and 52 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 11.17 billion shares, compared with the 12.07 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\n\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak;)",

        "content": "Like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) is going for its piece of the healthcare pie. With its fiscal second quarter report, it topped estimates, but lowered the higher end of its full-year adjusted earnings guidance in response to a challenging macroeconomy. The\u00a0new CEO, Tim Wentworth,\u00a0continues to navigate the company out of a rough spot by slashing costs and solidifying the leadership team, but the company's healthcare transformation took its toll on the bottom line.\n\nFiscal second quarter highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on February 29th, Walgreens recorded sales grew about\u00a06.3% to\u00a0$37.05\u00a0billion, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$35.86 billion\u00a0as sales grew\u00a0across its three business segments. U.S. retail pharmacy segment brought in $28.86 billion as revenue grew almost 5%.\n\nWhat particularly stood up is the\u00a0U.S. health-care division\u00a0whose sales expanded\u00a033%\u00a0YoY to\u00a0$2.18 billion, owed to\u00a0VillageMD\u2019s acquisition of multispecialty care provider Summit Health\u00a0and business growth on a pro-forma basis. Same clinic growth fueled\u00a0VillageMD sales\u00a0which grew\u00a020%. New contracts and current partnershuip expansions fueled the segment\u2019s specialty pharmacy company,\u00a0Shields Health Solutions,\u00a0to\u00a013%\u00a0growth.\n\nAdjusted earnings of\u00a0$1.20\u00a0also topped LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a082 cents.\n\nBut due to a hefty nearly $6 billion charge related to the decline in value of its investment in primary-care provider VillageMD, Walgreens posted a\u00a0steep net loss\u00a0of\u00a0\u00a0$5.91 billion, or $6.85 per share,\u00a0swinging from last year\u2019s comparable quarter for which it made a net income of $703 million, or 81 cents per share.\n\nThe net loss reflected the hefty cost Walgreens is paying for its transformation\u00a0from\u00a0being a\u00a0major drugstore chain into\u00a0becoming a\u00a0large health-care\u00a0company. However,\u00a0CFO Manmohan Mahajan\u00a0emphasized that\u00a0VillageMD chargeis not expected to\u00a0have a significant impact on\u00a0the company\u2019s\u00a0financial position, or\u00a0its\u00a0ability to invest across businesses going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nOutlook\n\nWalgreens narrowed its prior fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings guidance\u00a0range from\u00a0$3.20\u00a0to\u00a0$3.35 per share, lowering the higher end from\u00a0$3.50 per share\u00a0due to hurdles retailers are facing amid an unfavorable economy, among other factors.\n\nWalgreens is reshaping its strategy along the way.\n\nWalgreens has been having a hard time over the last few years, and the battle is to become even harder with Amazon announcing its entry into the immediate delivery pharmacy market.\u00a0Amazon announced the expansion of same day delivery service for Amazon Pharmacy in New York and Los Angeles. But, getting a piece of the $4.5 trillion healthcare industry doesn\u2019t not come easy even for Amazon. Even the mighty e-commerce titan found its primary care strategy difficult to scale.\n\nLast year, Walgreens shares tanked 30% last year in response to plummeting\u00a0demand for Covid products, low pharmacy reimbursement rates,\u00a0along with its\u00a0unsteady push into health care\u00a0amid an unstable U.S. economy. With the ongoing cost savings program that includes trimming its workforce, closing unprofitable stores and using AI to boost the efficiency of its supply chain, Walgreens reiterated it is on track to\u00a0meet its goal of saving $1 billion during fiscal 2024, as it continues seeking\u00a0innovative ways to boost profitability and growth\u00a0of its\u00a0retail pharmacy division. With Amazon\u2019s latest move, Walgreens\u2019 challenges only got worse.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "*\n\nComm services, tech best performing sectors for the quarter\n\n*\n\nUS fourth-quarter growth revised up; weekly jobless claims fall\n\n*\n\nWalgreens gains after quarterly earnings\n\n*\n\nIndexes: Dow up 0.06%, S&P up 0.09%, Nasdaq down 0.13%\n\n(Updated at 2:20 p.m. ET/ 1820 GMT)\n\nBy Chuck Mikolajczak\n\nNEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks held near the unchanged mark on Thursday, with the S&P 500 poised to notch its best first quarter performance since 2019, as investors digested the latest batch of economic data while looking towards then next inflation reading.\n\nEach of the three main U.S. indexes were set for solid quarterly gains, led by a climb of more than 10% for the S&P 500, aided by as optimism over artificial intelligence (AI) related stocks and expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin to cut interest rates this year.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow sat less than 1% away from breaching the 40,000 level for the first time.\n\nData on Thursday showed the U.S. economy grew faster than previously estimated in the fourth quarter, partly due to strong consumer spending, while a separate report showed initial jobless claims indicated the labor market remains on solid footing.\n\nWhile U.S. equity markets will be closed for the Good Friday holiday, the focus will be on the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, for clues on the timing and size of rate cuts this year from the central bank.\n\n\"Without a growth contraction it's going to be difficult for the Fed to reach its 2% target this year so volatility around that repricing is likely to tick higher,\" said Dylan Kremer, chief investment officer at Certuity in Miami.\n\n\"But as long as the economic activity remains robust and labor markets remain robust the US consumer will remain active and continue to buoy demand which should continue to support prices.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 21.66 points, or 0.06%, to 39,781.74, the S&P 500 gained 4.51 points, or 0.09%, to 5,253.00 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 22.14 points, or 0.13%, to 16,377.29.\n\nStory continues\n\nOvernight, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said recent disappointing inflation data affirms the case for the central bank to hold off on cutting its short-term interest rate target, but did not rule out trimming rates later in the year.\n\nMarkets are pricing in a roughly 64% chance the Fed will cut rates by at least 25 basis points (bps) in June, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.\n\nWhile the communication services and tech are the best performing of the 11 major sectors this quarter, only real estate is on pace to record a decline.\n\nWalgreens Boots shares rose 3.64% after its quarterly earnings in which it recorded an impairment charge on its investment in clinic operator VillageMD.\n\nHome Depot slipped 0.57% after the home improvement retailer said it would buy building materials supplier SRS Distribution in an $18.25 billion deal in its largest acquisition.\n\nEstee Lauder jumped 6.52% after BofA Global Research upgraded the cosmetics giant's rating to \"buy\" from \"neutral\".\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.99-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.5-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 84 new 52-week highs and no new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 250 new highs and 45 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Aurora Ellis)",

        "title": "Walgreens books hefty charge as the drugstore chain adjusts the value of struggling clinics",
        "content": "Walgreens lost nearly $6 billion in its second quarter mainly due to a drop in value for the VillageMD clinic business it controls.\n\nExcluding that charge, the drugstore chain reported results Thursday that topped Wall Street expectations.\n\nWalgreens spent more than $5 billion a few years ago to acquire a majority stake in VillageMD and launch a plan to add hundreds of clinics to its stores and grow its ability to provide care.\n\nBut the drugstore chain said Thursday that it recorded a $5.8 billion, after-tax impairment charge for VillageMD in its most recent quarter as it adjusted the asset\u2019s value.\n\nVillageMD says on its website that it runs 680 locations. It specializes in clinics that deliver value-based care. That approach, which is growing popular with some insurers, essentially rewards doctors for keeping patients healthy instead of paying them for every service they perform.\n\nThe company is dealing with slower-than-expected growth in patients and changes to reimbursement from the federal government\u2019s Medicare program, among other challenges. Walgreens executives said Thursday that VillageMD is closing around 160 clinics, or 100 more than it previously announced.\n\nA Walgreens spokesman declined to say how many clinics were attached to the company\u2019s drugstores.\n\nWalgreens announced its VillageMD partnership in 2020. Company leaders said then that they wanted to provide more comprehensive care to customers than what they offered in smaller clinics typically tucked in the back of its stores.\n\nThe company also said it expected to open 500 to 700 primary care clinics in 30 markets over the next five years.\n\nBut the drugstore chain has since changed CEOs. New leader Tim Wentworth has turned the company\u2019s focus more to cutting costs and improving profitability.\n\nThat has led Walgreens \u201cto take a very big step back from operations that it used to see as central to its future,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData.\n\n\u201cWhile Walgreens is not giving up on healthcare, the shutting of unprofitable primary care facilities cannot be seen as anything but a temporary retreat,\u201d Saunders said in an email.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalgreens said on Thursday that it booked adjusted earnings of $1.20 per share in its fiscal second quarter as sales grew 6% to $37.1 billion.\n\nAnalysts expected earnings of 82 cents per share on $35.86 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.\n\nWalgreens also said it was narrowing its forecast for fiscal 2024 to adjusted earnings of $3.20 to $3.35 per share.\n\nAnalysts predict $3.24 per share.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc., based outside of Chicago in Deerfield, Illinois, runs around 13,000 drugstores globally. Most of its locations are in the United States.\n\nCompany shares rose 8 cents to $21.10 Thursday.",

        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. WBA delivered adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.20 in second-quarter fiscal 2024, surging 3.4% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure (up 2.8% at constant exchange rate or CER). The figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 46.3%.\n\nGAAP loss per share for second-quarter fiscal 2024 was $6.85 compared with the year-ago quarter\u2019s EPS of 81 cents.\n\nTotal Sales\n\nWalgreens Boots recorded total sales of $37.05 billion in the fiscal second quarter, up 6.3% year over year and 5.7% at CER. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.3%.\n\nQuarterly Details\n\nThe company currently operates its business into three reportable segments \u2014 U.S. Retail Pharmacy, International and U.S. Healthcare.\n\nU.S. Retail Pharmacy\n\nThe segment\u2019s sales totaled $28.9 billion in the fiscal second quarter, up 4.7% year over year.\n\nComparable sales increased 4.8% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s levels.\n\nPharmacy sales were up 8.2% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figures and comparable pharmacy sales increased 8.7%, benefiting from higher branded drug inflation and strong execution in pharmacy services.\n\nRetail sales fell 4.5% and comparable retail sales were down 4.3% year over year, reflecting a challenging retail environment, channel shift, and a weaker respiratory season, including a 170 basis point impact from lower seasonal and general merchandise sales, a 90 basis point direct impact from softer cold cough flu trends, and a 40 basis point impact from adverse January weather.\n\nInternational\n\nRevenues in the International division rose 6.6% on a year-over-year basis and increased 3.2% at CER to $6.00 billion in the fiscal second quarter.\n\nBoots UK sales rose 3% year over year. In Germany, wholesale business sales increased 5.3% in the fiscal second quarter.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote\n\nStory continues\n\nBoots UK\u2019s comparable retail sales increased 1.7%. However, Boots UK\u2019s comparable pharmacy sales rose 5.9% year over year.\n\nU.S. Healthcare\n\nU.S. Healthcare reported fiscal second-quarter revenues of $2.20 billion. The metric was up 14% on a pro-forma basis from the year-ago quarter\u2019s levels, led by VillageMD and Shields.\n\nWithin the segment, the Shields business rose 13%, driven by recent contract wins and further expansion of existing partnerships.\n\nVillageMD rose 20% on a pro-forma basis, reflecting the same clinic growth and additional full-risk lives under management.\n\nMargins\n\nGross profit in the reported quarter fell 0.2% year over year to $7.04 billion. Gross margin contracted 124 bps to 19%.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses fell 14.2% year over year to $7.92 billion.\n\nThe company reported an adjusted operating loss of $881 million for the quarter compared with an operating profit of $121 million in the year-ago period.\n\nFinancial Condition\n\nWalgreens Boots exited the second quarter of fiscal 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of $668 million compared with $784 million recorded in first-quarter fiscal 2024. The total debt was $9.47 billion at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2024, up from $9.28 billion at first-quarter fiscal 2024.\n\nNet cash used by operating activities at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2024 was $918 million compared with the year-ago period\u2019s cash inflow of $1.24 billion.\n\nThe company has a five-year annualized dividend growth rate of 1.75%.\n\nFiscal 2024 Guidance\n\nThe company narrowed its 2024 EPS guidance.\n\nAdjusted EPS guidance is now expected in the $3.20-$3.35 range (down from the previous guidance of $3.20- $3.50). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.23.\n\nOur Take\n\nWalgreens Boots exited second-quarter fiscal 2024 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company\u2019s U.S. Healthcare business grew, led by key contract wins and continued partnership growth. During the reported quarter, VillageMD registered strong growth, reflecting existing clinic growth and additional full-risk lives under management. The company remains confident in its goal of achieving $1 billion in cost savings in 2024.\n\nHowever, operating cash flow was negatively impacted by payments related to legal matters, Boots Pension Plan Annuity premium, and underlying seasonality. Escalating costs and the contraction of gross margin are a concern.\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nWalgreens Boots currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are Stryker Corporation SYK, Cencora, Inc. COR and Cardinal Health CAH.\n\nStryker, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reported a fourth-quarter 2023 adjusted EPS of $3.46, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.8%.

        "content": "Revenue: Q2 sales increased by 6.3% to $37.1 billion, exceeding estimates. Net Income: Reported a net loss of $5.9 billion due to non-cash impairment charges, contrasted with net earnings of $703 million in the prior year. Earnings Per Share (EPS): Adjusted EPS at $1.20, up 3.4% and surpassing the estimated $0.8165. Challenges: Faced a significant non-cash impairment charge related to VillageMD goodwill.

U.S. Healthcare: Achieved adjusted EBITDA profitability for the first time, signaling growth potential. Free Cash Flow: Negative free cash flow reported, impacted by legal payments and seasonality.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with WBA.\n\nOn March 28, 2024, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) released its quarterly earnings, providing insights into its financial health and operational challenges. The company reported a 6.3% increase in Q2 sales to $37.1 billion, outperforming analyst revenue estimates of $35.9 billion. However, the quarter was marked by a substantial net loss of $5.9 billion, primarily due to a $12.4 billion non-cash impairment charge related to VillageMD goodwill. This starkly contrasts with the net earnings of $703 million in the same quarter of the previous year. Despite the net loss, WBA's adjusted EPS of $1.20 exceeded the estimated $0.8165, reflecting a 3.4% increase year-over-year. For a detailed view of the company's financial performance, readers can access the 8-K filing. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA) Earnings: A Mixed Bag Amid Impairment Charges\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, a leading retail pharmacy chain in the U.S., operates over 8,500 locations nationwide. The company's portfolio includes a significant presence in prescription drug sales, which accounts for two-thirds of its revenue, and a growing omnichannel experience in healthcare services.\n\nFinancial Performance and Challenges\n\nWBA's U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment saw a 4.7% increase in sales, yet faced a decrease in adjusted operating income due to lower retail sales and other factors. The International segment experienced a sales increase but also a decline in adjusted operating income, mainly due to the absence of real estate gains from the prior year. The U.S. Healthcare segment, however, marked a significant milestone, achieving positive adjusted EBITDA for the first time, driven by growth from VillageMD and Shields.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe challenges presented by the impairment charges are significant, reflecting the need for strategic reviews and cost-saving initiatives. CEO Tim Wentworth expressed confidence in achieving $1 billion in cost savings for the year and emphasized the company's focus on customer engagement and value in a difficult retail environment.\n\nStrategic Implications\n\nThe earnings report highlights WBA's financial achievements amidst a tough quarter. The adjusted EPS beat is particularly important as it suggests operational efficiency and resilience in a challenging market. The positive adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. Healthcare segment is a promising sign of WBA's strategic shift towards healthcare services and its potential for long-term growth.\n\nThe company's performance is crucial for investors, especially in the context of the healthcare providers and services industry. WBA's strategic moves, including a focus on cost savings and portfolio reviews, are aimed at driving growth and delivering value amidst a changing healthcare landscape.\n\nIn conclusion, while Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) faced significant challenges this quarter, the company's strategic initiatives and focus on healthcare services position it for potential growth. The earnings report, with its mixed results, underscores the importance of strategic agility in the evolving retail and healthcare sectors.\n\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc for further details.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.20 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.82 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.16 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 46.34%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this largest U.S. drugstore chain would post earnings of $0.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.66, delivering a surprise of 4.76%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nWalgreens , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, posted revenues of $37.05 billion for the quarter ended February 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.29%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $34.86 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nWalgreens shares have lost about 19.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 10%.\n\nWhat's Next for Walgreens?\n\nWhile Walgreens has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Walgreens: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.88 on $35.77 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.23 on $144.88 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores is currently in the bottom 8% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\neBay (EBAY), another stock in the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector, has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024.\n\nThis e-commerce company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\neBay's revenues are expected to be $2.53 billion, up 0.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Leroy Leo and Puyaan Singh\n\n(Reuters) -Walgreens Boots Alliance recorded a $5.8 billion impairment charge on its investment in clinic operator VillageMD on Thursday, hit by a cost-cutting drive to shut down unprofitable sites.\n\nVillageMD, a core part of Walgreens' push to expand beyond its legacy pharmacy operations, plans to shut over 160 clinics to focus on sites present in densely populated areas, to increase the number of patients treated by a single doctor.\n\nThat, along with slower-than-expected growth of patients per doctor, led to a lower long-term forecast for the business, Walgreens executives said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe company, which has invested over $6 billion over the last few years in VillageMD, has been looking to integrate clinics into its traditional drugstores.\n\nThat aligns with new CEO Tim Wentworth's focus on cutting costs to turn around a sagging share price and rebound from a post-pandemic hit to sales from lower demand for COVID tests and shots.\n\nWentworth said the company was now \"reviewing every business through a longer-term lens\" to focus on cost savings and strategic fit.\n\nWalgreens reported a net loss of $5.9 billion for the quarter ended Feb. 29, mainly due to the impairment charge.\n\nIt also cut the higher end of its profit forecast for fiscal-year 2024, citing economic challenges in its retail operations.\n\nShares of the company, which have declined around 19% this year, were up 1% in volatile morning trading.\n\nJeff Jonas, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said the company may not see a turnaround till maybe 2026, considering the financial pressures it faces. The fund owns a less than 1% stake in the company.\n\n\"The valuation is really low (and) the dividend is good. So we're getting paid to wait. And maybe the new CEO comes up with something even more creative,\" Jonas said.\n\nExcluding the charge and other one-time items, Walgreens reported earnings of $1.20 per share for the quarter, compared with analysts' average estimate of 82 cents per share, according to LSEG data.\n\nIt now expects an adjusted profit of $3.20 to $3.35 per share for its financial year ending Aug. 31, versus its previous range of $3.20 to $3.50 per share.\n\n(Reporting by Puyaan Singh and Leroy Leo in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)",

Operating loss in the quarter includes a $12.4 billion non-cash impairment charge related to VillageMD goodwill, which resulted in a $5.8 billion charge attributable to WBA, net of tax and non-controlling interest. Operating loss also reflects a $455 million non-cash impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. Adjusted operating income** was $900 million, a decrease of 26.5 percent on a constant currency basis reflecting lower sale-leaseback gains and softer U.S. retail performance, partly offset by improved profitability in the U.S. Healthcare segment.\n\nNet loss in the second quarter was $5.9 billion compared to net earnings of $703 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting non-cash impairment charges. Adjusted net earnings** increased 3.5 percent to $1.0 billion, up 3.0 percent on a constant currency basis, as lower adjusted operating income** was more than offset by the lower adjusted effective tax rate** compared to the year-ago quarter due to the recognition of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions.\n\nLoss per share in the second quarter was $6.85 compared to earnings per share of $0.81 in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EPS** increased 3.4 percent to $1.20, reflecting an increase of 2.8 percent on a constant currency basis.\n\nNet cash used for operating activities was $637 million in the second quarter. Operating cash flow was negatively impacted by $615 million in payments related to legal matters, a $379 million Boots Pension Plan Annuity premium, and underlying seasonality. Year-over-year cash flow was negatively impacted by payments related to legal matters, phasing of working capital, and lower earnings. Free cash flow** was negative $610 million, a $1.3 billion decrease compared with the year-ago quarter. Capital expenditures decreased by $146 million compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nOverview of Fiscal 2024 Year-to-Date Results\n\nSales in the first six months of fiscal 2024 increased 8.1 percent from the year-ago period to $73.8 billion, an increase of 7.2 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across all segments.\n\nOperating loss in the first six months of fiscal 2024 was $13.2 billion compared to an operating loss of $6.0 billion in the year-ago period. Operating loss reflects a $12.4 billion non-cash impairment charge related to VillageMD goodwill, which resulted in a $5.8 billion charge attributable to WBA, net of tax and non-controlling interest. Operating loss in the current period also reflects a $455 million non-cash impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. Prior year operating loss reflects a $6.8 billion pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation. Adjusted operating income** was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 29.5 percent on a constant currency basis reflecting softer U.S. retail performance and lower sale-leaseback gains, partly offset by improved profitability in the U.S. Healthcare segment.\n\nNet loss for the first six months of fiscal 2024 was $6.0 billion compared to net loss of $3.0 billion in the year-ago period, reflecting the non-cash impairment charges. Adjusted net earnings** decreased 19.8 percent to $1.6 billion, down 20.4 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting lower adjusted operating income** partly offset by a lower adjusted effective tax** rate due to the recognition of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions.\n\nLoss per share for the first six months of fiscal 2024 was $6.93 compared to loss per share of $3.50 in the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS** decreased 19.9 percent to $1.86, reflecting a decrease of 20.5 percent on a constant currency basis.\n\nNet cash used for operating activities was negative $918 million in the first six months of fiscal 2024. Operating cash flow was negatively impacted by $699 million in payments related to legal matters, a $379 million Boots Pension Plan Annuity premium, and underlying seasonality. Year-over-year cash flow was adversely impacted by phasing of working capital, lower earnings, and payments related to legal matters. Free cash flow** was negative $1.4 billion, a $2.0 billion decrease compared with the year-ago period. Capital expenditures decreased by $250 million compared to the year-ago period.\n\nBusiness Segments\n\nU.S. Retail Pharmacy\n\nThree months ended Six months ended February 29, 2024 February 28, 2023 February 29, 2024 February 28, 2023 Sales $ 28,861 $ 27,577 $ 57,805 $ 54,781 Adjusted operating income *** $ 752 $ 1,067 $ 1,446 $ 2,172\n\nThe U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment had second quarter sales of $28.9 billion, an increase of 4.7 percent from the year-ago quarter. Comparable sales increased 4.8 percent from the year-ago quarter.\n\nPharmacy sales increased 8.2 percent compared to the year-ago quarter. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 8.7 percent in the quarter compared to the year-ago quarter, benefiting from higher branded drug inflation and strong execution in pharmacy services. Comparable prescriptions filled in the second quarter, adjusted to 30-day equivalents increased 2.7 percent from the year-ago quarter while comparable prescriptions excluding immunizations increased 2.9 percent. Total prescriptions filled in the quarter, including immunizations, adjusted to 30-day equivalents was 305.7 million, an increase of 2.6 percent versus the prior year quarter.\n\nRetail sales decreased 4.5 percent and comparable retail sales decreased 4.3 percent compared with the year-ago quarter, reflecting a challenging retail environment, channel shift, and a weaker respiratory season, including a 170 basis point impact from lower seasonal and general merchandise sales, a 90 basis point direct impact from softer cold cough flu trends, and a 40 basis point impact from adverse January weather.\n\nAdjusted operating income** decreased 29.5 percent to $752 million compared to $1.1 billion in the year-ago quarter, reflecting lower retail sales, lower sale-leaseback gains, and higher shrink levels, partially offset by cost savings compared to the prior year quarter.\n\nInternational\n\nThree months ended Six months ended February 29, 2024 February 28, 2023 February 29, 2024 February 28, 2023 Sales $ 6,022 $ 5,651 $ 11,854 $ 10,840 Adjusted operating income *** $ 245 $ 352 $ 387 $ 468\n\nThe International segment had second quarter sales of $6.0 billion, an increase of 6.6 percent from the year-ago quarter, including a favorable currency impact of 3.4 percent. Sales increased 3.2 percent on a constant currency basis, with the Germany wholesale business growing 5.3 percent and Boots UK sales growing 3.0 percent.\n\nBoots UK comparable pharmacy sales increased 1.7 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Boots UK comparable retail sales increased 5.9 percent compared to the year-ago quarter with growth across all categories, and increased total retail market share. Boots.com continued to perform strongly with sales growing 16.8 percent representing over 17 percent of Boots total retail sales.\n\nAdjusted operating income decreased 30.3 percent to $245 million, a decrease of 32.4 percent on a constant currency basis compared with the year-ago quarter, entirely due to lapping real estate gains in the year-ago period. Underlying growth offset inflationary pressures.\n\nU.S. Healthcare\n\nThree months ended Six months ended February 29, 2024 February 28, 2023 February 29, 2024 February 28, 2023 Sales $ 2,176 $ 1,634 $ 4,107 $ 2,622 Operating loss $ (13,059 ) $ (472 ) $ (13,494 ) $ (909 ) Adjusted operating loss *** $ (34 ) $ (159 ) $ (129 ) $ (311 ) Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP measure) $ 17 $ (109 ) $ (22 ) $ (233 )\n\nThe U.S. Healthcare segment had second quarter sales of $2.2 billion, an increase of 33.2 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, aided by the acquisition of Summit Health by VillageMD. On a pro forma basis, the segment's businesses grew sales at a combined rate of 14 percent in the quarter, led by VillageMD and Shields. VillageMD grew 20 percent on a pro forma basis, reflecting same clinic growth and additional full-risk lives under management. Shields grew 13 percent, driven by recent contract wins and further expansion of existing partnerships.\n\nOperating loss was $13.1 billion, due to the non-cash impairment charge related to VillageMD goodwill. Adjusted operating loss**, which excludes impairment charges, stock compensation expense, and amortization of acquired intangible assets, was $34 million compared to $159 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA** of $17 million improved by $127 million versus the prior year quarter and represents the first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA** for the segment, driven by growth from VillageMD and Shields, and continued cost discipline.\n\nConference Call\n\nWBA will hold a conference call to discuss the second quarter results beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time today, March 28, 2024. A live simulcast as well as related presentation materials will be available through WBA\u2019s investor relations website at: https://investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com. A replay of the conference will be archived on the website for at least 12 months after the event.\n\n*All references to net earnings or net loss are to net earnings or net loss attributable to WBA, and all references to EPS are to diluted EPS attributable to WBA.\n\n**\"Adjusted,\" \"constant currency\" and free cash flow amounts are non-GAAP financial measures.

AND SUBSIDIARIES SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nThe following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the SEC rules, presented in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures in the press release, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThese supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the Company\u2019s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in the Company\u2019s historical operating results. The Company also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a basis for certain compensation programs it sponsors. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release.\n\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company\u2019s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as unusual one-time charges, tax expenses, and material litigation expenses, and that would impact diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\n\nConstant currency\n\nThe Company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in \"constant currency,\" which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The Company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the U.S. reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and such presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nComparable sales\n\nFiscal 2024 second-quarter comparable sales and prescriptions filled figures for the Company exclude the benefit of this year's leap day.\n\nFor the Company's U.S. Retail Pharmacy and International segments, Comparable sales are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. Comparable sales in constant currency exclude wholesale sales in Germany and sales from dispositions in the current period. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry and our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers\u2019 methods.\n\nWith respect to the International segment, comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales and comparable retail sales, are presented on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the discussion above in \"Constant currency\" for further details on constant currency calculations.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nThe Company considers certain metrics, such as comparable sales (in constant currency), comparable pharmacy sales (in constant currency), comparable retail sales (in constant currency), comparable number of prescriptions, comparable prescriptions excluding immunizations, and comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions to be key performance indicators because the Company\u2019s management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.\n\nNET (LOSS) EARNINGS TO ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED NET (LOSS) EARNINGS PER SHARE TO ADJUSTED DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (in millions, except per share amounts) Three months ended Six months ended February 29,\r\n2024 February 28,\r\n2023 February 29,\r\n2024 February 28,\r\n2023 Net (loss) earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, developed technology and contract intangibles. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company\u2019s GAAP financial statements. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP measures. Amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired, or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. The stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustment reflects the difference between the fair value based remeasurement of awards under purchase accounting and the grant date fair valuation. Post-acquisition compensation expense recognized in excess of the original grant date fair value of acquiree awards are excluded from the related non-GAAP measures as these arise from acquisition-related accounting requirements or agreements, and are not reflective of normal operating activities. 2 Acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities recorded in Operating (loss) income within the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Earnings. Examples of such costs include deal costs, severance, stock-based compensation, employee transaction success bonuses, and other integration related exit and disposal charges. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. These costs are significantly impacted by the timing and complexity of the underlying merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities and do not reflect the Company\u2019s current operating performance. 3 Transformational Cost Management Program charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan. These charges are primarily recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. These costs do not reflect current operating performance and are impacted by the timing of restructuring activity. 4 Adjustments to equity earnings in Cencora consist of the Company\u2019s proportionate share of non-GAAP adjustments reported by Cencora consistent with the Company\u2019s non-GAAP measures. 5 The Company\u2019s U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (\"LIFO\") method. This adjustment represents the impact on cost of sales as if the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using first-in first-out (\"FIFO\") method. The LIFO provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Therefore, the Company cannot control the amounts recognized or timing of these items. 6 Impairment of goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets recognized in the three months ended February 29, 2024 resulting from the interim goodwill impairment assessment for the VillageMD reporting unit. These charges do not relate to the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company\u2019s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses and Impairment of goodwill within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. 7 Certain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements relate to significant charges associated with certain legal proceedings, including legal defense costs. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company\u2019s operating performance. These charges are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. In fiscal 2023, the Company recorded charges related to the opioid litigation settlement frameworks and certain other legal matters. 8 Includes fair value gains or losses on the VPF derivatives and certain derivative instruments used as economic hedges of the Company\u2019s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These charges are recorded within Other income (expense), net. The Company does not believe this volatility related to the mark-to-market adjustments on the underlying derivative instruments reflects the Company\u2019s operational performance. 9 Gains on the sale of equity method investments are recorded in Other income (expense), net within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because these do not relate to the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business. 10 Includes losses related to the sale of businesses. These charges are recorded in Other income (expense) net, within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. 11 Includes interest expense on external debt to fund incremental contributions to the Boots Plan required to complete the Trustee's acquisition of a bulk annuity policy (the \"Buy-In\") from Legal & General. The payments and related incremental interest expense are not indicative of normal operating performance. 12 Adjustments to income tax (benefit) provision include adjustments to the GAAP basis tax benefit commensurate with non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items including U.S. and UK tax law changes and equity method non-cash tax. These charges are recorded in Income tax (benefit) provision within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. 13 Adjustments to post-tax earnings from other equity method investments consist of the proportionate share of certain equity method investees\u2019 non-cash items or unusual or infrequent items consistent with the Company\u2019s non-GAAP adjustments. These charges are recorded in Post-tax earnings from other equity method investments within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees. 14 Due to the anti-dilutive effect resulting from periods where the Company reports a net loss, the impact of potentially dilutive securities on the per share amounts has been omitted from the calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted net loss per common share. 15 Includes impact of potentially dilutive securities in the calculation of weighted-average common shares, diluted for adjusted diluted net earnings per common share calculation purposes.\n\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS BY SEGMENT AND ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS\n\n(in millions) Three months ended February 29, 2024 U.S. Retail\r\nPharmacy1 International U.S.\r\nHealthcare Corporate and\r\nOther Walgreens\r\nBoots Alliance, Inc.

The Company does not measure Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. for its segments. 2 Impairment of goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets recognized in the three months ended February 29, 2024 resulting from the interim goodwill impairment assessment for the VillageMD reporting unit. These charges do not relate to the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company\u2019s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses and Impairment of goodwill within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. 3 Acquisition-related amortization includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inventory valuation adjustments and stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, developed technology and contract intangibles. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company\u2019s GAAP financial statements. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP measures. Amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired, or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. The stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustment reflects the difference between the fair value based remeasurement of awards under purchase accounting and the grant date fair valuation. Post-acquisition compensation expense recognized in excess of the original grant date fair value of acquiree awards are excluded from the related non-GAAP measures as these arise from acquisition-related accounting requirements or agreements, and are not reflective of normal operating activities. 4 Acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities recorded in Operating (loss) income within the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Earnings. Examples of such costs include deal costs, severance, stock-based compensation, employee transaction success bonuses, and other integration related exit and disposal charges. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. These costs are significantly impacted by the timing and complexity of the underlying merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities and do not reflect the Company\u2019s current operating performance. 5 Transformational Cost Management Program charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan. These charges are primarily recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. These costs do not reflect current operating performance and are impacted by the timing of restructuring activity. 6 Includes GAAP stock-based compensation expense excluding expenses related to acquisition-related amortization and acquisition-related costs.\n\nEQUITY EARNINGS IN CENCORA\n\n(in millions) Three months ended Six months ended February 29,\r\n2024 February 28,\r\n2023 February 29,\r\n2024 February 28,\r\n2023 Equity earnings in Cencora (GAAP) $ 79 $ 75 $ 120 $ 129 Acquisition-related intangibles amortization 33 27 67 65 Restructuring and other expenses 5 \u2014 11 \u2014 Turkey hyperinflation impact 3 1 7 5 Acquisition-related deal and integration expenses 2 5 7 23 Tax reform \u2014 1 3 4 Amortization of basis difference in OneOncology investment \u2014 \u2014 1 \u2014 Certain discrete tax expense \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (2 ) Gain/Loss from divestitures \u2014 \u2014 (7 ) \u2014 LIFO expense (6 ) 3 5 24 Gain from antitrust litigation settlements (6 ) (8 ) (14 ) (8 ) Litigation and opioid-related expenses (10 ) 2 (9 ) 5 Adjusted equity earnings in Cencora (Non-GAAP measure) $ 101 $ 107 $ 192 $ 246\n\nADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE\n\n(in millions) Three months ended February 29, 2024 Three months ended February 28, 2023 (Loss)\r\nEarnings\r\nbefore\r\nincome tax\r\nbenefit Income tax\r\nbenefit Effective tax\r\nrate Earnings\r\nbefore\r\nincome tax\r\nprovision Income tax\r\nprovision Effective tax\r\nrate Effective tax rate (GAAP) $ (13,114 ) $ (782 ) 6.0 % $ 607 $ 70 11.5 % Impact of non-GAAP adjustments 13,887 700 474 96 Equity method non-cash tax \u2014 (11 ) \u2014 (14 ) Adjusted tax rate true-up \u2014 (105 ) \u2014 26 Subtotal $ 773 $ (198 ) $ 1,081 $ 177 Exclude adjusted equity earnings in Cencora (101 ) \u2014 (107 ) \u2014 Adjusted effective tax rate excluding adjusted equity earnings in Cencora (Non-GAAP measure) $ 672 $ (198 ) (29.4 )% $ 975 $ 177 18.2 %\n\n(in millions) Six months ended February 29, 2024 Six months ended February 28, 2023 (Loss)\r\nEarnings\r\nbefore\r\nincome tax\r\nbenefit Income tax\r\nbenefit Effective tax\r\nrate (Loss)\r\nearnings\r\nbefore\r\nincome tax\r\n(benefit)\r\nprovision Income tax\r\n(benefit)\r\nprovision Effective tax\r\nrate Effective tax rate (GAAP) $ (13,472 ) $ (856 ) 6.4 % $ (4,662 ) $ (1,377 ) 29.5 % Impact of non-GAAP adjustments 14,843 932 6,671 1,369 Equity method non-cash tax \u2014 (15 ) \u2014 (23 ) Adjusted tax rate true-up \u2014 (134 ) \u2014 191 Subtotal $ 1,371 $ (73 ) $ 2,009 $ 160 Exclude adjusted equity earnings in Cencora (192 ) \u2014 (246 ) \u2014 Adjusted effective tax rate excluding adjusted equity earnings in Cencora (Non-GAAP measure) $ 1,179 $ (73 ) (6.2 )% $ 1,763 $ 160 9.1 %\n\nFREE CASH FLOW\n\n(in millions) Three months ended Six months ended February 29,\r\n2024 February 28,\r\n2023 February 29,\r\n2024 February 28,\r\n2023 Net cash (used for) provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ (637 ) $ 745 $ (918 ) $ 1,239 Less: Additions to property, plant and equipment (351 ) (497 ) (858 ) (1,108 ) Plus: Acquisition related payments 2 \u2014 429 \u2014 429 Plus: Bulk Purchase Annuity premium contributions3 379 \u2014 379 \u2014 Free cash flow (Non-GAAP measure) 1 $ (610 ) $ 677 $ (1,397 ) $ 560\n\n1 Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities in a period less additions to property, plant and equipment (capital expenditures), plus acquisition related payments made in that period. This measure does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures as the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments for future business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Cash Flows. 2 During the three months ended February 28, 2023, the Company paid $335 million to settle liability classified share-based payment awards related to acquiring the remaining 30% equity interest in Shields. The Company also paid one-time compensation costs related to VillageMD's acquisition of Summit. The payments are not indicative of normal operating performance. 3 During the three-month period ending on February 29, 2024, the Company made incremental pension contributions of $379M to the Boots Plan as part of the Trustee's acquisition of a bulk annuity policy (the \"Buy-In\") from Legal and General.

        "content": "Analysts on Wall Street project that Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) will announce quarterly earnings of $0.82 per share in its forthcoming report, representing a decline of 29.3% year over year. Revenues are projected to reach $36.48 billion, increasing 4.7% from the same quarter last year.\n\nOver the past 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been adjusted downward by 0.4% to its current level. This demonstrates the covering analysts' collective reassessment of their initial projections during this period.\n\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to gauge how the business may have fared during the quarter, examining analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics often helps gain a deeper insight.\n\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some Walgreens metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenues- U.S. Retail Pharmacy' will reach $28.55 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +3.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenues- International' at $5.83 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3.2%.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Revenues- U.S. Healthcare' will reach $2.06 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +25.8% year over year.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Walgreens here>>>\r\n\r\nWalgreens shares have witnessed a change of -5.3% in the past month, in contrast to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% move.

        "title": "Inflation data, short trading week: What to watch this week",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve told the stock market what it wanted to hear last week.\n\nNews Wednesday that the central bank still expects to cut interest rates three times this year sent stocks to record highs. Despite a pullback on Friday, the major averages finished the week with gains north of 2% across the board.\n\nIn the week ahead, a holiday-shortened trading week greets investors looking to cap a strong first quarter of the year with the Nasdaq (^IXIC) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) pacing towards double-digit-percentage gains.\n\nThe economic calendar will bring investors the week's key highlight on Friday morning with financial markets closed for Good Friday when the February Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index is released.\n\nThis report contains \"core\" PCE inflation, the Fed's preferred measure, which is expected to show monthly price increases moderated from the prior month.\n\nThe balance of the economic calendar will be highlighted by housing data and consumer confidence measures, while the earnings calendar will be generally quiet with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and McCormick (MKC) the biggest companies by market cap set to report results.\n\nThe Fed's future\n\nOver the first quarter of the year, the Fed and investors worked to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen 2024 began, investors expected the Fed to cut rates six times, or by a cumulative 1.5%. The Fed signaled in December that three cuts, or lowering rates by a total of 0.75%, would be more likely.\n\nThe two sides had found common ground ahead of Wednesday's announcement. And the Fed's confirmation that markets were \"right\" sent stocks to record highs.\n\nWith the Fed revising up its GDP forecasts, revising down its expectations for unemployment, and holding its interest rate forecasts steady, the central bank more or less issued an \"all clear\" on the economic story for 2024. The Fed raised its expectations for economic growth in 2024, but still expects it will be necessary to cut rates three times this year.\n\n\"Our main takeaway from the March FOMC meeting is that the Fed has fully embraced the positive supply-side narrative,\" wrote Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Significant upward revisions to growth did not lead to similar declines in unemployment or substantially firmer inflation. Despite projecting much stronger growth, the Fed sees the disinflation trend as remaining in place.\"\n\nAnd encouragingly for investors, Fed Chair Jerome Powell again reiterated that rates are likely at the peak for this current tightening cycle while outlining what Gapen called the Fed's \"asymmetric reaction function.\" Meaning, basically, the Fed is happy to cut rates when times are good (i.e., growth is strong and unemployment is low), and would be even happier to cut rates should growth stall or unemployment rise. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell attends a press conference in Washington, D.C., on March 20, 2024. (Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images)\n\nHousing, consumers, inflation\n\nThe week's biggest economic data point will come with markets closed on Friday.\n\nEconomists expect \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.3% over the prior month in February and 2.8% over the prior year. The Fed, you'll recall, targets 2% inflation.\n\nDuring his press conference on Wednesday, Powell noted Wednesday that the Fed's estimates have this number coming in below consensus. Following Powell's comment, Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro reminded folks on X that inputs from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports out earlier in the month \"get you nearly all the way there\" on estimating PCE inflation. Both indexes, we'd note, surprised to the upside this month.\n\n\"Our mapping of the CPI and PPI data point to a smaller 0.3% rise in the core PCE deflator last month,\" wrote Nancy Vanden Houten, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, in a note on Friday. \"That isn't low enough to give Fed officials more confidence that inflation is on track to hit the 2% target, but it does at least underline that the strength in January was mostly a one-off.\"\n\nElsewhere on the economic calendar, The Conference Board will release consumer confidence data for the month of March on Tuesday. This reading comes after the measure slid last month for the first time since November 2023. In January, the index reached a two-year high.\n\nThe IPO window cracks open\n\nAmid last week's hoopla around the Federal Reserve, investors also saw one of the most hyped IPOs in some time hit the market as Reddit (RDDT) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday.\n\nShares of the social media platform closed at $45.94 on Friday, giving the company a market cap of $7.3 billion. On Wednesday night, the IPO priced at $34 per share, netting $748 million in proceeds. Back in 2021, Reddit raised $410 million at a valuation north of $10 billion.\n\nThe natural follow-up question is whether Reddit's debut opens the so-called IPO window for a host of other companies looking to come public.\n\nYahoo Finance's Josh Schafer talked to famed finance professor Jay Ritter, who argued this would not lead to a boom in companies going public. Noting that Reddit and others \u2014 like Instacart's parent company Maplebear (CART) \u2014 had to take \"down rounds,\" or receive valuations lower than their prior fundraising level, during their IPOs, many companies will remain reluctant to test the public market.\n\nVeteran tech reporter Dan Primack at Axios argued Friday that this week's fundraises \u2014 which saw more than $5 billion raised globally \u2014 mean \"we're done with 'waiting until market conditions improve' or 'uncertainty.' If a company has the numbers or story to go public, the only impediment is inertia.\"\n\nAnd I think both arguments are right. Reddit mascot Snoo rings the New York Stock Exchange opening bell, prior to the company's IPO, Thursday, March. 21, 2024. (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nCompanies go public for many reasons. Some need to raise capital. Others need liquidity for early investors and employees. Others may be spun out from some kind of private ownership structure.\n\nFor venture-backed companies, the class from which Reddit emerged, avoiding a down round is certainly the goal. Moreover, many companies raised oodles of cash during the pandemic, making the need for more money a problem for tomorrow. And, whether venture-backed or not, no company wants their value to go down over time.\n\nBut investors and employees of Reddit were (and are!) sitting on windfalls that only the liquidity of the public market can make real. Even if the valuation falls short of yesterday's high-water mark.\n\nAnd on Primack's point that, essentially, excuses from management teams about why their IPO must be delayed won't hold water in today's market, Reddit's debut is proof positive.\n\nThe company's valuation is down about 25% from its fundraising two and a half years ago. But the issue was well-received \u2014 shares priced at the high end of the range that was marketed to investors.\n\nA criticism of the IPO process is that stocks are priced for the one-day pop Reddit stock experienced, not to find a valuation that garners the most capital for a company. In essence, these events are for bankers, not investors or employees. But of course they are.\n\nAnd over the long run, the value of Reddit or any other company will be set by the market and subject to forces that frustrate or confound executives, insiders, employees, and others. But that's the modern financial systemwe have. And after two choppy years, the opportunity for companies to join in on the fun is wide open.\n\nEconomic calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: New home sales, February (+2.1% expected, +1.5% previously); Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, March (13 expected, -11.3 previously)\n\nEarnings: No notable companies set to report results.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, February (+1.4% expected, -6.2% previously); FHFA house price index, January (+0.1% previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, January (+0.2% expected, +0.21% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, March (107 expected, 106.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, March (-5 previously)\n\nEarnings: McCormick (MKC), GameStop (GME), nCino (NCNO), Progress Software (PRGS)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA mortgage applications, week ended March 22 (-1.6% previously)\n\nEarnings: Carnival (CCL), Lands' End (LE), Cintas (CTAS), Paychex (PAYX), RH (RH), Braze (BRZE), Rumble (RUM)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Fourth quarter GDP growth, third estimate (+3.2% annualized pace expected; +3.2% annualized pace previously); Initial jobless claims, week ended March 23 (210,000 previously); Pending home sales, February (-4.9% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, March (79.4 previously); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity, March (-4 previously)\n\nEarnings: Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic data: Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, March (+0.4% expected, +0.3% previously); \"Core\" Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, March (+0.3% expected, +0.4% previously); Annual Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, March (+2.5% expected, +2.4% previously); Annual \"Core\" Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, March (+2.8% expected, +2.8% previously); Personal income, February (+0.4% expected, +1% previously); Personal spending, February (+0.5% expected, +0.2% previously); Good trade balance, February (-$89.7 billion expected, -$90.5 billion previously)\n\nEarnings: Markets closed for Good Friday.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "2 High-Yield Dividend Stocks Near 52-Week Lows. Time to Buy the Dips?",
        "content": "Investors looking for stocks that can deliver heaps of passive income might want to turn their heads toward the healthcare sector. Right now, there are a couple of beaten-down stocks offering above-average dividend yields.\n\nAfter falling a long way over the past 12 months, shares of Pfizer(NYSE: PFE) offer a 6.1% dividend yield at recent prices. Walgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA) still owns America's largest chain of retail pharmacies but its stock price has fallen hard in recent months. Shares of the pharmacy chain operator have been offering a 4.7% dividend yield. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThese stocks offer enticing yields now, but they won't help you retire comfortably if their underlying businesses can't produce growing profits.\n\nHere's a closer look at both healthcare giants to gauge their ability to maintain and raise their dividend payouts in the years ahead.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance operates America's largest chain of retail pharmacies. At last count, there were about 9,000 retail locations across America plus a few thousand abroad.\n\nBeing America's largest chain of retail pharmacies isn't as much of an advantage as it used to be. In January, the company ended a 47-year streak of annual dividend payout raises by slashing its quarterly payout by 48% to $0.25 per share.\n\nShares of Walgreens are down about 79% from the all-time high they reached in 2015. On the surface, Walgreens' 4.7% dividend yield seems attractive now that the average dividend-paying stock in the benchmark S&P 500 index offers a 1.38% yield.\n\nDuring Walgreens' fiscal 2024, which ends on Aug. 31, management expects adjusted earnings to land in a range between $3.20 and $3.50 per share. That's more than enough to meet a dividend commitment currently set at just $1.00 per share annually.\n\nWhile its reduced dividend is well-funded now, significant growth in the years ahead could be a challenge. Walgreens does not own a pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business, but its lead competitor in the retail pharmacy space, CVS Health, does. In a nutshell, PBMs decide which drugs our health plans cover and how much they cost.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor several years now, Walgreens has been building out a U.S. healthcare services segment, but it's still losing money. The segment posted a $1.7 billion operating loss during the 12 months that ended last August, then lost another $436 million during the three months that ended last November. I'd avoid Walgreens stock until the company shows investors it can execute an acquisition of a vertically integrated healthcare business.\n\nPfizer\n\nPfizer spun off its collection of post-market-exclusivity drugs in 2020, so these days, it's fully focused on selling and developing new medicines. The stock is down mainly because its COVID-19 product sales evaporated faster than expected.\n\nInvestors will be glad to learn that revenue excluding sales of its COVID-19 products grew 7% in 2023, and significant gains could be up ahead.\n\nSales of Pfizer's COVID-19 products fell faster than expected, but not before the company reinvested a great deal of the profits they generated. Last December, Pfizer acquired Seagen, a cancer drug developer that's expected to contribute $3.1 billion in revenue to Pfizer's top line this year.\n\nPfizer's dividend has risen 61.5% over the past decade, and investors can reasonably expect several more years of dividend growth. Management expects Seagen's revenue contribution to reach $10 billion by 2030.\n\nPfizer's confidence in Seagen's growth story is partly due to the Food and Drug Administration's approval of Padcev, a Seagen therapy, last December. Now, it's part of a chemo-free treatment option for newly diagnosed bladder cancer patients.\n\nPfizer offers a higher dividend yield than Walgreens right now, and I'd argue that it's a much better stock to buy and hold over the long run. Management feels the acquisition of Seagen doubled the company's oncology research and resources overnight. With this in mind, we can be fairly confident that Padcev won't be the only new blockbuster emerging from its pipeline in the years ahead.\n\nPfizer shares have been trading for just 12.4 times forward-looking earnings estimates, even though continued growth at a mid-single-digit percentage seems likely. Put it together, and the pharma stock looks like a screaming buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Pfizer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Dividend Aristocrat stocks can provide to be wise investments for those looking to shelter a sizable nest egg from inflation. These blue-chip companies have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years, making them some of the most reliable income generators on the market. Their share prices may fluctuate, especially during broader market downturns. However, their rising dividend payouts help hedge against rising prices over the long run.\n\nThat\u2019s why Dividend Aristocrats can be ideal holdings for retirees or those nearing retirement who prioritize passive income. Rather than chasing risky growth stocks, parking your money in these stalwarts can provide steady compounding and mitigate some volatility. Their dividends also typically outpace inflation, protecting your purchasing power. Of course, no investment is risk-free \u2013 even these Dividend Aristocrats could stumble in an unlikely crisis. However, each of these companies boast a strong track record, with the ability to historically bounce back from bear markets.\n\nSo, I\u2019d argue the greater danger is in not holding enough of these in your portfolio! Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) has continued its downward slide recently. However, in my view, this decline merely represents a good buying opportunity. This pharmaceutical and retail giant is the beneficiary of major long-term tailwinds, and is simply too big to fail. The stock has now declined 11% below even its Great Recession trough, which seems like an overreaction by Mr. Market. I believe WBA stock will likely rebound higher very soon.\n\nOf course, some may question my bullishness on WBA given its 66% five-year decline, which is not typical of a steady Dividend Aristocrat stock. And that\u2019s a fair critique \u2013 Walgreens is not your traditional Dividend Aristocrat. But with so little downside left, I see significant upside potential once the current headwinds clear. Combine that with its juicy 4.7% dividend yield, and WBA stock starts looking quite attractive here.\n\nStory continues\n\nYes, management has made some missteps in the past. However, Walgreens is turning the corner operationally, with sales continuing to grow steadily. Analysts also expect the company\u2019s earnings per share to stop declining in short order, with double digit earnings growth expected going forward, alongside mid-single-digit revenue expansion. I do not foresee WBA stock trading at just 6-times forward earnings and 0.13-times forward sales if this scenario plays out.\n\nThe elephant in the room is the company\u2019s hefty $35 billion debt load. But with rate cuts on the horizon, I anticipate that this debt burden will weigh much less heavily on Walgreens over the long-run.\n\nT. Rowe Price Group (TROW) T row price (TROW) logo magnified through a lens while displayed on a web browser\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nT. Rowe Price Group (NASDAQ:TROW) is a financial services holding company that has also struggled amid the broader banking slowdown. While banks initially benefited from higher interest rates, those Fed hikes caused a pullback in borrowing, creating a cash crunch for banks over time. As a major asset manager, T. Rowe Price has become collateral damage druing the broader financial sector downturn.\n\nHowever, with the stock market bouncing back and rate cuts likely ahead, I see TROW stock challenging its $215 peak again in the coming years as its business recovers. In my view, this stock is bottoming now, presenting an ideal long-term buying opportunity. The company\u2019s generous 4.2% dividend yield adds to the appeal. Notably, TROW stock boasts a strong history of steady growth and 38 consecutive annual dividend hikes. Once the financial sector regains its footing, this Dividend Aristocrat could deliver market-beating total returns.\n\nArcher-Daniels-Midland (ADM) Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) logo on sign at office campus\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nArcher-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) is a relative underdog despite being a Dividend King. The global leader in human and animal nutrition has declined 45% from its peak amid declining financials and an accounting probe. Notably, the company did miss Q4 earnings estimates across the board.\n\nHowever, I spot glimmers of hope, with the company still generating profits and ethanol margins remaining elevated. For a multi-year investment, I believe a buy-and-hold approach could prove very profitable as Archer-Daniels\u2019 core business fundamentals remain robust. Both sales and earnings appear poised to recover once current headwinds pass. The company paid out $165 million in interest expenses last quarter, but rate cuts should significantly ease that burden.\n\nThis is a nutrition giant has raised its dividends for 52 years consecutively, and provides a forward dividend yield of 3.26%. There\u2019s a lot for long-term investors to like about owning this stock at current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Dividend payments continue to be hugely important to investors, both as a source of income and as a means of growing their portfolios. And dividend payments are growing. In 2023, dividend payments around the world hit\u00a0a record $1.7 trillion, according to a report from British asset manager Janus Henderson Group (NYSE:JHG). Data shows that dividend payouts rose 5% year-over-year in 2023, with the fourth quarter seeing a 7.2% increase from the previous third quarter.\n\nWhile dividends have been moving upward overall, many companies issued large dividend cuts or held their payouts to shareholders steady last year. In all, 86% of publicly traded companies either\u00a0increased their dividends or maintained them at current levels in 2023. The other 14% lowered or eliminated their dividend, hurting their stock in the process. Investors may want to dump these three dividend stocks now.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nU.S. pharmacy chain\u00a0Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) began the year by cutting its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by nearly 50%. Walgreens said that it is lowering its dividend payout to 25 cents per share from 48 cents previously, a reduction of 48%. The company said the dividend cut was being made to help \u201cstrengthen its long-term balance sheet and cash position.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalgreens\u2019 dividend yield still looks strong at 4.81%. But don\u2019t be fooled. The company, and WBA stock, are in terrible shape. The dividend yield has been rising as the company\u2019s share price has been declining. Year-to-date, Walgreens\u2019 share price has fallen 22%. Through five years, the stock is down 67%. The situation is bad enough that WBA stock was\u00a0recently removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and replaced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nLegacy telecommunications company\u00a0AT&T (NYSE:T) also famously cut its dividend payout to stockholders by nearly 50% in 2022. At that time, AT&T CEO John Stankey said the dividend cut would free up cash that could be used to boost the company\u2019s financial results. Well, that certainly hasn\u2019t happened. AT&T most recently reported weak fourth-quarter 2023 financial results and issued soft forward guidance.\n\nT stock continues to perform poorly. Flat on the year, AT&T\u2019s share price is down 7% over the last 12 months and has declined 26% in the past five years. A current dividend yield of 6.44% might look enticing to investors, but it\u2019s a trap. The company continues to be dragged down by its wireline (landline phone) segment, which most recently posted a 10.3% sales decline in Q4 2023 from a year ago.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIn February 2023, chipmaker\u00a0Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) cut its quarterly dividend payment from 36.5 cents per share to 12.5 cents, a decrease of 66%. The dividend remains at the same level today, offering shareholders a tepid yield of just 1.17%. However, as disappointing as the dividend payment from Intel has become, it\u2019s a bright spot compared to the performance of the company\u2019s stock.\n\nThis year, INTC stock is down 11%. The company\u2019s shares are trading 20% lower today than where they were five years ago. The decline comes as Intel continues to report hit-and-miss financial results and runs into roadblocks with its efforts to pivot to becoming a microchip foundry rather than a chip designer. In February of this year, Intel announced a\u00a0delay in the construction of a new $20 billion manufacturing plant in Ohio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Preventing retail theft before it happens \u2014 it sounds like a fairy tale, but artificial intelligence could make it a reality.\n\nVideos and images of organized \"smash-and-grabs\"at stores and malls across the country have gone viral online, and some of the nation's biggest retailers are turning to technology to stem the billions in losses and keep employees and customers safe.\n\nAnd they\u2019re doing it together.\n\nCompanies from Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), and Home Depot (HD) to Walgreens (WBA) and T.J. Maxx (TJX) are collectively investing big bucks in AI, real-time heat maps, and other advancements in an unprecedented effort to fight against the issue of organized retail theft.\n\n\"We're seeing this groundswell of collaboration,\" Mike Lamb, a former Kroger (KR) loss prevention executive, told Yahoo Finance for NEXT. \"I'm seeing more of this collaboration than perhaps ever in my four decades plus of being in this space.\"\n\nShrink is the word\n\nBeyond the shocking images seen on news reports and social media, mentions of organized retail crime during retailer earnings calls increased by 43% between January and August of 2023, according to Yahoo Finance reporting.\n\nThe industry uses the term \"shrink\" to describe any hit to inventory, including from retail theft, employee theft, vendor fraud, damage, administrative errors, and other causes. And it's a big problem \u2014 in 2022, losses from overall shrink surpassed a staggering $112 billion, according to the National Retail Federation, a prominent lobbying group.\n\nHowever, flawed data make it hard to quantify how much organized retail theft contributes to shrinkage. Last year, the National Retail Federation retracted a false claim it made in a 2021 report that attributed nearly half of retail shrink to organized retail crime.\n\nAccounts of retail crime were also complicated when Walgreens CFO James Kehoe backtracked on his assessment of retail theft, saying the retailer \"cried too much\" about organized retail crime.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a 2023 congressional testimony, Trevor Wagener, a chief economist at the Computer & Communications Industry Association, gave a more muted assessment, noting that organized retail crime is responsible for around 5% of total retail inventory losses, though that still adds up to billions in losses.\n\nStill, shrink was the earnings call buzzword for retailers last year, and that has continued to some degree through the most recent earnings season, with Target CEO Brian Cornell noting on the company\u2019s most recent call that \u201cgrowth in shrink remains a significant financial headwind.\u201d\n\nPacking heat maps\n\nThat has led Target and other companies to do what once would've been unthinkable: partner with their direct competitors on high-tech solutions.\n\nFor example, an AI-driven heat map allows retailers to share real-time data with each other, in the hope of stopping large-scale smash-and-grab sprees before they happen and protecting consumers and employees in the process.\n\nThe heat map uses AI to predict future crime events by pulling in data from as many sources as possible, from law enforcement to the retailers themselves. That data creates hot spots for potential criminal activity that participating companies can see on the map\u2019s dashboard.\n\nThe longer-term goal is to equip participants with two-way radios and an app that dings if a crime happens nearby so that stores can be prepared.\n\nFinding the balance between preventing theft, curbing losses, and keeping employees and customers safe is precisely why retailers are working to find solutions. More than 50% of retailers said they\u2019re spending more on theft prevention, according to a recent NRF report.\n\nOver 90% of retailers plan to increase AI investments this year, according to software company Lucid.\n\n\u201cWe're figuring out, how do we collaborate better for everybody's safety?\u201d said Dr. Read Hayes, lead researcher with the University of Florida\u2019s loss prevention lab, which is spearheading the effort to develop new types of technology to thwart retail theft.\n\nThe lab, funded by the university and the Loss Prevention Research Council, houses more than 400 anti-theft technologies and evaluates how effective the tech could be in the real world. A who\u2019s who of the country\u2019s most recognizable retailers pays an annual membership fee of $6,500 to access the council\u2019s research. FaceID technology could someday be used to unlock cases in stores. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nTo improve the shopping experience, retailers are also exploring customer-centric solutions like using FaceID or biometric technology to open locked cases that would typically require an employee to open.\n\n\"We're looking at a whole lot of other AI plays here,\" said Hayes. \"Picking up on what people are saying, like threatening words or victims' words, things like that, that we think we can also map more in real time.\"\n\nShrinking privacy\n\nHowever, the preventive technologies strike a nerve with privacy advocates, who argue that obtaining that level of detail without the knowledge of those who are being surveilled is illegal.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the Federal Trade Commission banned Rite Aid from using AI facial recognition technology in its stores, saying Rite Aid\u2019s practices contributed to the risk of consumers experiencing discrimination.\n\nThe FTC and Rite Aid reached a settlement in the matter, with Rite Aid agreeing to \u201cenhance and formalize the practices and policies of our comprehensive information security program.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, employing technology like listening devices or facial recognition that have privacy restrictions attached to them makes the data harder to parse for retailers.\n\nMike Krol, a special agent in charge of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Operation Boiling Point, a unit created to address organized retail theft, told Yahoo Finance that fighting organized retail crime and respecting personal privacy continues to be a struggle, especially with challenges in how and where information can be collected.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement needs to be smart about where it's collecting information from,\u201d Krol said.\n\nTo help track the severity of retail theft, Krol\u2019s team has created an AI-powered analytics tool called RAVEN that uses machine learning to consolidate crime data across multiple jurisdictions. The tool helps to find links between individual crimes and disrupt the crime rings and affiliates that support them.\n\nKrol, who recently testified to Congress on the exponential rise in organized retail crime, said Operation Boiling Point saw a 200% increase in investigations in 2023, with his unit receiving leads from retailers \u201cevery day.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one wants to shop in a store that they feel unsafe in,\u201d Krol said. \u201cOur primary ambition is to provide that safe environment for both customers and associates, and technology \u2014 AI in particular \u2014 is going to help us along that journey.\u201d\n\nMadison Mills is a host and reporter at Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for all of the latest retail stock news and events to better inform your investing strategy",

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) closed at $20.82, marking a +0.97% move from the previous day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.65% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.49%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.96%.\n\nThe largest U.S. drugstore chain's stock has dropped by 7.49% in the past month, falling short of the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 4.2% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.27%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Walgreens Boots Alliance in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on March 28, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $0.84, indicating a 27.59% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $36.48 billion, showing a 4.65% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nWBA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.24 per share and revenue of $144.72 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -18.59% and +4.05%, respectively.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Walgreens Boots Alliance. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.02% higher. Right now, Walgreens Boots Alliance possesses a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nStory continues\n\nDigging into valuation, Walgreens Boots Alliance currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 6.36. This valuation marks no noticeable deviation compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 6.36.\n\nWe can additionally observe that WBA currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.27. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth.

        "title": "7 Command Economy Countries and 7 Others with Big Government Presence",
        "content": "This article covers 7 Command Economy Countries and 7 Others with Big Government Presence,offering detailed insights into the countries with centrally planned economies. You can skip our analysis on free economies vs planned economies and go directly to Top 5 Command-Economy Countries in the World.\n\nIn a command economy, centralized governmental authority dictates the means of production. In juxtaposition, a free-market economy operates on the principles of supply and demand, where market dynamics determine output levels and price mechanisms. Traditionally, command economies have found footing in socialist or communist regimes, while free-market economies resonate with capitalist systems and democratic societies.\n\nIn practicality, economies seldom adhere strictly to either extreme. Rather, they navigate a nuanced continuum, amalgamating facets of both command and free-market structures. For instance, across Europe, pivotal industries may be under state ownership and administration, while in China, a communist regime has sanctioned specialized free trade to flourish. This spectrum showcases the intricate interplay between governmental intervention and market autonomy within diverse economic landscapes.\n\nIn a planned economy, the state's monopoly over resources facilitates the optimal utilization of economies of scale. Nonetheless, this centralized control often fails to incentivize workers adequately, leading to a decline in individual effort. Conversely, in a market-driven economy, the competitive landscape among firms ensures that heightened worker effort is duly recognized and rewarded.\n\nHowever, this competitive environment may hinder the full exploitation of economies of scale. Instead, per capita output growth in a market-oriented economy thrives on the relentless integration of new technologies, which gradually substitute labor with capital. As a consequence, the growth trajectory of a market economy typically surpasses that of a planned economy, particularly when the incentive to exert effort assumes paramount importance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe discourse surrounding the merits and drawbacks of market economies versus planned economies is steeped in historical context. One school of thought posits that as industries expand and financial dominance consolidates, the relentless pursuit of maximum profit inevitably corrodes the fabric of free competition.\n\nIn this light, proponents argue that a planned economy, with its ability to emulate the intricacies of the price system, may be effective against the erosion of purchasing power. Conversely, critics contend that a planned economy risks stifling individual motivation and stands at odds with the fundamental tenets of the rule of law.\n\nChina is one of the best examples of a blend of free market and planned economy, often referred to as a mixed ownership economy. Since its restructuring in 1978, the country has endeavored to facilitate the amalgamation of state and private capital. Ultimately, state and private capital collaborate closely, fostering mutual support and cooperation.\n\nThe Market In China\n\nThe post-1978 economic reform was a spontaneous, evolutionary process wherein individuals seized emerging opportunities for trade and entrepreneurship, lifting themselves out of poverty. China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001 marked a significant turning point, invigorating the nonstate sector and catalyzing institutional reforms aimed at enhancing competition. These reforms not only fostered economic growth but also laid a solid foundation for further development.\n\nIn the two decades following this development, the trade relationship between the United States and China experienced a remarkable expansion. Presently, China stands as one of the largest export markets for U.S. goods and services, while the United States ranks among the top export markets for China.\n\nThis robust trade has brought benefits to the United States, including lower prices for consumers and increased profits for corporations. However, the United States remains discontent with certain aspects of its trade relations with China. In pursuit of its economic objectives, the Chinese government has infused subsidies into various industries with the aim of nurturing \"national champion\" companies.\n\nWhile some experts criticize these subsidies as wasteful, they also pose challenges for other countries whose companies struggle to compete against such substantial levels of state support. Moreover, the United States contends that many Chinese state-owned enterprises effectively serve as extensions of the government and do not operate under the same market forces as their private counterparts. In contrast, a large number of US industries and sectors are widely unregulated.\n\nLeast Regulated Companies in the US\n\nThe absence of stringent regulations in the U.S. is evident in the behaviors of various market participants. For instance, the relaxed rules within the real estate industry have facilitated money laundering activities by criminals and kleptocrats and sanctioned foreign nationals through real estate investments.\n\nAccording to a study released in August 2021 by Global Financial Integrity (GFI), a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, drawing on a database of over 100 international real estate money laundering cases, more than $2.3 billion in illicit funds were laundered through U.S. real estate between 2015 and 2020.\n\nAnother arena that lacks stringent regulations is the technology sector, which has been embroiled in numerous legal entanglements throughout its history. One notable example is the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) antitrust case, which emerged as a prominent legal matter a few decades ago, specifically in the 1990s. U.S. federal regulators initiated legal action against the company in response to its escalating market dominance in the personal computer market.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation to ascertain whether Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) was engaging in monopolistic practices aimed at controlling the personal computer market. Although the initial investigation concluded without charges, the U.S. Department of Justice revived the case in 1998.\n\nThe Justice Department filed antitrust charges against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), alleging that the company's bundling of additional programs into its operating system was anti-competitive. This practice effectively required consumers to purchase the Windows operating system to access certain applications.\n\nIn a move towards increased regulation, The White House collaborated with CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to promote the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act -- a Health and Human Services Department initiative.\n\nAmong its provisions, the act includes measures to cap insulin prices, expand access to adult vaccines, and empower Medicare, the US health program for the elderly, to negotiate prices of expensive drugs manufactured by major pharmaceutical companies. During their joint effort, the coalition emphasized the importance of educating consumers about the new Medicare prescription drug benefits and discussed strategies for pharmacies to assist individuals with filling out forms during Medicaid coverage renewal processes.\n\nThe leaders from CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) delved into programs like Extra Help, designed to support low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities in managing premium and medication costs. 7 Command Economy Countries and 7 Others with Big Government Presence\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the 7 Command Economy Countries and 7 Others with Big Government Presence, we used two metrics as major indicators: the 2024 Index of Economic Freedom from The Heritage Foundation, (which measures economic freedom on a scale of 1-100 of scores) and the GDP of the respective countries from World Bank Data. A lower Index of Economic Freedom score suggests that an economy has less economic freedom and a bigger government presence. We have combined these factors with the size of GDPs, and the degree of socialist policies implemented in the countries and based on that, we present the list of 14 most economically regulated countries in the world.\n\nHere is our list of 7 Command Economy Countries and 7 Others with Big Government Presence.\n\n7 Countries with Big Government Presence\n\n14. Burundi\n\nThe regulatory environment of Burundi is characterized by a mix of legislation and institutions aimed at governing various sectors of the economy and society. The country's legal framework encompasses laws and regulations pertaining to finance, trade, labor, environment, and governance.\n\n13. Congo\n\nCongo has undertaken initiatives with limited efficacy to promote responsible business conduct (RBC), urging companies to establish and uphold codes of ethics while emphasizing environmental responsibility. The Labor Code incorporates safeguards for employees, and legal mandates exist to compel businesses to safeguard the environment. Nevertheless, the country lacks a comprehensive legal structure to protect consumer rights, and domestic laws to shield individuals from detrimental business practices are absent.\n\n12. Ethiopia\n\nSince 2018, Ethiopia has experienced significant holistic policy and legislative transformations. As part of this process, numerous laws aimed at facilitating business operations have been introduced. Notably, the Ethiopian Government enacted the Capital Markets Proclamation, establishing a domestic capital market with the explicit goal of advancing the national economy through capital mobilization, fostering financial innovation, and distributing investment risks.\n\n11. Sudan\n\nBusinesses contemplating entry into the Sudanese market encounter significant uncertainty attributed to political upheaval, corruption, an ineffective bureaucracy with limited capabilities, a fluctuating regulatory landscape, and challenges within the financial sector. The existing government faces legitimacy issues, compounded by political instability that has led many local companies to postpone their investment initiatives.\n\nTo boost dwindling government revenues following the military takeover in 2021, the administration has raised the business tax to 30% in 2022 and escalated fees on the private sector.\n\n10. Bolivia\n\nThe 2009 constitution of Bolivia mandated the nationalization of enterprises in \"strategic\" sectors, encompassing industries such as fossil fuels, mining, telecommunications, and electricity. Under the leadership of President Luis Arce and the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) government, there has been a strong inclination toward nationalization and an economic model centered on import substitution.\n\n9. China\n\nIn recent years, China is experiencing decelerating growth and a progressively restrictive regulatory landscape. While the emergence of COVID-19 undoubtedly played a significant role in this slowdown, unexpected regulatory measures implemented by policymakers have further complicated the business environment, affecting market sentiment overall.\n\n8. Turkmenistan\n\nIn Turkmenistan, the absence of a well-defined rule of law, an unclear regulatory structure, and widespread corruption continue to pose significant challenges. Contracts frequently go to companies closely connected to the President's family. Moreover, the government maintains strict control over foreign exchange movements, imposing limitations on currency conversion that hinder the repatriation of profits or payments to foreign suppliers.\n\n7 Command Economies in the World\n\n7. Zimbabwe\n\nThe recurring practice of implementing ad hoc trade restrictions, including exchange controls and local content policies, to shield inefficient domestic producers creates a challenging environment for Zimbabwe's private sector.\n\nThe government's frequent policy shifts, often applied inconsistently and influenced by political or personal considerations, pose significant obstacles to business planning. Zimbabwe's regulatory landscape remains intricate, with businesses encountering difficulties registering and operating within the country.\n\n6. North Korea\n\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) continues to be regarded as one of the most oppressive nations globally. Under the authoritarian rule of Kim Jong Un, the government responded to international pressures and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 by further isolating itself and intensifying repression. Fearful obedience among the populace is enforced through threats of execution, imprisonment, enforced disappearances, and forced labor in detention and prison camps.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Top 5 Command-Economy Countries in the World.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n25 Countries with Most Gold Reserves in 2024 25 Companies with the Best Benefits and Perks 20 Countries That Read the Most in the World\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 most undervalued dow stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our introduction to Dow stocks and our coverage of some recent stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nThe close of February has seen some of the strongest fireworks on the stock market despite the fact that only two months have passed since we entered 2024. Whether it's rapid and sometimes volatile share price moves, such as the ones experienced by Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), surprise dividends like the one announced by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVDA), a fundamental shift in valuation best shown by the consistent triple digit profit growth experienced by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), or illustrious indexes such as the S&P 500 setting new records, the year has been filled with news and records.\n\nAnother change that took place in February was a reworking of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The Dow is one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, and its constitution is supposed to illustrate key pillars of the American economy to enable investors to take stock of a broad set of equities and find a suitable medium of trying to track the economy on the stock market. In February, the Dow and the Dow Transportation Index rethought its retail and transportation components, with the inclusion of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the Dow index and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in the latter at the expense of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU), respectively.\u00a0 reflecting the dominance of technology in the U.S. economy.\n\nIn fact, after the latest changes, out of the 30 stocks that are part of the Dow 30, eight can be described as pure play technology companies such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) or Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). If we loosen our definition to also count payments providers like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), then more than a third of Dow stocks will belong to the technology industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese stocks are called blue chip stocks, with the moniker being representative of high value poker chips. Continuing with our list of examples of major stock market events in February, one of these, i.e. a surprise dividend, also came from a Dow stock. This dividend paying blue chip stock is the customer relationship management products and software provider Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce's earnings report for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 saw the firm beat analysts' adjusted earnings per share estimates of $2.27 by posting $2.29 in the metric during its latest quarter.\n\nHowever, while the earnings report also accompanied a revenue beat, the guidance for the current quarter ended up slightly missing estimates. During Q1 2024, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) expects to rake in revenue ranging between $9.12 billion and $9.17 billion. Analysts on the flip side had an average estimate of $9.16 billion, and the revenue guidance for the full year also fell short.\n\nThis wasn't a surprise though. As part of its latest earnings release and report, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) announced that it will pay a 40 cent dividend, and at the firm's earnings conference call, CFO Amy Weaver shared:\n\nSince the inception of our repurchase program, we have now returned $11.7 billion to shareholders with an average purchase price of $182 per share. And I'm incredibly excited to announce our first ever dividend. We are enhancing our capital return strategy reflective of the confidence we have in the future of our business and our ability to drive long term cash flow. Our Board has approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend starting at $0.40, more details of this dividend are available in our press release. Additionally, the Board has approved a $10 billion increase to our share repurchase plan, bringing the total authorization to $30 billion. Based on our progress to date, the remaining balance in the program is approximately $18 billion.\n\nWith these details in mind, we decided to see which Dow stocks are finding favor among analysts. A handful of notable picks are UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). 13 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\nA close-up of a laptop monitor with stock market prices scrolling up and down.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most undervalued Dow stocks according to analysts, we ranked all components of the Dow 30 stock index by the average share price percentage upside.

The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, to which Walgreens belongs, has lost 2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nWalgreens is expected to post earnings of $0.84 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.24 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -18.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.50 indicates a change of +8% from what Walgreens is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Walgreens.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Walgreens, the consensus sales estimate of $36.48 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.7%. The $144.72 billion and $150.68 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.1% and +4.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nWalgreens reported revenues of $36.71 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10%. EPS of $0.66 for the same period compares with $1.16 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.1%. The EPS surprise was +4.76%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Walgreens surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nWalgreens is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walgreens. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Retailers are hoping AI-powered surveillance and other technologies can eventually make theft a thing of the past.\n\nVideo surveillance systems, locked cases that can be operated by smartphones, and AI-powered heat maps are just a few of the anti-theft advancements on the market.\n\n\"We're looking at a whole lot of other AI plays here,\u201d Read Hayes, head researcher of the Loss Prevention Research Council (LPRC) at the University of Florida, told Yahoo Finance on NEXT. (Check back for the full episode on Monday, Mar. 18).\n\n\u201cPicking up on what people are saying, like threatening words or victims' words, things like that, that we think we can also map more in real time.\u201d FaceID technology could someday be used to unlock cases in stores. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nHayes\u2019s group develops and tests a wide array of AI-powered theft prevention technologies. The LPRC is funded by the university and dozens of the world's largest retailers \u2014 from Target (TGT) to Walgreens (WBA) \u2014 which pay an annual membership fee to access the lab\u2019s findings and research.\n\nThe lab in turn works on theft-prevention solutions that those retailers can all access.\n\nYahoo Finance\u2019s Madison Mills took an exclusive look inside the research lab, where the council is developing a live heat map that pulls in real-time data from a variety of sources, including retailers, law enforcement, and fire rescue agencies. The map aims to track and prevent theft \u2014 or, at a minimum, alert other retailers on the app if a crime occurs nearby.\n\nThis is not just about giving retailers a heads-up. It\u2019s also about providing clarity on the scope of the theft problem, one that is increasingly difficult to quantify.\n\n\u201cIf we rely on public information, law enforcement information \u2026 that's very inaccurate. Not their fault. They only know what people tell them,\u201d said Hayes.\n\nMadison Mills is a host and reporter at Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for all of the latest retail stock news and events to better inform your investing strategy",

        "title": "3 Dow Stocks to Sell in March Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is meant to serve as a proxy for the U.S. economy. The index is comprised of 30 blue-chip stocks that represent different sectors and industries. Known as the \u201cDow 30,\u201d the index recently made a big change when it removed the stock of retail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and added the stock of e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The addition of Amazon has been largely viewed as a positive for the Dow. Walgreens had been a long-term underperformer that had dragged down the index.\n\nWhile many people were happy to see Walgreens removed, the truth is that there are many stocks in the Dow 30 that have proven to be long-term disappointments. This helps to explain why the Dow\u2019s performance has trailed that of the other major U.S. indices, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500.\n\nHere are three Dow stocks to sell in March before they crash and burn.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBoeing Co. (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nAnyone still holding onto shares of aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) may want to sell before things get worse. BA stock has been in free-fall following a January incident that saw a door-sized hole blow open on a Boeing made aircraft mid-flight. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been investigating the matter, and now word comes that the U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal probe.\n\nJustice Department officials have reportedly interviewed pilots and attendants that were onboard the flight when the hole opened in the fuselage midair, and investigators have told some passengers that they could be the victims of a crime. Where this goes from here is not clear, but it is more bad news that is dragging down BA stock. Year-to-date, the company\u2019s share price has declined 24%, bringing its five-year decline to 50%.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nStocks of most microchip and semiconductor companies are surging this year. Not Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The company\u2019s share price is down 7% since the start of 2024, bringing its five-year decline to 18%. INTC stock continues to slump as the company lowers its outlook for the year ahead and delays construction on a new $20 billion microchip and semiconductor manufacturing plant in Ohio.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel has said that the delay in constructing the Ohio chip plant is due to \u201cweak market conditions.\u201d This at a time when demand for microchips and semiconductors has never been higher, fueled by a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Intel had expected to have the Ohio plant operational in 2025. Construction has now been pushed back to late 2026.\n\nAt the same time, Intel has lowered its forward guidance for this year, saying it is struggling with a slowdown in demand for its microchips, particularly in the personal computer (PC) segment. All these issues make Intel a Dow stock to sell in March.\n\nNike (NKE)\n\nSource: pixfly / Shutterstock.com\n\nSneaker and athletic wear giant Nike (NYSE:NKE) is another chronic under-performer when it comes to Dow stocks. Year-to-date, NKE stock is down 5%. Over the last 12 months, the company\u2019s share price has declined 13%. Through five years, the stock is up 16%, compared to an 81% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index. Reasons for the poor performance include a slowdown in China and bloated inventory levels, among others.\n\nMost recently, Nike announced plans to cut 2% of its global workforce, or more than 1,500 jobs, to lower expenses amid what it too has cited as weak demand. Nike claims that retailers are lowering their orders for its sneakers and athletic apparel through wholesale channels, and that it continues to be negatively impacted by an economic slowdown in China, its second largest sales market. Nike had 83,700 employees last summer.\n\nThe company next reports its quarterly earnings on March 21. Nike had better show some improvement in terms of its turnaround strategy or the stock could really crash and burn.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Stock Drops Despite Market Gains: Important Facts to Note",
        "content": "The latest trading session saw Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) ending at $21.28, denoting a -1.21% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.12%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.61%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.54%.\n\nThe largest U.S. drugstore chain's stock has dropped by 4.82% in the past month, falling short of the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 1.42% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.06%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Walgreens Boots Alliance in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on March 28, 2024. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $0.84, showcasing a 27.59% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $36.48 billion, showing a 4.65% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $3.24 per share and a revenue of $144.72 billion, representing changes of -18.59% and +4.05%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Walgreens Boots Alliance should also be noted by investors. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.27% lower. Walgreens Boots Alliance is holding a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also note Walgreens Boots Alliance's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 6.64. This indicates no noticeable deviation in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 6.64.\n\nWe can additionally observe that WBA currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.33. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.17.\n\nThe Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 249, finds itself in the bottom 2% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Walgreens has settled charges by New York Attorney General Letitia James that it grossly inflated prices on at least 20 infant formula products after a recall by Abbott Labs led to a nationwide shortage in early 2022.\n\nThe largest U.S. pharmacy chain did not admit or deny wrongdoing in entering an assurance of discontinuance with James' office, including a $50,000 payment covering civil penalties and costs, that was made public on Monday.\n\nJames said Walgreens raised prices on the 20 products, including Abbott's Similac and Reckitt Benckiser's Enfamil, by 10% or more following the February 2022 recall, and in at least one case boosted formula prices by more than 70%.\n\nWalgreens allegedly sold more than 3,400 cans or bottles or formula at the \"unconscionably\" inflated prices.\n\nWithout admitting or denying wrongdoing, Walgreens agreed not to charge excessive prices on consumer goods and services vital and necessary to people's health and safety.\n\nThe Deerfield, Illinois-based company also agreed to donate 9,564 canisters of formula to benefit low-income New Yorkers with infant children.\n\nWalgreens declined to comment.\n\n\"During the formula shortage, families were panicked and struggling about how to feed their babies,\" James said in a statement. \"For Walgreens to take advantage of this crisis and jack up formula prices is not only illegal, but downright shameful.\n\n\"My office will not tolerate any company that attempts to price gouge our state's consumers,\" she added.\n\nThe settlement was effective as of March 7, and signed by a Walgreens representative on Monday.\n\nAbbott recalled its infant formula and closed its Sturgis, Michigan plant following reports that infants became sick after being fed formula that was produced there. The company reopened the plant that July.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Chris Reese and Stephen Coates)",

        "title": "1 Bruised Dividend Stock to Buy While It's Cheap, and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "Sometimes quality companies that have fallen on hard times can make for great investments. The market usually sells off their stocks to levels more than warranted when the underlying business hits a lean patch, or fails to meet the market's baked-in expectations, over the short term. But if the long-term prospects are fundamentally intact, such market actions merely make the stocks cheap, making them ripe pickings for value investors.\n\nHowever, it's also true that many investors have lost their shirts by betting on fallen winners from yesteryear in hopes of a recovery that never arrived.\n\nUndoubtedly, it's hard to distinguish which stocks are in which of the two categories above. So, let's examine one example of each.\n\nOne to buy: Pfizer\n\nDespite its high-profile work in developing a coronavirus vaccine at the start of the pandemic, the total return of Pfizer's (NYSE: PFE) shares over the last three years is down by 11%, badly underperforming the market. And it isn't as though the company can tell shareholders that it'll surpass its top line of $100 billion in 2022 anytime in the next few years.\u200b\u200b The windfall profits have all been realized already, and demand for its anti-coronaviral products will decline until it reaches its long-term level.\n\nBut that doesn't mean its dividend will stop rising over time, albeit at a slow pace.\n\nNor does it mean that the company's ability to pay its dividend will be threatened, and management actually plans to increase its capital allocated to shareholders as soon as it's done paying down the debt from its recent acquisition of Seagen, a cancer therapeutics business. With $64 billion in debt and repayment at the pace of the fourth quarter, when it repaid $1.3 billion of its long-term borrowing, that project will take some time.\n\nBut with the benefit of Seagen and a few other acquisitions, the future looks bright. In total, by 2030 Pfizer is aiming to gain $45 billion in new revenue. Few other businesses can say that their next six years will see as much additional sales in absolute terms, and with a world-class management team, Pfizer is more likely to succeed with its goal than stumble.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn that context, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12 looks inexpensive, presuming you're willing to be patient.\n\nOne to avoid: Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) is struggling to find its home in the U.S. healthcare market. Its traditional fare, consumer-facing pharmacies, is no longer sufficient to drive growth. At the same time, its dividend was cut this year from $0.48 per quarter to $0.25, and it is unclear when its payment will return to growth.\n\nThe smart move is to expect that it will take years. Despite its recent strategic entry into the primary care segment, its top line is not expanding rapidly, and its expenditures are up, causing its free cash flow (FCF) to fall significantly over time. The below chart shows Walgreen's falling FCF trajectory over the last five years despite near constant revenue. WBA Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nAs you can see, costs have risen faster than revenue, which has reduced profitability. That isn't the situation one would expect of a well-functioning business that has historically been competing primarily in a relatively stable industry like retail pharmacies.\n\nWhat's more, Walgreens Boots Alliance has no trump card to play in its hand at this point; it faces a grueling combination of slashing costs necessary to generate revenue by closing stores and the need for major new outlays to capture market share. Shareholders already paid the bill for the dilemma once when the dividend was cut, and they might need to pay for it again, too.\n\nThe company has been selling off hundreds of millions of dollars of its investments to cover its near-term costs. That will likely continue for the foreseeable future, but eventually it will run out of investments to sell. Plus, each sale decreases its assets, which is not favorable.\n\nWorse yet, Walgreens' leaders see 2024 featuring more headwinds than tailwinds, so don't feel like you need to buy this stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Pfizer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 25 largest retailers in the U.S. and the world in 2024. This article will focus on recent industry trends and the major players in the retail industry. If you want to skip our analysis, you can proceed to the section highlighting the 5 Largest Retailers in the U.S. and the World in 2024.\n\nAn Analysis of the Retail Industry\n\nAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the global retail market was valued at $28.84 trillion in 2023, The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8.1% and is forecasted to reach $42.75 trillion by the end of 2028. The demand for supermarkets, hypermarkets, discount stores, and out-of-town retail parks is also on the rise. In 2023, the Asia-Pacific was the largest and fastest-growing region in the retail market due to its continued population and economic growth. Meanwhile, North America was the second-largest region in the retail market. Its saturated market stabilizes the global retail industry. The leading demand segments within the retail industry include pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, electronics and household appliances, furniture, and toys.\n\nAccording to an article by Deloitte, there are several key trends shaping the retail industry in 2024. These include the shift towards demand-driven retail, which focuses on catering to diverse consumer groups, and a trend towards hybrid retail which blends digital and physical channels to enhance consumer experiences. Additionally, companies are optimizing operations through supply chain automation and are utilizing robotics and artificial intelligence to automate their operations. Moreover, companies are also leveraging blockchain technology to improve the transparency of their supply chain operations.\n\nHowever, the global retail industry is currently facing challenges due to ongoing geopolitical conflicts. The Red Sea, which serves as the gateway to the southern entry of the Suez Canal, is one of the world's vital and heavily trafficked maritime routes. According to statistics by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of New Zealand, around 12% of international trade passes through the Suez Canal, accounting for 30% of global container traffic and exceeding $1 trillion in goods annually. The canal reduces the maritime distance between Asia and Europe almost by half. The recent Middle East conflict has disrupted access to vital waterways due to Houthi rebel attacks on ships in the Red Sea. According to a report by Kiel Trade, the Red Sea's container shipment volume dropped to about 200,000 containers per day in December 2023, down from 500,0000 containers per day in November 2023, marking a 66% decline from the expected volume based on 2017 to 2019 data.\n\nStory continues\n\nKey Players in the Retail Industry\n\nSome of the largest players in the retail industry include Walmart Inc.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 15 worst performing stocks in S&P 500. To skip our analysis of the recent trends and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Worst Performing Stocks in S&P 500.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index was up nearly 6.9% year-to-date, as of February 26, and continues its rally that started in late October. The rally was supported by investor optimism about potential interest rate cuts in 2024 as the Federal Reserve\u2019s battle to control inflation seems to be bearing fruit. Recently, Goldman Sachs lifted its S&P 500 index year-end target to 5200 which represents further 4% growth for the Index based on current levels. Goldman Sachs has raised its forecast from 4700 which was announced in its 2024 Outlook report in December.\n\nGoldman Sachs is forecasting an 8% profit increase for the companies in the S&P 500 index, led by strong mega-cap profit margins and improved macroeconomic outlook in the country. David Kostin, lead strategist at Goldman Sachs, expects the earnings strength of mega-cap stocks, especially those in the Magnificent 7, boosting aggregate S&P 500 profits in 2024. Kostin believes that strong global GDP and a \u201cslightly weaker\u201d dollar will lead to positive EPS.\n\nWall Street added several consecutive weeks of market recovery since the last few days of October. The \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d, which includes Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, have played a significant role in this bull run. These stocks benefitted heavily from the significant breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence. For instance, GPU-maker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up more than 430% since the beginning of 2023 and nearly 63% year-to-date, fueled by exponential growth in its revenue.\n\nOur list of 15 worst performing stocks in S&P 500 includes companies from sectors that have been severely impacted by the recent adversity in the stock markets. The list includes companies from nine different sectors with a notable absence \u2013 the technology sector. In addition to suffering from macroeconomic and industry-wide market adversity, the stocks on our list of 15 worst performing stocks in S&P 500 have suffered from individual negative catalysts as well. For instance, Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), the second worst performing stock in S&P 500 year-to-date, is reeling from an accounting scandal as it put its CFO on an administrative leave in late January which saw its stock plummet 24% in a single day.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo recap, the Federal Reserve rapidly increased the interest rates beginning from near zero before March 2022 to the current 5.25%-5.50% range, the highest benchmark rate in the country in 22 years. This led to the failure of several banks in the United States, including the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank with $209 billion assets, and Signature Bank with $110 billion assets, in March, and First Republic Bank with $229 billion assets in May 2023. https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/5-best-performing-stocks-in-the-last-12-months-1184205/\n\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\n\nMethodology\n\nTo create our list of 15 worst performing stocks in S&P 500, we first ranked the S&P 500 stocks based on their year-to-date performance.

We have also provided hedge fund sentiment data for these stocks for reference.\n\nData from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2023 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.

Misunderstood by much of Wall Street \u2013 and consequently a favorite of short sellers \u2013 Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. [. . .] While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue.

        "title": "Here's Why You Should Retain Walgreens Boots (WBA) For Now",
        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. WBA is well poised to grow in the coming quarters, backed by its continued partnership growth and a strong focus on strategic execution. The company\u2019s long-term growth model looks encouraging. However, weak margins and stiff rivalry do not bode well.\n\nIn the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 1.6% compared with a 12.3% rise of the industry and a 12.4% rise of the S&P 500.\n\nThe renowned pharmacy-led health and beauty retail company has a market capitalization of $18.02 billion. The company\u2019s earnings surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in two, delivering a surprise of 0.77%, on average.\n\nLet\u2019s delve deeper.\n\nFactors At Play\n\nNew Alliances Look Strategic: A significant element of a company\u2019s growth strategy is partially dependent upon its ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances.\r\n\r\nIn the fiscal 2023, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield was signed on as the fourth payor partner for Walgreens Health. Walgreens Boots also partnered with TelePharm to expand tele-pharmacy services, improve access to care and provide flexibility for how and when patients engage with the pharmacists. In 2023, Walgreens signed a partnership with the Dublin-based biotech company Prothena Corporation. The collaboration aims to accelerate patient identification and recruitment for Prothena\u2019s ongoing ASCENT-2 multiple ascending dose clinical trial.\n\nLong-Term Growth Model Looks Encouraging: Walgreens\u2019 financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement, including those reflected in the Transformational Cost Management Program and other business optimization initiatives. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWalgreens Boots raised and accelerated the synergy capture goal from $150 million in 2027 to $200 million in the calendar year 2026. Moreover, the company raised its transformational cost management program savings goal to $4.1 billion. The company is well-positioned to achieve $1 billion in savings in fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nProduct Launches: Walgreens is launching a slew of products, which is driving the company\u2019s growth.\r\n\r\nIn December 2023, Walgreens\u2019 wholly-owned subsidiary \u2014 AllianceRx Walgreens Pharmacy \u2014 announced that it would distribute Tarsus Pharmaceuticals-manufactured XDEMVY (lotilaner ophthalmic solution) 0.25%.\n\nThe same month, Walgreens announced the launch of Rx Savings Finder \u2014 a simple-to-use digital tool designed to help customers save money on prescription medications. The new tool consolidates free third-party discount cards, providing patients with a quick and easy way to find lower prices on their Walgreens medications.\n\nDownsides\n\nPressure on Margin Continues: In the last few years, the slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots\u2019 margins. In addition, increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering Walgreens\u2019 margin significantly recently. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the gross margin contracted 239 bps to 18.4%.\n\nCompetitive Landscape: Walgreens Boots faces headwinds in the form of increased competition and harsh industry conditions. Even though the company continues to grab market share from other traditional drug store retailers, major mass merchants such as Target and Wal-Mart are expanding their pharmacy businesses and enjoying a fair market share. Notably, the retail wing of CVS Caremark witnessed a record market share gain following the termination of the Walgreens-Express Scripts contract.\n\nEstimate Trend\n\nIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2024 earnings has been moved down from $3.40 to $3.25.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $144.72 billion, suggesting a 4.1% rise from the year-ago reported number.\n\nKey Picks\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are Stryker Corporation SYK, Cencora, Inc. COR and Cardinal Health CAH.\n\nStryker, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reported a fourth-quarter 2023 adjusted EPS of $3.46, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.8%. Revenues of $5.8 billion outpaced the consensus estimate by 3.8%.

The company\u2019s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 5.1%.\n\nCencora, carrying a Zacks Rank #2, reported a first-quarter fiscal 2024 adjusted EPS of $3.28, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14.7%.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the oldest U.S. market index, created on May 26, 1896. Throughout history, its components have been large, established American businesses with competitive advantages. That tradition continues today with top Dow stocks to buy featuring some of the best global companies.\n\nAs stock markets hit all-time highs, it\u2019s time to consider some top Dow stocks to buy. Because the market has rallied over 20% since November 2023, it might be due for a pullback. According to the Carson Group, since 1980, the market has experienced an average drawdown of 14.3% in any given year.\n\nWhile a 14% correction is manageable, the more volatile growth stocks could decline materially. In contrast, the top Dow stocks to buy are stable large-cap stocks. Typically, they have a lower beta, hence, lower drawdowns during corrections. Moreover, in recent years, investors have treated these companies as defensive due to their robust balance sheets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith the market due for a correction, playing some defense with the following top Dow stocks to buy is warranted. Besides their defensive qualities, they are also long-term compounders.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the latest inclusion in the Dow. The company joined the index on February 26, replacing pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NYSE:WBA). There are several reasons why it\u2019s one of the top Dow stocks to buy.\n\nFirst, in its North American retail segment, the company is finally earning a return on its investments. Due to a massive fulfillment network expansion during 2020 and 2021, returns diminished. Results are improving now that capital expenditures are declining and the firm has shifted to a regional fulfillment network. Segment operating margins rose from -0.9% in Q4 2022 to 4.2% in Q4 2023.\n\nSecondly, the company\u2019s most profitable segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is reaccelerating. In 2022 and 2023, revenue growth decelerated due to customer cost optimization and macro fears stalling new deals. These trends are reversing, with the segment growing 13% in Q4 2023 compared to 12% in Q3 2023. Furthermore, the emergence of generative AI has only increased the demand for Amazon\u2019s cloud computing infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nThirdly, Amazon is rapidly growing its advertising business into a massive behemoth. Today, Amazon is the third largest advertising business globally. In 2023, advertising services revenue was $46.7 billion and grew 26% year over year (YOY) in Q4 2023.\n\nAltogether, Amazon has an enviable position. It is the leader in online retail in North America, and AWS has the largest share of cloud computing globally. Additionally, the rapidly growing advertising business will boost overall profitability due to its higher margins. Considering these strengths, this technology and e-commerce giant is among the top Dow stocks to buy.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is a credit card provider that caters to higher-income consumers. It has always maintained a higher growth rate due to the propensity of this cohort to spend. Furthermore, due to the credit quality of this target market, delinquencies remain low even during poor economic environments.\n\nThe credit card company is a stable business that earns a high return on equity. That\u2019s why even Warren Buffet appreciates its durability and economic moat. The company is one of the longest-held and the largest holdings in Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) equity portfolio.\n\nIn the current economic environment, the credit card provider continues to thrive. The economy is growing and unemployment is low, supporting discretionary spending. Furthermore, consumers are still prioritizing services over goods. International travel has been robust, which has boosted spending on American Express credit cards.\n\nThe company just delivered an outstanding 2023 with total revenues net of interest expenses increasing 14%. Additionally, diluted EPS grew 14%. For 2024, management expects revenue growth between 9% and 11% and EPS in the range of $12.65 to $13.15.\n\nAs of this writing, AXP stock remains one of the top Dow stocks to buy. At 17 times forward EPS, it is a bargain. Furthermore, the stock has a seal of approval from Warren Buffet, the world\u2019s greatest investor.\n\nMerck (MRK) Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate building\n\nSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough this pharmaceutical giant is up over 16% year to date (YTD), it is still a buy. First, it is a bargain at a forward price-to-earnings of 15. Secondly, its oncology and vaccines portfolio is well-positioned for growth.\n\nThe main growth driver for Merck is its blockbuster drug Keytruda. It is already one of the best-selling drugs and continues to be approved for multiple indications. In 2023, Keytruda sales rose by 21%, hitting $25 billion.\n\nThe blockbuster continues to enjoy robust global demand from metastatic indications. Furthermore, rising global uptake for new indications is driving growth. The drug is seeing increased usage in indications such as renal cell carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer.\n\nKeytruda continues to receive approvals for new indications. In February 2024, Canada approved the drug for gastric cancer, and in Europe, it was authorized for resectable non-small cell lung cancer. Since its launch in 2014, it has received over 40 approvals to treat various cancers.\n\nThe rest of the portfolio also has several blockbusters. For instance, Gardasil was a top earner in 2023, achieving $8.9 billion in sales in 2023. And, the company is investing heavily in its pipeline. In 2023, it spent $30 billion in research and development to discover the next generation of drugs.\n\nMerck has an expansive portfolio of innovative medicines and vaccines experiencing growing demand worldwide. This, coupled with financial and operational strength, lands it among the top Dow stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 4, 2024 / Walgreens Boots Alliance:\n\nOur global Supplier Sustainability Program measures suppliers' sustainability performance per product category with the support of an online system used for data collection, analysis, reporting and scoring. The program utilizes The Sustainability Insight System (THESIS), developed by the nonprofit organization The Sustainability Consortium, a holistic sustainability assessment tool that gauges supplier practices, performance and management on energy, water, ethics and more. We have seen year-over-year improvements with our participating owned brand suppliers in the setting of manufacturing greenhouse gas goals and overall reduction of plastic usage. Read more about our goals in our 2023 Environmental, Social & Governance Report.\n\nTHESIS is key when it comes to making sure suppliers are progressing on their sustainability journey alongside WBA. It helps us understand where suppliers are in their sustainability journey and shares guidance with suppliers on how to advance their own practices for year-over-year improvement. This two-pronged utilization of THESIS helps competitively drive the industry forward, as suppliers can compare themselves to peers while holding themselves accountable. Improved supplier data collection from the program has furthered our ability to identify sustainability opportunities and risks at the product-category level. By identifying risk and opportunities within our suppliers' practices and supply chains, it enables us to better direct our efforts in supporting the development of our global brands and supplier sustainability strategy by providing a clearer view of how supplier engagement can be targeted.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, WBA continued to grow and expand supplier participation in the tool achieving a 68 percent increase in own brand suppliers completion of the assessment. This represented over $1.3B in cost of goods.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor more information on WBA's responsible sourcing initiatives please see the latest ESG Report.\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Walgreens Boots Alliance on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\n\nSpokesperson: Walgreens Boots Alliance\r\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/walgreens-boots-alliance\r\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com",

        "content": "The drugstore chains CVS Health and Walgreens plan to start dispensing an abortion pill in a few states within weeks.\n\nCVS Health will start filling prescriptions for mifepristone in Rhode Island and neighboring Massachusetts \u201cin the weeks ahead,\u201d spokeswoman Amy Thibault said Friday.\n\nWalgreens will begin dispensing the medication within a week, spokesman Fraser Engerman said. The chain will start with some locations in New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, California and Illinois.\n\nHe said the company was starting in \u201cin select locations to allow us to ensure quality, safety and privacy for our patients, providers and team members.\u201d\n\nThibault said CVS Health will add states \u201cwhere allowed by law, on a rolling basis.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times first reported the retailers' plans.\n\nCVS Health Corp., the nation\u2019s largest drugstore chain, runs nearly 9,400 locations. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. has about 8,700 U.S. stores.\n\nTheir announcements Friday marked \u201can important milestone\u201d in ensuring mifepristone access, President Joe Biden said in a statement. He noted that many women will soon be able to pick up their prescriptions at a local, certified pharmacy like they would any other medication.\n\n\u201cI encourage all pharmacies that want to pursue this option to seek certification,\u201d he said.\n\nThe moves by CVS and Walgreens come more than a year after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration finalized a rule change that broadened availability of abortion pills to many more pharmacies, including large chains and mail-order companies.\n\nThe FDA in 2000 approved mifepristone to terminate pregnancies of up to 10 weeks, when used with a second drug, misoprostol.\n\nMifepristone is taken first to dilate the cervix and block the hormone progesterone, which is needed to sustain a pregnancy. Misoprostol is taken 24 to 48 hours later, causing the uterus to contract and expel pregnancy tissue.\n\nFor more than 20 years, the FDA labeling had limited dispensing to a subset of specialty offices and clinics, due to safety concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is weighing a challenge from conservative groups who are seeking to reverse mifepristone\u2019s approval or roll back policies that have made it easier to obtain.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

        "title": "3 Top REITs to Strengthen Your Portfolio in Q1",
        "content": "Wise investors know the value of dependable real estate investment trusts (REITs).\n\nThey remain one of the best ways to strengthen a portfolio and generate consistent income. Also, many of the top REITs can be bought on the cheap, allowing investors to collect high yields while waiting for the stock to recover.\n\nPlus, if we see interest rate cuts this year, REITs will become even more attractive. After all, lower interest rates will help increase property value. So this decreases REIT borrowing costs, which then increases their appeal to income-seeking investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, while we wait for most of the top ones to recover lost ground, we can collect yield. So let\u2019s examine three of the best REITs to consider buying and holding for the long term.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWith a yield of 5.86%,\u00a0Realty Income (NYSE:O), or \u201cThe Monthly Dividend Company\u201d just dropped from nearly $59 to about $51 and is now oversold.\n\nAdditionally, the company just\u00a0declared its 644th monthly dividend of $0.2565, or $3.078 annualized. That\u2019s payable March 15 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 29. Additionally, the REIT owns over 15,000 real estate properties under triple net leases with commercial clients. They include Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), and Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW).\n\nTriple net leases are far more stable than other REITs because of their higher margins. Remember, with a triple net lease, the tenants are the ones responsible for property taxes, property maintenance, and insurance.\n\nFederal Realty (FRT) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nRaising its yield for the last 57 years, Dividend King\u00a0Federal Realty (NYSE:FRT) is another one of the top REITs to consider. With a yield of 4.48%, it recently slipped from about $106 to a low of $97.40. Also, it just declared a quarterly dividend of $1.09 a share, payable on April 15 to shareholders of record as of March 13.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cFederal\u2019s FFO per diluted share reached an all-time high, showcasing the company\u2019s resilience in the face of elevated interest rates,\u201d according to CEO Donald Wood. \u201cOur multi-faceted business plan drove FFO growth, marked by continued growth in our comparable pool, contributions from our redevelopment and expansion program, and accretive acquisition activity.\u201d\n\nImpressively, FRT boasts some of the most reliable clients, including TJX (NYSE:TJX), CVS (NYSE:CVS), Gap (NYSE:GPS), Albertsons (NYSE:ACI), and The Home Depot (NYSE:HD) to name a few. Including those, Federal Realty owns 102 properties, including high-quality retail properties such as shopping centers and mixed-use real estate.\n\nAgree Realty (ADC) Agree Realty Corporation (ADC) logo visible on display screen.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAgree Realty (NYSE:ADC), which yields 5.26%, is another sturdy REIT.\n\nFirst, after dropping from about $63 to $56.40, ADC is a bargain at current prices. Second,\u00a0it also pays a monthly dividend. In fact, its last one was $0.247, which was payable Feb. 14 to shareholders of record as of Jan. 31.\u00a0Thirdly, the company owns 2,135 properties across 49 U.S. states, with retail properties net leased to industry leading tenants. Plus, President and CEO Joey Agree recently bought 3,500 shares of ADC at an average price of $56.92 for just under $200,000.\n\nFurthermore, earnings have been impressive. In its fourth quarter, its Q4 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) came in at $1, which met expectations. Revenue of $144.2 million was better than expectations for $141.2 million.\n\n\u201cWe remain intently focused on prudently allocating capital to drive sustainable AFFO per share growth above our previously discussed base case of over 3% growth in 2024,\u201d as noted by CEO Agree.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "The Dow's Amazon-Walmart-Walgreens shakeup is a reminder why it's no longer the benchmark",
        "content": "If you\u2019ve ever wanted an example of how creaky and cumbersome the ancient Dow Jones Industrial Average has become compared with modern market metrics, take a look at this week\u2019s Dow triple play involving Walmart, Walgreens, and Amazon.\n\nOn Monday, the Dow replaced Walgreens with Amazon in reaction to Walmart splitting its stock 3-for-1.\n\nThat split, for reasons we\u2019ll get to in a bit, reduced Walmart\u2019s weight in the average \u2014 yes, the Dow is an average, not an index \u2014 by two-thirds.\n\nAdding Amazon to the Dow, the folks at S&P Dow Jones Indices say, was done to keep retail companies\u2019 weight in the average from falling sharply because of Walmart\u2019s stock split.\n\nBecause the Dow has only 30 stocks, adding Amazon meant one of the other components had to go. So Walgreens Boots Alliance, which had the lowest weight in the Dow, got the boot and lost its alliance.\n\nWalgreens being booted from the Dow isn\u2019t exactly a surprise because its share price has fallen around 60% since being added to the average in June 2018 while the Dow has risen about 60%.\n\nHad Walgreens kept pace with the other 29 components, the Dow would be about 400 points higher than it is. With the Dow near 40,000, it\u2019s easy to see what little impact even an at-pace Walgreens would have made.\n\nAmazon, by contrast, has been a hot stock, one of the so-called Magnificent Seven that accounted for the bulk of the stock market\u2019s gains last year.\n\nWalgreens\u2019 Dow tenure lasted less than six years\u2014an extraordinarily short time for a market metric that doesn\u2019t change its component stocks very often.\n\nBut its exit, S&P Dow Jones Indices senior analyst Howard Silverblatt insisted to me, isn\u2019t because Walgreens has slumped and Amazon has soared.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a better fit,\u201d Silverblatt said. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying it\u2019s a better investment.\u201d\n\nOr as Silverblatt put it on Yahoo Finance Live, Amazon will help the Dow stay \u201crelevant.\u201d\n\nNow, a key question: will being added to the Dow be good for Amazon\u2019s stock price?\n\nStory continues\n\nMy answer, which may surprise you, is no. Based on conversations I\u2019ve had with market mavens over the years, I don\u2019t think that being added to the Dow will make the slightest difference for Amazon shareholders. Just as Walgreens being kicked out won\u2019t make any difference to Walgreens shareholders.\n\nHow can I say that when the Dow is such a popular market metric?\n\nIt\u2019s because although the Dow has great mindshare, it\u2019s got almost no financial market share compared with the hugely influential S&P 500 Index.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nThe Dow is calculated based on the share prices of its 30 components. That\u2019s why today\u2019s three-for-one split, which reduced Walmart\u2019s share price by two-thirds, reduced its weight in the Dow by two-thirds. New York Stock Exchange Chairman Richard Grasso (L) and New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) wear \"Dow 10,000\" hats. They answered questions after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 10006.78, above 10,000 for the first time, 29 March, 1999. AFP PHOTO/ Henny Ray ABRAMS (Photo by HENNY RAY ABRAMS / AFP) (Photo by HENNY RAY ABRAMS/AFP via Getty Images) (HENNY RAY ABRAMS via Getty Images)\n\nThe S&P, on the other hand, measures companies by their total stock market value, not their nominal share price. That\u2019s a much better way to reflect value than using share prices, which \u2014 as Walmart\u2019s split shows \u2014 can fall substantially overnight even though nothing about the company has changed.\n\nSo the Dow needs to go through contortions to offset the impact of Walmart\u2019s stock split while the S&P 500 does nothing. Walmart\u2019s market capitalization is still around $472 billion, and that\u2019s what counts.\n\nThe reason the Dow and the S&P are calculated so differently is age. The Dow was founded in 1896, when computers didn\u2019t exist and communication was glacial. Share prices were a quick and simple way to measure. The S&P 500, founded 61 years later, is a product of and for modern markets.\n\nThis difference in calculation methodology is why a whopping $5.75 trillion of investor money is indexed to the S&P, according to Howard Silverblatt, but only $87 billion\u2014a minuscule 1.5% as much\u2014is indexed to the Dow.\n\nBeing added to the S&P has a big impact on a company\u2019s share price because so much index money flows into it. And being dropped from the S&P hurts because all that index money flows out.\n\nHowever, so little money (relatively speaking) is indexed to the Dow that being added to it or dropped out of it has no impact, hence why being added to the Dow won\u2019t make any difference to Amazon\u2019s share price.\n\nOne more impact of the Walgreens-Walmart-Amazon triple play: Through Friday each dollar change in any Dow component moved the average by about 6.59 points, Monday\u2019s number is different.\n\nThat\u2019s because at Monday\u2019s opening the total share price of the 30 Dow components is different from the number at Friday\u2019s close.\n\nSo the Dowfolk had to tweak something called the Dow Divisor, which as of Friday was a wonderfully precise 0.15172752595384 and is equally precise today. Divide 1 by the divisor, and you see how much each dollar change in any Dow component moves the Dow.\n\nThe history of how the Dow Divisor came to be and how to tweak it to create your very own Dow is a lot of fun for those of us who like numbers.\n\nBut that\u2019s a subject for another day.\n\nAllan Sloan is an award-winning financial journalist and contributor to Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 60%",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Walgreens Boots Alliance implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price A total of 11 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Insiders have sold recently\n\nA look at the shareholders of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 60% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Walgreens Boots Alliance.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walgreens Boots Alliance?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Walgreens Boots Alliance, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Walgreens Boots Alliance is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Newcip S.A. is the largest shareholder with 17% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.6% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 11 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur information suggests that Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$86m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in Walgreens Boots Alliance. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nPrivate Company Ownership\n\nOur data indicates that Private Companies hold 17%, of the company's shares. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  Walgreens Boots Alliance is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is potentially serious...\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

        "title": "2 Ways the Dow Jones Industrial Average Will Change Forever on Monday",
        "content": "For nearly 128 years, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) has stood out as the most visible barometer of Wall Street's health. Since its official inception on May 26, 1896, it's grown from what had been a 12-stock index that predominantly featured industrial companies to one that now showcases 30 historically profitable, time-tested, multinational businesses.\n\nIt's also an index that's seen its fair share of modifications since the late 1800s. Excluding company name changes and mergers of then-existing Dow Jones components with other businesses (which may have also resulted in a name change), the Dow has undergone 51 changes since 1896. On Monday, Feb. 26, the ageless index will log its 52nd such change. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWelcome, Amazon! C'est la vie, Walgreens!\n\nOn Tuesday, Feb. 20, the\u00a0S&P Dow Jones Indices, which oversees additions and subtractions to the highly followed Dow Jones Industrial Average, announced that, as of the start of trading on Monday, Feb. 26, pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA) would be getting the literal boot. Meanwhile, e-commerce kingpin Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) will be taking its place.\n\nThe writing had been on the wall for some time that Walgreens, which was added to the Dow on June 26, 2018, would be getting the heave-ho. Unlike most major stock indexes that are weighted by market cap -- i.e., bigger businesses exert greater influence on the point value of an index -- the Dow is a share-price-weighted index. Put simply, companies with higher share prices matter more than those with lower share prices, regardless of market cap.\n\nAs of the closing bell on Feb. 20, 23 of the Dow's 30 components had triple-digit share prices. Walgreens Boots Alliance had the lowest share price by a considerable amount -- $22.31. Based on the Dow's divisor (the figure used to convert share price into Dow points), Walgreens accounted for just 147 points out of the index's 38,564 points.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile I believe Walgreens represents an intriguing and inexpensive turnaround candidate that has a multipoint strategic plan already in place, the Dow's success hinges on not only having business diversity in the index, but also having outperforming companies represent the index. Walgreens and its poor stock performance simply didn't cut it.\n\nAfter conducting a 20-for-1 stock split in June 2022, Amazon put itself on the map as a logical candidate to join the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average. While it'll help replace the retail aspect that Walgreens Boots Alliance brought to the table, Amazon will also provide clues on the health of the advertising market, as well as cloud spending.\n\nThe interesting thing about Amazon is that while it generates a lot of revenue from its leading e-commerce marketplace, the margins associated with online retail sales are very low. It's the company's ancillary operations -- which include advertising services, subscription services (e.g., Prime), and cloud infrastructure leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- that account for the lion's share of its operating cash flow and net income.\n\nIn particular, AWS is Amazon's workhorse. Even though AWS accounted for less than 16% of Amazon's net sales last year, it generated $24.6 billion in operating income, compared to just $12.2 billion for every other business segment combined!\n\nDespite having one of the largest market caps among publicly traded companies, Amazon will slot in as only the 17th most influential component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, based on its closing price of $167.08 on Feb. 20. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWalmart gets a stock-split makeover\n\nAmazon and Walgreens Boots Alliance switching places isn't the only change being made to the iconic Dow come Monday, Feb. 26. Following the closing bell on Jan. 30, retail behemoth Walmart(NYSE: WMT) announced that it would be enacting a 3-for-1 stock split, which would become effective at the start of trading on Feb. 26.\n\nA stock split allows a publicly traded company to change its share price and outstanding share count by the same factor and has no impact on the company's market cap or operating performance. It's a purely cosmetic change designed to either make shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors, as with a forward stock split, or increase a company's share price to ensure that continued minimum listing requirements for major stock exchanges are met, as with a reverse stock split.\n\nWalmart's press release that announced its 3-for-1 split made clear that its forward stock split was put in place to ensure that employees could more easily buy whole shares of the company's stock. \"Given our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come,\" said Doug McMillon, CEO and President of Walmart.\n\nAlthough this stock split won't have any impact on Walmart's operating performance, it, along with the addition of Amazon and removal of Walgreens Boots Alliance, will cause S&P Dow Jones Indices to adjust the Dow's divisor. In other words, what $1 in share price equals in Dow points on Friday, Feb. 23 won't be the same come Monday, Feb. 26.\n\nFurthermore, Walmart's stock split will cause the company to lose substantial influence within the Dow. Despite rallying to a new all-time high following the release of its fourth-quarter operating results this week, the company is on pace to be a $58 stock after its split is conducted. It'll move from the 17th most influential stock in the Dow to the 26th!\n\nA new era for the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average is right around the corner.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 22, 2024 / In fiscal 2023, Walgreens launched the Health Equity Champions Network. Health Equity Champions connect team members and customers to the work Walgreens does in health equity and serve as a point of contact for health equity work in their region. The work we have done to establish internal forums for improved awareness, transparency and knowledge sharing regarding health equity is demonstrative of our organizational focus on health equity and empowering each employee to be a health equity ambassador.\n\nHealth equity\r\nWe strive to provide essential care to the communities in which we are embedded. As one of the world's largest providers of pharmacy and other healthcare services in local communities around the world, WBA understands the needs of the communities we serve. Walgreens Boots Alliance is uniquely positioned to make an impact on healthcare access and affordability. You can learn more about our endeavors to improve access to healthcare for millions of people in our 2023 Environmental, Social & Governance Report. These efforts are reflected throughout our business activities, advocacy work and ESG initiatives.\n\nChampioning health equity\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic taught us valuable lessons about the important role our stores, services and pharmacy team play in the health of our communities. We see our pharmacists as our frontline educators. They are not only accessible in the communities where they work but are also often active and trusted members of those communities. Walgreens and other pharmacies were able to make a huge impact throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Between February 2020 and September 2022, it is estimated that services provided by pharmacies such as administering vaccines and antiviral medications helped to save over 1 million lives and avoid over 8 million hospitalizations in the U.S. Through new policy changes coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, Walgreens will continue its work to increase access to vaccines and healthcare services and reach underserved communities.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Company established three pillars by which we ensure our care remains accessible to communities:\n\nAccess: 78 percent of Americans live within 5 miles of a Walgreens or Duane Reade retail pharmacy. For those who do not, we continued the effort to go the extra mile to reach medically underserved communities with our mobile clinics. Our coach buses outfitted for health providers traveled coast to coast, meeting people where they were while distributing thousands of vaccines and other services. Partnerships: We understand that to reach those who need the most help, we cannot work alone. In fiscal 2023 the Company hosted over 1,000 clinics to address vaccine hesitancy and provide vaccines - working with community organizers and faith-based organizations to major companies. These events and partnerships have been instrumental in breaking down barriers and providing the tools needed to engage communities and overcome obstacles to care. Additionally, these partnerships will be leveraged across other health services. Education and information: We are committed to ensuring our communities have access to the information necessary to promote good health outcomes. Because our pharmacy team members live and participate in the communities they serve, they are seen as a credible source of information among their community members. Our pharmacy team members are actively combating misinformation and encouraging healthcare access.\n\nFor more information on WBA's health equity initiatives please see the latest ESG Report.\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Walgreens Boots Alliance on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\r\nSpokesperson: Walgreens Boots Alliance\r\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/walgreens-boots-alliance\r\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com",

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI^) just got less antiquated.\n\nOn Tuesday S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Amazon (AMZN) will replace Walgreens Boost Alliance (WBA) in the benchmark index. The change is set to go into effect before the market opens on Monday, Feb. 26.\n\n\"The index needs to stay relevant and reflect the higher end of US markets, and Amazon was a natural selection,\" Howard Silverblatt, S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst, told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nHe added: \"For the average investor it will mean that the index is more reflective of consumer selections at this point in time.\"\n\nThe swap of tech giant Amazon for Walgreens adds exposure to a variety of areas for the index. Amazon's wide range of industries including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, healthcare and e-commerce far exceeds the reach of the traditional pharmacy brand in Walgreens. This, Silverblatt, was crucial in influencing the switch.\n\n\"[Amazon is] developing and giving you exposure to a few other fields,\" Silverblatt said. \"But mostly you\u2019re dealing with the consumer, the retail sector, where the bulk of [Amazon] is right now. And that\u2019s a positive because the consumer is the biggest part of the economy.\"\n\nSilverblatt highlighted that unlike the S&P 500 which rebalances every quarter, the Dow Jones doesn't reshuffle the 30 companies within its index frequently. In the 120 year history of the Dow, there have only been 60 changes, per Silverblatt.\n\nOne reason a company can be swapped out of the index is if its share price deteriorates and becomes less relevant to the overall index. Walgreens has seen that over the last several years with shares down nearly 70% over the last five years, while Amazon is up more than 100% in that same time frame.\n\nWalgreen shares have notably slumped as more shoppers move to online options like Amazon. The struggles of pharmacies were most recently highlighted by Rite Aid's recent bankruptcy filing in October.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We don\u2019t not like to change the members in there because of consistency, but at times it has to be done because as the economy changes, the index has to change,\" Silverblatt said.

Amazon.com is being added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, joining Apple, Walt Disney, Walmart and other companies that make up the 30-stock average. (AP Photo/Michel Euler, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe shift was a welcome sign from Wall Street, which now sees the index ending the year at 42,000, up from 41,000 prior the announcement, according to Silverblatt.\n\nPart of this call likely stems from the increased exposure Amazon's addition provides to the stocks that have been driving the S&P 500 higher over the past year.\n\nAmazon is now the third of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks to be added to the Dow, joining the likes of Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Those seven stocks which also include Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), have helped propel the S&P 500 to a 24% gain in the past year. Meanwhile the Dow Jones has risen 16% in the same timeframe.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

At this point, the thinking... is obviously the economy and the markets have changed and we needed additional exposure and Amazon offers that exposure at this point in time. Also, Walgreens has somewhat declined in stock price so since its price-weighted, it doesn't have that much of an impact on there. If you wanted to stay in that field ,you'd have to find a higher priced stock in there. We also had Walmart's 3-for-1 stock split that reduced the weighting within the index. So again, the index needs to stay relevant and reflect the higher end of the US markets.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: The Dow Jones Indices stirring up the makeup of the Dow Jones Industrial average. Amazon set to join the index, taking the place of Walgreens Boot Alliance, that change takes effect prior to the open of trading on Monday, February 26. Now here to discuss the methodology behind it, what it means for that average investor. We want to bring in Howard silverblatt, he's S&P, Dow Jones Indices, a senior index analyst. Howard, it's great to see you here. So just talk about the significance of this change, and what it means to the average investor out there just in terms of their industry exposure, going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nHOWARD SILERBLATT: Well, there's only 30 issues, it's not the S&P 500. And we do not change the index, S&P does not change the index too often. There's been about 60 changes in 127 years, so a change is a major item a major consideration at this point. The thinking, basically, is obviously the economy, and the markets have changed, and we needed additional exposure. And Amazon offers that exposure at this point in time.\n\nAlso Walgreens has somewhat declined in stock price. So since it's price weighted doesn't have that much of an impact on that, if you wanted to stay in that field, you'd have to find a higher priced stock in there. We also had Walmart's 3-for-1 stock split that reduced the weighting within the index. So, again, the index needs to stay relevant and reflect the higher end of the US markets on here.\n\nAnd Amazon was a natural selection at this point. Consumers, enterprise, different areas, the exposure that it gives to the index. For the average investor it'll mean that the index itself is more reflective of consumer selections at this point in time. And that happens on a regular basis, to some degree. Amazon is no different than when we put Sears Roebuck in the 1920s. It's still a retail where consumers are going. By the way, Sears was taken out in 1999 for a company called Microsoft.\n\nAgain, the index needs to be relevant. We do not like to change the memberships in there. We prefer the consistency, but at times it has to be done, because as the economy changes, the index has to change.\n\nBRAD SMITH: When you have a company like Amazon that is a beneficiary of so many different segments within its business, whether that's Cloud, or whether that's its investments, or its play in AI, or the consumer and strength or resiliency of the consumer, that relevancy also can lead to being lighter fluid when they are especially beneficiary of so many different areas, and potentially propel the Dow to what, 40k very soon as well. And so what type of relevancy, as you make these changes, as we consider in the market's digest these changes, how does that propel us toward some of those other all-time highs as well for the Dow?\n\nHOWARD SILERBLATT: Well, in this case, the actual mechanics of the split, and adding Amazon, actually did increase the target price, that's the estimate for one year, not from S&P, but on the street. We do not choose stocks, based on whether we think they're going to be going up or down. Actually went up to over 42,000 for the one year from the 41,000.\n\nAs far as the Amazon makeup, yes, some of the other fields that it's getting its sales from, and some of its profits that are still growing, is somewhat of a plus, because it's developing and giving you a bit of exposure in a few other fields where we would have wanted to increase on it. But mostly, you're dealing with the consumer sector, the retail sector, where the bulk of it is in right now. And that's positive, because the consumer is the biggest part of the economy in there. And, again, at this point in time, we're better able to reflect it.\n\nAnd again, the 3-for-1 stock split was kind of the catalyst to the event at this point in time, it wasn't the major reason. You're always reviewing what's in and what's not in the index. And, again, you try not to do a lot of changes. So you really need a reason to be taken out to some degree, such as a merger, or a deterioration, or irrelevant in your price.",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance fell 3% in premarket trading on Wednesday after the U.S. pharmacy chain operator lost its spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average to Amazon, after nearly three years on the blue-chip stock index.\n\nThe replacement comes less than two months after Walgreens nearly halved its dividend payout to conserve cash as it seeks to win back market share from rivals and expand beyond its pharmacies.\n\nThe switch was prompted by Walmart's decision to split its shares, which would reduce the retailer's weightage on the index.\n\nWalgreens joined the Dow in 2018, replacing industrial conglomerate General Electric and becoming one of the five healthcare companies on the elite 30-consituent index. Since then, the stock has lost about 65% of its value.\n\nThe company has appointed new top executives, shut unprofitable stores and unveiled the dividend cut in January as it deals with low consumer spending, a drop in COVID-19 product sales and a slow ramp-up of its nascent healthcare unit.\n\nThe stock has posted a decline in seven of the past eight years and is down nearly 15% since the beginning of 2024. Shares of Walgreens trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 6.54, compared with 9 for larger rival CVS Health.\n\nS&P Dow Jones indices said late on Tuesday that adding Amazon would also increase consumer retail exposure, reflecting \"the evolving nature of the American economy\". The change is effective next week, it said.\n\nBesides dominating online retail, the Seattle-based company is a major player in cloud computing, entertainment and other industries.\n\nAmazon's shares rose 1.1% before the bell.\n\n(Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. will replace Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, according to a press release from S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCapital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Year's Biggest Deal  Largest Covid Vaccine Study Yet Finds Links to Health Conditions Your 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade Stocks Fall Before Nvidia\u2019s Must-Watch Earnings: Markets Wrap US Tells Allies Russia May Launch Anti-Satellite Nuclear Weapon Into Space This Year\n\nThe index change, which was announced after the market close on Tuesday, was prompted by Walmart Inc.\u2019s decision to split its stock 3-to-1, the index provider said in the release. The latter move will reduce Walmart\u2019s index weight due to the price weighted construction of the 30-stock Dow. Walmart will remain in the index. The change will go into effect prior to the open of trading on Monday, Feb. 26.\n\n\u201cIt certainly has been a long time coming for a major change in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. If any company represents the US economy better than Amazon, I don\u2019t think we found it yet,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \u201cIt replaces another consumer facing company, so the balance of the index remains the same.\u201d\n\nThe e-commerce giant\u2019s inclusion in the index is another milestone in the retailer\u2019s rapid expansion in the last decade. The company, founded in 1994 as an online bookseller, now famously sells all sorts of goods and runs the world\u2019s largest cloud-computing business. The Seattle-based company is the second-largest private sector employer in the US behind Walmart.\n\n\u201cReflecting the evolving nature of the American economy, this change will increase consumer retail exposure as well as other business areas in the DJIA,\u201d the index provider said in the press release.\n\nMeanwhile, Uber Technologies Inc. will replace JetBlue Airways Corp. in the Dow Jones Transportation Average, according to the release.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares of Amazon rose 1.5% in extended trading after the news, while Walgreens fell over 3%. Uber gained 1%, while JetBlue was down 0.4%.\n\nMore than a century after its founding, the Dow has ceded its preeminence as an investor benchmark, though it remains the most exclusive register of American corporate elites. As such, its additions and deletions are a litmus for industry trends.\n\nThe 20-stock, price-weighted Dow Transportation index includes the largest US companies within the industry group, according to the index provider. The move \u2014 prompted by JetBlue\u2019s low weighting \u2014 will help the gauge gain exposure to the ride-sharing industry, it said.\n\n(Updates share prices, adds context thoughout, including on Uber\u2019s addition)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures Pursuing \u2018American Dynamism,\u2019 Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC How Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars How Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable The Rise of Starlink as a Geopolitical Force\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon.com is being added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, joining Apple, Walt Disney, Walmart and other companies that make up the 30-stock average.\n\nThe e-commerce giant will replace drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance in the Dow before the open of trading on Monday, S&P Dow Jones Indices said Tuesday.\n\nThe shift was prompted by Walmart's decision to do a 3-to-1 stock split, which will reduce its stock's weighting in the index. The Dow is a price-weighted index, so stocks that fetch higher prices are given more weight.\n\nSeattle-based Amazon.com will join the Dow on the same day that Walmart executes its stock split.\n\n\u201cReflecting the evolving nature of the American economy, this change will increase consumer retail exposure as well as other business areas in the DJIA,\u201d S&P Dow Jones Indices said.\n\nAmazon's entry into the Dow, Walgreens' exit and Walmart's stock split will cause a ripple effect on the weighting of the Dow stocks. Once the shift is completed, Amazon's weight in the Dow will rank 17th out of the 30 stocks in the index. Walmart's weighting will drop to 26 from 17. UnitedHealth Group will remain the most heavily weighted stock in the index.\n\nAlso before the start of trading on Monday, ride-sharing service Uber Technologies will be added to the Dow Jones Transportation Average, S&P Dow Jones Indices said.\n\nThe change help give the index exposure to the ride-sharing industry.\n\nSan Francisco-based Uber will take the spot now held by JetBlue Airways, whose low share price caused its weight in the index to drop to less than one-half of one percentage point.\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices made the announcements after the closing bell. Amazon shares rose 1.4% in after-hours trading, while Uber's stock picked up 1.1%.",

        "content": "NEW YORK, Feb. 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- S&P Dow Jones Indices will make the following changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) effective prior to the open of trading on Monday, February 26:\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASD:AMZN) will replace Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASD:WBA) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Reflecting the evolving nature of the American economy, this change will increase consumer retail exposure as well as other business areas in the DJIA. The index change was prompted by DJIA constituent Walmart Inc.'s (NYSE:WMT) decision to split its stock 3:1, which will reduce Walmart's index weight due to the price weighted construction of the index. Walmart will remain in the DJIA.  Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) will replace JetBlue Airways Corp. (NASD:JBLU) in the Dow Jones Transportation Average. This change will help the index gain exposure to the ride sharing industry. The index change was prompted by JetBlue's low weight in the index of less than one-half of one percentage point caused by its low share price. The Dow Jones Transportation Average is a price weighted index, and thus very low-priced stocks have an immaterial impact on the index.\n\nThe divisors used to calculate the indices from the components' prices on their respective home exchanges will be changed prior to the opening on February 26, 2024. This procedure prevents any distortion in the indices' reflection of the portion of the U.S. stock market it is designed to measure. The new divisors can be found in the end-of-day index level files (*.SDL) via the S&P Dow Jones Indices FTP (EDX) site beginning on Friday, February 23, 2024.\n\nFollowing is a summary of the changes that will take place prior to the open of trading on the effective date:\n\nEffective Date  Index \r\nName  Action Company Name Ticker GICS (Global Industry \r\nClassification \r\nStandard) Industry February 26, 2024 DJIA Addition Amazon.com AMZN Broadline Retail DJIA Deletion Walgreens Boots \r\nAlliance WBA Consumer Staples \r\nDistribution & Retail DJTA Addition Uber Technologies UBER Ground Transportation DJTA Deletion JetBlue Airways JBLU Passenger Airlines\n\nFor more information about S&P Dow Jones Indices, please visit www.spdji.com\n\nStory continues\n\nABOUT S&P DOW JONES INDICES\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices is the largest global resource for essential index-based concepts, data and research, and home to iconic financial market indicators, such as the S&P 500\u00ae and the Dow Jones Industrial Average\u00ae.

        "content": "By Noel Randewich and Caroline Valetkevitch\n\n(Reuters) -Amazon is set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Walgreens Boots Alliance effective next week, S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Tuesday.\n\nShares of Amazon rose 1.3% in extended trade after the announcement, while Walgreens dipped 3%.\n\nAdding Amazon will increase consumer retail exposure as well as other areas in the Dow, and the move was prompted by Walmart's decision to split its stock, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a news release.\n\nThe Dow, which debuted in 1896, is widely followed by retail investors, making it an important reflection of the U.S. stock market. Institutional investors more frequently benchmark their performance against the S&P 500.\n\nAs well as dominating online retail, the Seattle company is a major player in cloud computing, entertainment and other industries.\n\n\"Amazon is almost a hybrid name. It's one of the names that falls into different categories. It in many ways exemplifies what the Dow stands for in terms of representing commerce across the United States,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nThe change takes effect at the open of trading on Monday.\n\nWalmart will remain part of the Dow, although its upcoming three-for-one stock split, effective after market close on Friday, will reduce that retailer's weight in the index.\n\nThe Dow is weighted based on the share prices of its components, not on each company's overall market value.\n\nAdditionally, Uber Technologies will join the Dow Jones Transportation Average, replacing JetBlue Airways Corp, giving that index exposure to the ride-hailing industry, S&P Dow Jones Indices said.\n\nAmazon's addition to the Dow is the first since 2020, when Salesforce, Amgen and Honeywell International replaced Exxon Mobil, Pfizer and Raytheon Technologies.\n\nWalgreens joined the Dow in 2018, replacing General Electric.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewih in Oakland, Calif, Caroline Valetkevitch in New York and Bhanvi Satija in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai and Christopher Cushing)",

        "title": "Q&amp;A With Walgreens Boot Alliance's Environmental Social Governance Committee Chair Ornella Barra",
        "content": "NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 20, 2024 / Walgreens Boots Alliance recently released their 2023 Environmental, Social & Governance Report. Ornella Barra, EVP, Chief Operating Officer, International and Chair of the ESG Committee, WBA, reflects on the organizations' success and what's next.\n\nThis is a significant year for WBA as Boots celebrates 175 years while Walgreens and Farmacias Benavides are 123 and 107 respectively. What is the secret to this longevity?\n\nTo understand this requires us to look back at where we started. Every day, I take inspiration from the incredible people who founded our company or who have shared their passion and vision over the years. From John Boot to Charles Walgreen, we have remained committed to providing trusted pharmacist support to bring affordable community healthcare to all.\n\nOur vision today remains to be the leading partner in reimagining local healthcare and well-being. Our health-centered ESG strategy plays an integral role in our ambition.\n\nAt the heart of that responsibility is delivering affordable, accessible and quality healthcare and we have always understood the power of partnerships to achieve this. We have many long-standing partnerships such as Vitamin Angels (globally and U.S.), Macmillan Cancer Support (UK), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - EORTC (Europe and beyond) and Fundaci\u00f3n Alma (Mexico). Over the past eight years, we have donated $373 million1 to support the health and well-being of the communities we serve.\n\nIt is the dedication of our team members that brings these partnerships to life. They are on the front lines, and we thank them for their efforts. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of team members, what do you value most about their contribution?\n\nOur people make us who we are: the service we give, the products we make, the positive impact we have; it is their desire to innovate and imagine the future that ensures we continue to move forward. Take, for example, our brands Liz Earle, Soap & Glory and 17 which have all achieved Cruelty Free International Leaping Bunny approval, and, this year, following huge strides in packaging in 2022, No7 launched its most inclusive skin care range yet: Future Renew.\n\nStory continues\n\nCreating a culture where innovation thrives has always been in our DNA; in 1934 Boots introduced the five-day working week and were early pioneers of extended education for young employees. Today, we believe that providing learning and development opportunities for our 331,000 team members is no less essential. Since launching in 2013, Walgreens University has provided training, leadership development and career advancement for team members at all levels.\n\nMy roots are in pharmacy, and with our experienced leaders, I am committed to fostering an environment for personal and professional growth for the long term.\r\n\r\nLast year you set ambitious health equity goals. How have you performed?\n\nWe introduced goals on key ESG topics including reduction of carbon emissions and waste as well as driving our inclusive culture with a focus on women in leadership, supplier diversity, people of color and people with disabilities. I am pleased to confirm that we exceeded most of our goals2, including a nearly 3 percentage point increase in U.S. team members identifying as having a disability and continued strong progress to reducing carbon emissions by 25 percent from our 2019 baseline. \r\n\r\nWhat does the future hold for ESG at WBA?\n\nOur health-centered ESG strategy remains as relevant today as it always has been. In 2023 we completed our first forward looking double materiality assessment which, once again, reinforced our focus supporting the health and well-being of people, patients and customers, communities and planet. It is my continued pleasure to Chair the WBA ESG Committee and I would like to thank the WBA Board, my fellow committee members, our teams and our incredible partners around the world for their unwavering commitment.\n\nFor more information on WBA's sustainability initiatives please see the latest ESG Report. \r\n\r\n1Cash and Non-cash valuation of community contributions.

        "title": "15 Biggest Cloud Providers by Market Share in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 biggest cloud providers by market share in 2024. We have also discussed the latest revenue and growth of top cloud providers. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Biggest Cloud Providers by Market Share in 2024.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has fueled a rapid shift towards cloud adoption, with projections indicating that global spending on cloud services and related components will exceed $1.0 trillion in 2024, maintaining a CAGR of 15.7%.\n\nMoreover, the global cloud services market is witnessing major growth, with a projected value of $2.19 trillion by 2032, with a CAGR of 17.10% from 2023. In 2022, North America held a dominant market share of 42%, driven by a strong emphasis on digitalization, particularly in sectors like IoT, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence. Large enterprises accounted for 52% of the market share in 2022, reflecting their investment in cloud solutions for enhanced agility and efficiency.\n\nThe market is segmented by deployment, with private clouds leading in 2022 with a share of over 47%, offering organizations greater control and security. However, hybrid clouds are expected to witness rapid growth, driven by SMEs adopting cloud-based solutions for productivity enhancement and cost reduction. Software as a Service (SaaS) dominated the market in 2022 due to its ease of deployment and cost-effectiveness, while Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is projected to grow rapidly, fueled by the demand for hybrid cloud platforms and robust data storage solutions.\n\nIn terms of region, Asia Pacific is anticipated to experience exponential growth, fueled by increasing demand from sectors such as manufacturing and healthcare. Additionally, key market developments, such as collaborations between companies like Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), underscore the growing importance of cloud technology in revolutionizing different industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, AI-as-a-Service is democratizing AI through cloud platforms, enabling businesses to harness transformative technologies without heavy investment. Leveraging vast compute power and data, AI models like ChatGPT are trained, offering economic and social benefits. Predicted to rise from 76% to 85%, multi-cloud strategies provide cost and flexibility advantages but pose challenges in data governance and integration.\n\nHybrid cloud solutions combining on-premises infrastructure with cloud services are also gaining popularity, allowing organizations to balance security and flexibility. In 2024, real-time cloud infrastructure is becoming equally vital, as organizations are prioritizing up-to-the-minute insights over stale data. Streamed data consumption is also on the rise, emphasizing the need for instant access storage like Flash and solid-state devices. This shift accommodates trends such as cloud gaming and streamed entertainment from platforms like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT), indicating a growing demand for real-time data handling capabilities.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (CGP) are the top three cloud providers in the world in 2024.\n\nOn the financial end, in the fourth quarter of 2024, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s cloud division, AWS, witnessed a revenue growth of 13% year over year, hitting $24.20 billion, meeting analysts' expectations precisely. This growth was attributed to the increasing adoption of cloud services for artificial intelligence, with AWS introducing products like the Q chatbot and the Trainium2 chip. Despite this growth, AWS faced stiff competition from Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s Azure and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google Cloud, which saw revenue increases of 30% and 26%, respectively. However, AWS maintained its position as a major contributor to Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s\u00a0 overall revenue, representing 14% of the company's total earnings.\n\nOperating income for AWS in the fourth quarter stood at $7.17 billion, surpassing StreetAccount's consensus by approximately 38%. This stable performance further solidified AWS's continued profitability and dominance in the cloud services market. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s decision to extend the useful life of its servers to six years is projected to bolster first-quarter operating income by $900 million.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s Azure cloud platform is rapidly gaining ground on Amazon Web Services (AWS), with analysts estimating Azure to now be about three-quarters the size of its top competitor, compared to being only half its size five years ago. Much of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s recent success can be to its strategic focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Revenue growth in Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s Azure and cloud services division is being largely boosted by AI, with 6 points of revenue growth attributed to AI in the latest period. This growth outpaces AWS, with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure\u2019s revenue increasing by 30% compared to AWS's 13% year-over-year growth.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s investment in AI isn't just limited to software; they're also integrating AI capabilities into their cloud infrastructure, including the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) for running AI models. Their collaboration with OpenAI, including technologies like GPT-4, has attracted a considerable number of Azure AI customers.\n\nTo read more about cloud companies, see Top 20 Cloud Computing Companies in USA. 15 Biggest Cloud Providers by Market Share in 2024\n\nA team of software developers gathered around a monitor discussing a new CRM platform.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the biggest cloud providers by market share in 2024, we utilized the market share value of big cloud companies based on their Q4 2023 revenue from their respective cloud segments. We obtained data of Q4 2023 market share data from CRN.com.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

        "content": "A retirement portfolio isn\u2019t the place to bet on startups and penny stocks. Investing for your Golden Years means seeking out quality stocks that offer a combination of growth, income and safety. Instead of betting the farm on making a killing overnight, you\u2019re better off taking the slow and steady approach.\n\nBut don\u2019t mistake consistency for boring. Retirement stocks that offer capital appreciation and rising revenue streams all the while protecting your bottom line over the long haul seem pretty exciting to me. That\u2019s why these three quality stocks should be in every investor\u2019s portfolio.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCommercial real estate investment trust Realty Income (NYSE:O) tops the list of retirement stock stars. Billed as the Monthly Dividend Company, the REIT recently made the 644th consecutive monthly dividend payment in its 55-year history. Since going public in 1994, Realty Income has increased its payout 123 times. There is arguably no more dependable dividend stock than this commercial REIT.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlthough the commercial market remains at risk due to high interest rates raising costs and dampening investments in the segment, it\u2019s not a problem for Realty Income. The REIT\u2019s tenants are top-tier businesses such as Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), and 7-Eleven (OTCMKTS:SVNDY). Standalone grocery and convenience stores make up over 20% of its tenant portfolio. These aren\u2019t businesses at risk of shutting down.\n\nThe annual dividend of $3.07 per share yields 5.9%. Wall Street has a one-year consensus price target of around $62 per share suggesting a 20% upside from its current price level. Analysts consider the stock a buy. With revenue and earnings forecast to grow more than 22% in the next year, O stock is one to begin building out your retirement portfolio.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) The website for Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nBeverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is the second quality retirement stock an investor should consider. A favorite of Warren Buffett, the soda king is also a model of consistency and stability.\n\nBecause of consumer loyalty through good times and bad, Coca-Cola is deemed \u201cthe world\u2019s most valuable non-alcoholic drink\u201d brand. It generated $45.7 billion in sales last year as it figured out how to pivot away solely from soda to healthier beverage options. Changing consumer tastes put soda consumption on a secular decline but Coke now has a portfolio of drinks spanning water, juice, tea, dairy and plant-based beverages. And yes, it still does soda for all of us recalcitrants who refuse to give up our guilty pleasures.\n\nKO stock also pays a dividend that was just hiked 5.4% to 48.5 cents for an annual rate of $1.94 per share. Coke solidified its position as a Dividend King as this is the 62nd consecutive annual increase of a payout that now yields 3.3%. It\u2019s a defensive stock that offers investors long-term growth, income and safety.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayments processor Visa (NYSE:V) rounds out our trio of top-notch retirement stocks for your portfolio. It is also the most exciting of the three because it provides investors with a history of robust share price appreciation and dividend growth.\n\nThe payout yields just 0.8% annually but the company routinely increases the dividend by double-digit rates. It has a 10-year compounded annual growth rate over 18%. Because companies pay their dividends out of free cash flow (FCF), Visa\u2019s cash flow payout ratio of less than 20% shows just how safe the dividend is. It\u2019s why there is plenty of room for future growth.\n\nThe company itself is also solid. Visa is the largest payments processor with 4.3 billion Visa cards in circulation. The company generated $14.5 trillion in total payments and cash volume for the full fiscal year. By sticking to just processing credit card transactions and not extending credit to consumers, the company carries little recession risk. Late payments or even defaults do not impact its operations.\n\nVisa is yet another retirement stock that possesses all three values investors should seek in a company for their portfolios.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in O and KO stock.

        "title": "Walgreens Boots Alliance Just Made $992 Million. Here's Why That's Not Good News.",
        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) just created a windfall of $992 million for itself, and there might be other similar paydays on the horizon. But don't place your buy order for the stock just yet. Sometimes, making easy cash can have consequences. And this is arguably one of those times. Here's why.\n\nWhy stacking cash is bearish\n\nThe way that businesses make money matters. There's not much point in buying shares of an operation that's selling off its productive assets to keep the lights on, because in the future, especially in the long term, it probably won't be able to generate as much revenue or earnings as it did in the past.\n\nWalgreens isn't quite at the point of scrapping its core capabilities for short-term relief from its financial problems, but it seems to be getting closer over time.\n\nWith the company selling off $992 million worth of its stake in Cencora on Feb. 7, following another sale of $674 million late last year, investors would do well to pay careful attention to what exactly is going on and why. This move, along with a third $1.6 billion sale of Cencora shares in August of 2023, belies deeper issues that signal caution rather than opportunity.\n\nManagement says that the proceeds from the sale of these investments will go toward paying down some of the company's staggering debt load of $34.7 billion. Liquidating marketable securities is a temporary way to offset the fact that its trailing-12-month operating income is deep in the red, with losses of more than $1 billion. Worse yet, in its fiscal first quarter, investors just saw their quarterly dividend fall by nearly half.\n\nIt's clear that money is tight for Walgreens right now, and relief might not be in sight despite ongoing efforts to realize cost savings and reduce capital expenditures. Its new healthcare segment, which aims to provide primary-care services from its pharmacies, is anticipated to deliver adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of up to $50 million this fiscal year -- or as low as losses of as much as $50 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe fact that management isn't able to give shareholders a real clue about whether the segment will be reporting positive adjusted EBITDA or not isn't a good sign -- such accounting-adjusted figures are almost always more favorable to companies than non-adjusted ones.\n\nWhat might improve and when?\n\nThe point of Walgreens spinning up a new healthcare segment, which competes with CVS Health, is to shore up its slow pace of top-line growth over the last five years.\n\nThe catch is that entering new lines of business typically causes profit margins to compress as companies spend on establishing market share, which is what Walgreens is in the process of doing right now. And with growth still slow, and financial flexibility increasingly constrained, the situation will likely take at least another year or so to sort itself out, assuming it does.\n\nSo the near-term setup is bearish, to say the least. Still, Walgreens has plenty of assets to sell off, including long-term equity investments like the stocks it sold recently. The market hasn't reacted with extreme negativity to news of its sales, at least not yet. It's feasible that within the next two years, it will return to consistent profitability and hopefully start marking some slightly faster revenue growth.\n\nUntil then, keep an eye on its operating margin. It might be recovering from its lows throughout calendar year 2024, but without a return to its pre-pandemic norm above 3%, the company will continue to be in a state of decline wherein it needs to sell assets to survive.\n\nA major pharmacy chain like Walgreens can survive being in that state for a very long time before it collapses, but even betting for it to make a turnaround will be too uncertain until it has some evidence of such a turnaround in hand.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is near record highs as the stock rally that began in spring 2023 continues. Comprised of 30 leading blue-chip stocks that are representative of the U.S. economy, the index is often referred to as the \u201cDow 30.\u201d While the index might be at record levels, it has reached those heights largely due to the performance of a handful of its 30 stock components.\n\nMost companies listed on the Dow are performing poorly. In fact, despite rising 13% in 2023, the Dow\u2019s gains trailed those of the benchmark S&P 500 index and the technology-heavy Nasdaq index. The reason that the Dow brought up the rear is that the index has very few tech stocks, and even fewer stocks focused on the red hot area of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMost of the stocks in the Dow are in old economy sectors such as oil and gas, finance, and construction. While important, those sectors aren\u2019t driving growth in equities. Here is exit now! Three Dow stocks to sell in February 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nUtilization rate is the problem at UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). The largest healthcare insurer\u2019s stock fell after its recent fourth-quarter 2023 earnings print because the company reported that it is spending more on medical expenses and that\u2019s eating into profits. As with other health insurers, a higher-than-expected utilization rate of medical services by seniors enrolled in U.S. Medicare Advantage plans has become an issue for UnitedHealth. And that news has UNH stock down 4% on the year.\n\nTo be fair, UnitedHealth did manage to beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines with its Q4 2023 financials. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $6.16 and revenue of $94.4 billion. That was better than the consensus forecast of $5.98 in EPS and sales of $92.1 billion. However, it\u2019s not clear when UnitedHealth will get some relief from the higher-than-expected utilization rate for medical services, particularly among aging seniors, and that has soured investors and analysts on the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s never good when a company cuts its dividend payment to stockholders. But when they reduce the dividend by nearly 50%, it\u2019s really bad. Yet that\u2019s what happened at the start of this year when pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) slashed its quarterly dividend payment by almost half. The company said that it is lowering its dividend payout to 25 cents per share from 48 cents previously, a reduction of 48%. That news sparked an immediate selloff in WBA stock.\n\nThe company said the dividend cut was being made to help \u201cstrengthen its long-term balance sheet.\u201d But that explanation provided little comfort to shareholders. Walgreens\u2019 dividend yield is now 4.48% based on the current share price. That\u2019s down from its previous yield of more than 7%, which made Walgreens the highest-paying dividend stock in the Dow 30. It also marked the company\u2019s first dividend cut in nearly 50 years. Year-to-date, WBA stock is down 16%, bringing its loss over the last 12 months to nearly 40%.\n\nNike (NKE) Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocks\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite best efforts, sneaker giant Nike (NYSE:NKE) just can\u2019t seem to get its house in order. The company continues to report a series of disappointing earnings that have kept investors far away from its stock. In 2024, Nike\u2019s share price is flat. However, NKE stock has declined 16% over the past 12 months and is nearly 40% below the all-time high reached in November 2021. The company\u2019s persistent troubles and poor share price performance make Nike a Dow stock to sell in February.\n\nJust before Christmas, NKE stock fell 12% after the company reported mixed financial results and lowered its sales outlook. Nike reported EPS of $1.03 versus 85 cents that had been expected on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $13.39 billion compared to $13.43 billion that was forecast among analysts. Looking ahead, Nike said that it expects full-year revenue to grow only 1%, compared to a prior outlook of about 5% growth.\n\nThe company\u2019s latest plan is to cut costs by $2 billion over three years, mostly through staff layoffs. But it remains to be seen how much that will help. More recently, Nike announced that it was ending its long-term sponsorship of golfer Tiger Woods, adding to the glum sentiment surrounding the stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "A Sustainable Solution, Right There in Black and White",
        "content": "Small tweaks in packaging design add up to big improvements in recyclability for Walgreens brand products.\n\nNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 15, 2024 / Walgreens Boots Alliance\r\nOriginally published by Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nBy Mike Huffman\n\nIn its quest for supporting a healthy planet, Walgreens committed to four goals for its branded products, by 2030: reduce plastic packaging by 30%, make all packaging recyclable, increase recycled content in packaging and eliminate problematic single-use packaging. Significant steps have been taken toward making all packaging recyclable, and part of the progress has come in an unexpected place - nail polish remover bottle caps.\n\nPreferred plastics\n\n\"By switching from black plastic caps to white plastic caps in just these seven Walgreens brand products, we're able to improve the recyclability of a projected 13 tons of plastic,\" says Andrew Horn, senior manager of sustainability operations. \"Many recycling facilities use mechanical vision systems, essentially robots with cameras for eyes, to sort packaging that comes in. They have a difficult time correctly identifying black plastic. So, too often, they'll put it in the waste stream or just inaccurately sort it into the wrong recycling stream.\"\n\nWithin the beauty and personal care products industry, black plastic is commonly used for packaging. Walgreens chose to break away from that norm when the opportunity arose to reduce the negative impacts of plastics in Walgreens brand nail polish remover packaging. Dionne Carloni, manager of packaging sciences, worked with product managers and suppliers to identify recyclable plastic options and put those into use across the beauty and personal care product line.\n\n\"We strive to eliminate carbon black plastic from Walgreens brand packaging whenever possible, even if that means deviating from comparable national brand packaging,\" says Carloni. \"It's a risk because we rely on colors to help our customers navigate to our products, but it's a change we've committed to in order to improve the recyclability of our packaging.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother area with growing success is eliminating the use of PVC plastic commonly seen in \"blister packaging\" - think of toothbrush packages with their cardboard backs and plastic fronts.\n\n\"Recycling centers have an extremely difficult time recycling PVC, and most municipal facilities here in the U.S. don't handle it at all,\" says Horn. \"If we want to be 100% recyclable, we can't use PVC. We take a proactive approach with suppliers when discussing materials, and if they are proposing PVC, we tell them not to. PVC can often be replaced with a PET plastic that's much more recyclable and is indistinguishable to customers.\"\n\nHow 2 Recycle\n\nHowever, it doesn't matter how recyclable the packaging is if it doesn't make it into the recycle bin. That's where the How 2 Recycle product labelling guidelines come in. These easy-to-understand icons, standardized across the U.S. and Canadian packaged goods industry, are typically found on the back or bottom of a product to make it clear what should go into the recycling.\n\n\"We have a lot of success with getting recycling information on our products so consumers know how to dispose our packaging,\" says Carloni. \"We're taking the steps to make our products more recyclable, and then we're giving consumers the information to do it, too.\"\n\nLooking ahead\n\nTo get to the 2030 commitments Walgreens has made, there's more work to be done. But the team is committed and up for the challenge, drawing professional passion from personal experiences.\n\n\"Back when I was in Girl Scouts, we collected newspapers to recycle and measured the saved trees. That experience propelled me towards a path where I actively sought opportunities to contribute to a more sustainable world,\" says Carloni. \"When I started in the packaging field over 15 years ago, sustainability was a really tough path because not a lot of companies had committed to it. I'm glad that progress has been made since then, and I'm really grateful that Walgreens has taken the initiative to push some of these solutions into the marketplace.\"\n\nFor Horn, an avid back-country skier and camper, his love of the outdoors attracted him to his career path that helps create a healthier planet for future generations to enjoy.\n\n\"Saving something, or repurposing, reusing, reducing \u2026 just kind of plays into who I am at my core,\" says Horn. \"I saw this sustainability operations position become available and with my packaging engineering background and material sciences experience, it was the right opportunity for career growth and connected to my interests.\" Now, minimizing the impact of the plastics used in Walgreens brand products and packaging is all in a day's work.\n\nFor more information on WBA's sustainability initiatives please see the latest Environmental, Social & Governance Report.\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Walgreens Boots Alliance on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\r\nSpokesperson: Walgreens Boots Alliance\r\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/walgreens-boots-alliance\r\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com",

Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Michael Hawthorne\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Agree Realty's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Before turning the call over to Joey and Peter to discuss our results for the quarter, let me first run through the cautionary language.\r\nPlease note that during this call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking under federal securities law. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements for a number of reasons. Please see yesterday's earnings release and our SEC filings including our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of various risks and uncertainties underlying our forward-looking statements. \r\nIn addition, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including core funds from operations or core FFO, and adjusted funds from operations or AFFO, and net debt to recurring EBITDA. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release, website and SEC filings. \r\nI'll now turn the call over to Joey.\n\nStory continues\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nThank you, Brian. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that 2023 was another strong year for our company. Looking back on the past year, we executed several strategic initiatives that positioned our company for continued success. In anticipation of capital markets volatility, we pre-equitized our balance sheet in the fourth quarter of 2022 with $560 million of forward equity raised at a net price of just over $67.50. While at the time, many thought our mindset was conservative, we were confident that while interest rates rose rapidly, cap rates would be slow to exhibit expansion in our large illiquid and fragmented space.\r\nWe were determined to avoid deviating from our core strategy for providing debt financing, expanding into new verticals or going up the risk curve either via credit or tenant concentrations. Instead, we continue to execute our disciplined and time-tested strategy of investing in the country's biggest and best retailers. Those that have the balance sheet to invest in price, labor and fulfillment while creating a unique value proposition for customers.\r\nWhile the performance of our stock has certainly been frustrating, we have not wavered. Management and our tremendous Board of Directors put their money where their mouths are with almost $12 million of insider purchases during 2023.\r\nNet lease is a long-term business. We believe in consistency, reliability and quality of cash flows will ultimately lead to outperformance. While we can't control macroeconomic volatility, we can execute with a mindset of value creation, not simply short-term earnings accretion.\r\nThe days of free money and ubiquitous capital were behind us, which made a strong and strategic change in capital allocation philosophy. We have seen the result of investing at de-minimis spreads. It drives little to no AFFO per share growth. In this new economic paradigm, our focus is on achieving outsized investment spreads and the best risk-adjusted opportunities, not simply aggregating volume. We will not grow the denominator without driving meaningful AFFO per share growth, nor will we move up the risk curve to create short-term opportunities and growth. We are laser focused on allocating capital in a disciplined manner to drive growth that is sustainable.\r\nOn last quarter's call, we outlined the do-nothing scenario in which we would drive over 3% AFFO per share growth in 2024 with conservative assumptions and the absence of external growth. With over $235 million of forward equity raise at the end of the year and anticipated free cash flow of approximately $100 million, we have visibility beyond the do-nothing scenario. We can invest approximately $500 million this year on a leverage-neutral basis, excluding any disposition proceeds and without the need for any additional equity capital.\r\nMost importantly, we remain nimble and opportunistic, ensuring we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities as we uncover them. With over $1 billion of total liquidity, including the outstanding forward equity raise in the fourth quarter, we have ample runway and complete optionality. In addition, we have no material debt maturities until 2028 and pro forma net debt to EBITDA stood at just 4.3x at year-end.\r\nOur fortress balance sheet is paired with a best-in-class portfolio and our record investment-grade exposure of over 69% provides for highly durable cash flows in today's dynamic environment. The strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our portfolio are evidenced by the positive outlook that S&P placed on their BBB credit rating last week. We believe that our credit metrics are emblematic of a higher rated company and the positive outlook is another step in gaining recognition for the manner in which we operate our company and manage our balance sheet.\r\nMoving on to our standard update. This past quarter, we worked through significant market turbulence and ultimately invested nearly $200 million in 70 high-quality retail net lease properties across our 3 external growth platforms. This included the acquisition of 50 properties for over $187 million. The properties acquired during the fourth quarter leased to leading operators in sectors, including home improvement, farm and roll supply, off-price, tire and auto service as well as convenience stores.\r\nAs our fourth quarter activity demonstrated, we can continue to push cap rates higher, piercing 7% for the first time since 2019. The acquired properties had a weighted average cap rate of 7.2%, a 30 basis point expansion relative to the third quarter and 80 basis points higher than the prior year. The weighted average lease term was 10.1 years and approximately 71% of annualized base rents were derived from investment-grade retailers.\r\nWe acquired 7 ground leases during the quarter, representing approximately $30 million or 14.8% of total acquisition volume for the quarter. In 2023, we invested more than $1.3 billion and 319 retail net lease properties spanning 41 states. We continue to leverage all 3 external growth platforms to find compelling risk-adjusted opportunities.\r\nFor the full year, nearly 74% of the annualized base rents acquired were from investment-grade retailers, while ground leases represented almost 9% of rents acquired. \r\nNotably, we increased sale-leaseback activity in 2023, partnering with leading operators in the farm and rural supply and convenience store sectors. Sale leasebacks represented 1/3 of our acquisition activity in 2023, compared to just over 10% in the year prior, further demonstrating our ability to be a full-service comprehensive real estate solution for our retail partners.\r\nSwitching to our Development and DFP platforms. We had a record year with 37 projects either completed or under construction, representing approximately $150 million of committed capital. We're continuing to see increased activity across both platforms as we work with our retail partners to help them execute their store growth plans and provide struggling merchant developers with the ability to lock in funding for their pipeline.\r\nWe commenced 4 new development and DFP projects during the fourth quarter with total anticipated cost of approximately $13 million. The new projects include a Burlington and HomeGoods in Yuma, Arizona and 2 Starbucks in Illinois. Construction continued during the quarter on 12 projects with anticipated costs totaling approximately $51 million.\r\nLastly, we completed construction on 4 projects during the quarter with total costs of approximately $16 million. We disposed 5 properties during 2023 for total gross proceeds of approximately $10 million, including 3 properties that were sold during the fourth quarter. The weighted average cap rate for dispositions in 2023 was 6.1%. I anticipate additional opportunistic dispositions in 2024 as we will seek to sell assets at attractive cap rates and redeploy that capital on an accretive basis.\r\nOn the leasing front, we executed new leases, extensions or options on 425,000 square feet of gross leasable area during the fourth quarter. Including a T.J.Maxx in New Lenox, Illinois, and a Walmart Supercenter in Hazard, Kentucky. \r\nFor the full year 2023, we executed new leases, extensions or options on approximately 1.9 million square feet of GLA. We are in a great position for 2024 with only 28 leases or 110 basis points of annualized base rents maturing.\r\nAt year-end, our best-in-class portfolio spanned 2,135 properties across 49 states, including 224 ground leases representing 11.7% of total annualized base rents. Occupancy ticked up slightly to 99.8%. And again, our investment-grade exposure reached a record of over 69%.\r\nLastly, I'd like to welcome Linglong He to our Board of Directors. Linglong was Rocket's first software engineer over 25 years ago and today serves as a Chief Leadership Adviser for Rocket Central where she is responsible for executive leadership development for the Rocket companies. Prior to that role, she served as Chief Information Officer of Rocket Mortgage, one of the nation's largest mortgage lenders for 10 years. Linglong has over 25 years of experience, technology and leadership, and we're truly excited to add her expertise to our esteemed Board of Directors. \r\nI'll now hand the call over to Peter, and then we can open it up for questions.\n\nPeter Coughenour\n\nThank you, Joey. Starting with earnings. Core FFO per share was $0.99 for the fourth quarter and $3.93 per share for full year 2023, representing 3.4% and 1.6% year-over-year increases, respectively. AFFO per share was $1 for the fourth quarter and $3.95 for the full year, representing 5.2% and 3.1% year-over-year increases, respectively. As a reminder, treasury stock is included in our diluted share count prior to settlement if ADC stock trades above the deal price of our outstanding forward equity offerings. The aggregate dilutive impact related to these offerings was approximately [$0.05] for the full year.\r\nOur consistent and reliable earnings growth continues to support a growing and well-covered dividend. During the fourth quarter, we declared monthly cash dividends of $0.247 per share for October, November and December. On an annualized basis, the monthly dividends represent a 2.9% year-over-year increase.\r\nFor the full year, the company declared dividends of approximately $2.92 per share, a 4.1% increase year-over-year and almost a 12% increase on a 2-year stack basis. Our payout ratios for the fourth quarter and full year remained at or below the low end of our targeted range of 75% to 85% of AFFO per share. Subsequent to year-end, we declared a monthly cash dividend of $0.247 per share for January and February 2024. The monthly dividends reflect an annualized dividend amount of over $2.96 per share or a 2.9% increase over the annualized dividend amount of $2.88 per share from the first quarter of 2023.\r\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased quarter-over-quarter to 5.7% of revenue, adjusted for the noncash amortization of above and below market lease intangibles. For the year, G&A expense totaled $34.8 million or 6.1% of adjusted revenue. With our continued investments in systems, including ongoing enhancements to our proprietary ARC database, we anticipate that G&A expense will continue to scale as a percentage of adjusted revenue in 2024.\r\nWe recorded $709,000 of income tax expense during the fourth quarter. This brings the total for the year to $2.9 million, near the midpoint of our guidance.\r\nTurning to our capital markets activities. We raised over $370 million of gross equity proceeds during the year via the forward component of our ATM program. With more than $235 million of forward equity raised late in the fourth quarter, we anticipate putting in place a new ATM program in the coming weeks in normal course. \r\nWe also demonstrated our ability to access attractive bank debt with a market-leading $350 million 5.5-year term loan at a fixed rate of 4.52% inclusive of prior hedging activity. The term loan received strong support from our key banking relationships and the 5.5-year term allowed us to extend the maturity into 2029. As Joey mentioned, our debt maturity schedule remains in an excellent position with no material maturities until 2028.\r\nOur capital markets activity further fortified our balance sheet and positioned us for continued growth in 2024. We ended the year with over $1 billion of total liquidity, including more than $235 million of outstanding forward equity, $773 million of availability on the revolver and approximately $15 million of cash on hand. \r\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility and term loan have accordion options, allowing us to request additional lender commitments of $750 million and $150 million, respectively.\r\nIn addition to our strong liquidity position, free cash flow after the dividend is now approaching $100 million on an annualized basis. As of December 31, pro forma for the settlement of our outstanding forward equity, net debt to recurring EBITDA was approximately 4.3x. Excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity, our net debt to recurring EBITDA was 4.7x. Our total debt to enterprise value was approximately 27%, while our fixed charge coverage ratio, which includes principal amortization in the preferred dividend is in a very healthy position at 5x. \r\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Joey.\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nThank you, Peter. To summarize, we are very well positioned to execute in 2024 to drive sustainable earnings and a growing and well-covered dividend. At this time, operator, let's open it up for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Spenser Allaway of Green Street Advisors.\n\nSpenser Bowes Allaway\n\nGiven that you guys have capital locked in and as you mentioned, you have a very strong liquidity position. Why not provide some formal acquisition guidance at this time?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nSpenser, so I think, first of all, we're in an extremely volatile macroeconomic environment, including interest rate volatility here that's going on. And so I think our #1 focus is not going to be aggregating volume today at de minimis spreads, as we talked about in the prepared remarks. We're 100% focused and the team is disciplined here, focusing on deploying capital at 100-plus basis point spreads into our sandbox of the country's leading retailers. And frankly, with 70 days of visibility in the net lease space, that's our average duration from letter of intent to close, I can't tell you what's going to happen in 71 days, let alone later the summer or fall.\n\nSpenser Bowes Allaway\n\nOkay. And then as you think about the 3 different kind of investment verticals that you play in, can you just talk about where you're seeing the best spreads today?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nWell, the best spreads, of course, would be in development, right? Duration -- development duration, we don't take speculative risk in terms of acquiring land or specking buildings without a tenant in hand without that being fully bid and all permits secured. So the best risks -- excuse me, the best returns would, of course, be on the development spectrum. And so duration equals risk. So we're looking for a significant spread if we're going to develop to where we can acquire a light-kind asset.\r\nAnd the other end of the spectrum would be acquisitions. Again, where our focus here is deploying capital 100 basis points wide of where we see our cost of capital. And as we've noted significantly before, our cost of capital, we perceive it as a forward AFFO yield at a 75/25 split with 10-year unsecured pricing. We're not using unburdened free cash flow here. It's a conservative approach to that cost of capital. But our goal, again, is to deploy that capital 100 basis points wide of that.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from Smedes Rose of Citigroup.\n\nSmedes Rose\n\nSo I get -- you don't want to provide a full year kind of outlook and thinking about acquisition activity. But could you maybe just talk about what you've seen kind of year-to-date and kind of where cap rates have moved -- have been moved up sequentially from the fourth quarter where you were able to lock in at 7.2%. Maybe just a little color on kind of what you're seeing near term?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nSure. Smedes, I would tell you, cap rates right now are all over the board given the volatility in the underlying markets that we see and the interest rate. Fourth quarter was a roller coaster. Obviously, we saw the base rate for the world go up 25% from 4% to 5% in 70 days, then dropped 28% over the subsequent 21 days this morning. I'm not sure what it's going to do or what goals be and all the Fed speakers are going to say. I think it's more likely that we get a rate hike this year than a cut in March at this point.\r\nAnd so cap rates are all over the board, as you would imagine that sellers' expectations of the overall economy and interest rate environment all over the board. What I will tell you is building upon my last answer, that 100 basis point spread to where -- we see our cost of capital will result in a material jump in our cap rates in Q1, 30 to 40 basis points most likely, still focusing a 30 to 40 basis points jump over Q4. Again, without sacrificing credit quality. And that will be an aggregation on the acquisition side of unique opportunities, short-term blend and extend opportunities, high-performing stores directed by our retail partners and asymmetric opportunities.\r\nBut the market in terms of transactional volume is effectively fractional of where it was historically. And sellers' expectations are all over the board. And so we really don't have -- unfortunately, when the 10-year was at 4% early in the fourth quarter, we were approaching it. It seems like a new normal of 4% 10-year. Since then, obviously, the volatility has got some consternation -- some hope amongst borrowers that kind of vacillates back and forth.\n\nSmedes Rose\n\nOkay. And then I just wanted to ask, you mentioned G&A expense will continue to move up as a percent of revenue. Do you just have a -- do you have a sense of kind of what percentage that we should expect that to move to over the course of '24?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nSo embedded in our guidance -- I'll let Peter add any color, embedded in our base case of over 3% AFFO growth, which clearly is off the table right now given the forward equity that we've raised and the color I've given on the pipeline, the percentage of G&A of revenue will go down. The absolute number we anticipate going up because auditors, professional services and everything else continues to go up in this world. Peter, anything I'm missing?\n\nPeter Coughenour\n\nNo, that's correct. I think in recent years, we've seen scale in G&A as a percent of adjusted revenue of approximately 40 or 50 basis points on an annual basis on average. It's difficult at this point to predict how much scale we'll see in 2024, but we do anticipate that G&A as a percentage of revenue will continue to come down.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from Ki Bin Kim of Truist.\n\nKi Bin Kim\n\nSo first question, I noticed you guys have about 10 Big Lots. So a question is about your guidance. And I think you embedded about 50 basis points credit loss reserves. So curious how much of that accounts for the known or highly likely move out versus the unknown and Big Lots, what is that as a percent of ABR please?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nYes. So our total watch list today is approximately inclusive of any Big Lots exposure or any At Home exposure where we have won, these are real estate plays for us at the end of the day. You can take a look at our At Home in Provo, Utah. That's a real estate play across a mall that's undergoing renovation with a new large format target. .\r\nBig Lots, we continue to monitor. It's an immaterial piece of our overall, obviously, portfolio, and it's embedded in that 1% approximately watch list with -- amongst At Home. And so I'll give you an example. We had 1 Big Lots that didn't renew. We just -- we're at lease right now with a national retailer in the auto parts space, a great partner of ours for approximately a 5% lift on the NOI on a 15-year new base term. So we're very comfortable with our exposures and frankly, the underlying real estate here. So again, that total watch list that we're focused on is basically 1% and a lot of it, frankly, we want back.\n\nKi Bin Kim\n\nOkay. And the Big Lots ABR percentage?\n\nPeter Coughenour\n\nYes. Ki Bin, it's sub-50 basis points today in terms of our overall exposure to Big Lots. And I'd also note, on average, to Joey's point, in terms of being comfortable with the basis, they're paying just over $6 per square foot on average.\n\nKi Bin Kim\n\nOkay. And I appreciate your comments about being more disciplined on capital deployment if the pricing doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Since your last equity raise, obviously, your stock price has drifted slightly lower. So if you had to raise a new round of equity today, and if you still want to hold on to the 100 basis point spread target, it would imply that you would probably have to buy something closer to an 8% GAAP cap rate. I'm not sure if there's enough desirable product at those prices, so if you can provide some commentary? And if that is the case, like would you just be comfortable slowing down the acquisition pace again?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nWell, we started the year by putting out a base. We started the year -- last year by putting out a base case with no investment volume with over 3% AFFO growth with those conservative inputs that we just went through and Peter gave more descriptive analysis too. So we will not put out capital south of that 100 basis point spread unless it is a unique compelling opportunity a mark-to-market or something that justifies -- has the merits to justify that business case.\r\nAnd so where our stock price is, where stock price goes, where cap rates go, I'll be honest, I don't anticipate material expansion throughout the course of the year, absent more economic macro volatility -- incrementally more volatility than we see now. This is a large liquid fragmented space. Our focus is, again, is being 100% focused and disciplined on deploying that capital, a material accretive spread. This business is very simple. And a forward AFFO yield, if you deploy capital inside of that forward AFFO yield, it does not work. Forget that. I don't care for using overnight paper. We price our cost of capital using 25% 10-year unsecured bonds. That's how we look at our cost of capital. \r\nBut if you're deploying capital inside of your forward AFFO yield, it's not going to work and it's going to drive no shareholder accretion on an AFFO per share basis. And so we're not going to be out there collecting nuts, growing our denominator, not driving per share value and per share growth for our shareholders. The relationship between cap rates and volume at the end of the day is exponential and not linear.\r\nAnd so again, people have heard me say, inside of 75 basis points is the red light. We've seen the anecdotal evidence as well as the empirical evidence of some large volume numbers not producing annualized growth in the subsequent year. 75 to 100 basis points is a yellow light in this business. You could invest selectively. Over 100 basis points when you look at your true cost of capital, not including unburdened free cash flow or short-term debt the light become start to be turned green. If you get to 150 basis points, you can slam on the gas like we did for several years. \r\nWe're not at that 150 basis point space in this market today, unless you want to go significantly up the risk curve, which is adverse to everything we believe in at this company. And so that 100 basis point bogey, -- not sure how much we're going to be able to aggregate for the year. I don't have that crystal ball, but we're certainly not going to deploy capital inside of it, just to grow our denominator in our asset base.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nThis is (inaudible) on behalf of Josh. I know you already made some a few comments about your development pipeline. I was curious, I know over 2022, 2023, it was about say, like a 23% increase. Is it fair to assume maybe a comparable amount going into 2024 for a total amount of development?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nWe are consistently and constantly answering the phones and responding to inquiries from merchant developers from retailers, from all different types of constituents given the lack of liquidity out there in the construction lending market and the lack of ability for merchant builders to develop net new stores. Where that number ends up this year is going to be frankly subject to where we can get returns. We're just not going to grow that number to put shovels in the ground, take duration risk and not provide for the appropriate levels of ultimate accretion on our deployed capital.\r\nSo it's difficult to say where that will go. It can change by the day. We announced a number of new projects as well as completed in this quarter. Our pipeline continues to grow the pace at which it grows, it's really up in the air. Retailers want to grow today. That's the ultimate bottom line. As the retailers in our portfolio, inclusive of Walmart, who just announced a slew of new stores really since the first time -- since the GFC want to grow today. \r\nThe question is construction costs, availability of capital, return on cost and what rent per square foot they can pay. And so calibrating those things ultimately our goal is to calibrate those things and figure out what projects make sense for us with those retail partners. What that number is, again, I wish I had that visibility.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nGreat. And I believe this is along the lines of what you were just mentioning that last quarter, -- you made some comments about partnering up with retailers to kind of assist with bringing stores to close. Is there any other further update on that?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nContinued discussion. The team is at 2 national retailers that you're familiar with today and tomorrow, frankly, we're constantly in dialogue trying to help break this logjam that's occurring right now in the development of new stores. That said, we're not going to do it, obviously, to the detriment of our shareholders. We're going to get the appropriate spreads.\r\nSo the dialogue is ongoing. It is very fluid, as you can imagine, with the world going inside out in the fourth quarter. But we're going to continue to have those conversations, and I think our full-service value proposition is -- I know it is. I know it is unique to retailers and they appreciate all of our capabilities, inclusive of our asset management capabilities.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from Rob Stevenson of Janney.\n\nRobert Chapman Stevenson\n\nCan you talk about what the cash spread on leasing done in the fourth quarter and for '23 as a whole was? And have the size of the bumps or other lease terms change given the persistently higher inflation these days?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nOn the first one, Peter, do you have a number handy, I mean it's fairly de minimis.\n\nPeter Coughenour\n\nYes, Rob, I would just say first that we don't have a ton of actually re-leasing activity in our portfolio. The vast majority of leases that are up for expiration so the tenant exercise an option, which typically has an embedded bump within that option. That said, the recapture rate for Q4 and for the full year was north of 100%.\n\nRobert Chapman Stevenson\n\nOkay. And then what about the lease terms? Are you guys trying to push higher bumps, more frequent bumps, et cetera, given the higher inflation or trying to mitigate people to CPI. How are you guys thinking about that as you're starting new leases on any of these development deals or any of the other stuff?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nYes. So no national retailers will generally echo as to CPI-based bumps. They want to know what the rent is going to be on a go-forward basis so they can plan -- but yes, I mean, that's thematic since we've seen inflation at 8%, 9%, let alone over 3%, that everybody is I think understanding that we're in an inflationary environment. And so the frequency as well as the size of those bumps, I think most tenants are amenable to relooking at their lease terms there.\n\nRobert Chapman Stevenson\n\nOkay. And then can you talk about the difference between cap rates on ground leases in the fourth quarter for the year overall versus the fee simple acquisitions. Is that spread sort of stayed relatively consistent? Are you seeing better opportunities or less opportunities in ground leases today and going forward? How should we be thinking about that?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nVery, very consistent, if any -- a de minimis spread between the ground leases and net leases, we're generally working with our retail partners there. I think you'll see more of the same in the first quarter. Some of them are shorter term, some of them are targeted by retailers in partnership with us. So very de minimis spread, I think.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho.\n\nHaendel Emmanuel St. Juste\n\nJoey, I think you mentioned earlier in the call that you're anticipating -- let's see -- opportunities dispositions this year. Curious what categories you want client to call potentially how much you like to call in potential range of cap rates or any pricing color expectations?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nYes. I would tell you, from a category perspective, we're not overly interested in decreasing our Walmart exposure or anything like that. The opportunistic dispositions will generally be into the pretty tenuous 1031 market dominated in markets where you have significant capital, it seems to be significant capital, still chasing things at fairly low yields. We'll look to deploy -- redeploy that capital at approximately 150 basis point spreads. You can see it in the auto service space. You can see it amongst other categories, the farm and rural supply space, the car wash space, potentially -- generally spaces where we're very comfortable with our exposure, but there is still opportunistic, maybe tax-motivated purchasers out there in geographies, which seem to still have heat to them.\n\nHaendel Emmanuel St. Juste\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And then just going back to the messaging here. Clearly, you're guiding to a capital light deployment, earnings growth, minimum 3, probably looks like 4% now expecting interest rates to be higher for longer. So I guess I'm curious, kind of from your perspective, what's the investment case for investors buying the stock here today, 3% to 4% earnings growth isn't too shabby in this environment, I get it, but still likely to lag a number of your peers, I think, are we basically in a wait-and-see mode to a degree here?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nSo let's take a step back. We have a 5% plus and growing dividend that's covered at the low end of our target payout ratio of 75%. We have a 5-year CAGR of 6% AFFO growth while qualitatively improving the portfolio to now approaching 70% investment grade and 12% ground leases. It is the strongest retail portfolio, I think, without exception in the country and most investors and analysts would agree.\r\nWe have a balance sheet that is fortified with $1 billion of liquidity has no material debt maturities until 2028, no floating rate exposure except anything outstanding on the line of credit. So if you take your 3% to 4%, you can go ahead and take the high end, then take the 5% and growing dividend, you're at 9% total returns there alone, assuming no dividend growth, which it will grow this year with an underlying fortress balance sheet and an underlying fortress portfolio. I think that is a very compelling case in today's environment to invest in ADC. And I think, as I said in our prepared remarks, insiders here, inclusive of myself, agree. \r\nWhat we have done and what we have built without diminishing the qualitative aspect of our portfolio, is, I think, is without peer. We haven't loaded up on pharmacies. We've ran from Walgreens exposure. We don't have double-digit pharmacy exposure and double-digit dollar store exposure. We're not just out there checking the IG box. We've been talking about Walgreens now for years, reducing our Walgreens exposure to an inconsequential number, watching CVS overtake Walgreens in the pharmacy space.\r\nI think we have a proven track record now of not only being correct in our retail predictions and predilections about the concerns in an omnichannel world, but we also have the balance sheet management, the earnings growth profile to, frankly -- to bank on. And so I think there's something to be said, especially in today's environment for stability and predictability.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from Mitch Germain of JP (sic) [JMP] Securities.\n\nMitchell Bradley Germain\n\nI know it's early in the year, but I'm just curious if you're seeing any changes to the buyer pool?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nMitch, honestly no. I mean this market is so fragmented and large to begin with, that you stress it in a higher interest rate environment and in a liquid credit environment, the buyer pool kind of becomes a toss-up in the air. So it's very difficult. I mean sometimes I'll be honest, I'll ask an investment or disposition committee, who is this? Who is buying this? Who is selling this? And the answer turns into something like a riddle. .\r\nAnd so I'll be honest, it's -- there is -- there are no parallels to be drawn. There is not a fluid market right now. It is hit or miss. It's about being disciplined and it's about throwing darts and being decisive in what you want to accomplish.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from R.J. Milligan of Raymond James.\n\nRichard Jon Milligan\n\nSo I just want to follow up. I think Smedes asked this. I'm not sure if you provided an answer in terms of what the year-to-date activity has been so far?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nNo. We haven't provided any answer or any update on the year-to-date activity. Although I did mention that we anticipate cap rates jumping in Q1 by approximately 30 to 40 basis points on the acquisition side.\n\nRichard Jon Milligan\n\nGot it. And so I know there's a difference between capital previously raised, right, via the ATM last quarter versus trying to go out and raise new capital -- equity capital today. So I'm just curious if you are seeing that or 7.5% average cap rate or that cap rate expansion, would the goal then be to deploy the Q4 ATM proceeds quickly I guess, what is the outlook for cap rates? Is it going to deploy at a 7.5% today, given that, that's a pretty high absolute cap rate? Or is it still more of a wait and see even with the previously raised proceeds?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nYes. Just to clarify, that's not market. These are manufactured transactions where we work out there creating value. That is nowhere near market cap rates today on a like-kind product. We're not out there buying glossy brochures here that are highly marketed and sent through the auction process. And so if we can achieve those types of cap rates, we'll look at that spread relative to our cost of capital, deploy that equity. But I think as we highlighted, we have $500 million in leverage-neutral buying power today, not inclusive of any disposition proceeds. And so as the year materializes, again, as the pipeline and the pipeline grows, we'll look at all capital options for us, but we don't need to do anything today. I think that's pretty clear with $1 billion of liquidity and that $500 million in leverage neutral power.\n\nRichard Jon Milligan\n\nAnd just 1 follow-up. So Joey, you've talked a lot or very often about the lack of visibility 70 days, however, you have been able to provide, despite that lack of visibility as sort of a guidepost at least for acquisition volume. I understand that we are in a volatile capital markets environment. I'm just curious, what do you need to see in the capital markets or the transaction market to get the confidence to resume an external growth guideposts?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nI think we have to get to a level of normalcy again. I think we have to get to a level of stability in the underlying macroeconomic environment. I mean, I haven't -- I'd be honest, I haven't seen an economist who's gotten this right since we pumped $6.5 trillion into the economy and lowered rates to 0. And so for us to sit here and me specifically to sit here as a [dumb] real estate guy and try to anticipate what's going to materialize over the course of the next 11 months during this year, I would frankly be getting ahead of myself.\r\nAnd so we were able to provide those historic guidepost because we had a level of visibility into anything absent in aberration or geopolitical event or some type of crash today with the underlying volatility that we're seeing in these markets and frankly, the lack of clarity we're seeing in these markets, I mean, it's a foggy world out there today. And so when we get and if we get that level of clarity based upon that stability, we will 100% provide it. But I think anything -- if we did anything else, we would just be getting ahead of ourselves.\n\nRichard Jon Milligan\n\nOne additional is clearly, you guys have been pretty proactive in selling down your Walgreens exposure over time. I'm curious if there's any other categories that you're looking to sort of get ahead of the curve over the next year or 2?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nNot really from a category perspective. We saw something very specific with Walgreens in context of the pharmacy space, the degradation of the front end, the constant need and desire to do M&A to increase store count, which didn't make sense to us the failure of Walgreens to repurpose the front end of the store with their attempts at beauty and fragrance. Their attempted to (inaudible) we saw that very specifically. And frankly, we had an overabundance of Walgreens exposure. I mean it was 45% Walgreens exposure in 2012, I think, approximately. In 2013, we were 45% Walgreens exposure and -- we had a lot of intimate experience developing approximately 40 to 50 of them in 6 states. And so that was abundantly clear to us watching those stores erode.\r\nI'll tell you, today, the retailers in our portfolio are generally doing really well and are really healthy. Now we stayed away from the casual dining space. We've stayed away from the experiential stuff and we'll continue to. But if you look at our portfolio today, the retailers are really doing well. The bigger getting bigger, they're getting stronger. They're investing in price, labor and distribution and then figuring out how to drive EBITDA in this omnichannel world.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Linda Tsai of Jefferies.\n\nLinda Tsai\n\nRegarding what you referred to as manufactured cap rates in 1Q being up 40, 50 bps through the auction process. Any more color on how you drive that level of expansion and how easy or difficult it is to achieve this?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nYes. Just to clarify, those cap rates are effectively us creating value out there, seeking off-market opportunities, blend and extend opportunities. These aren't highly marketed glossy brochure through national brokers. We're working with our retail partners to find opportunities where they want to be there long term, and we want to be their landlord long term you. \r\nWhat was the -- would you repeat the second part of that question?\n\nLinda Tsai\n\nJust how easy it is to -- or difficult to achieve this and -- its sustainability?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nNot easy. Look, this is -- I don't think anything is easy in this world today. It takes grit. That's one of our core values here. Greatness requires grit. It takes grit. We leverage our relationships. The team here has tremendous relationships and credibility with retailers. We aren't in the wholesale buying process anymore out there that's going -- given where cost of capital are. But I'm 100% confident that the team will continue to be able to uncover opportunities across all 3 external growth platforms that provides outsized returns relative both to the market and hopefully, our own internal expectations.\n\nLinda Tsai\n\nAnd then if sale leaseback was 1/3 of the acquisition volume, what can it grow to in '24? And similarly, where can DFP grow to as a percentage of the volume?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nFrom a sale leaseback perspective, any tenant that doesn't need capital, and those are the only tenants that we typically do business with, we don't want to become a large unsecured creditor to any retailer that's private equity sponsors. So if you looked at the retailers, we did sale leaseback, they're on pause, right? Their CFOs, their real estate departments are watching the volatility. They know where they can issue paper, in the unsecured market today, they're waiting for things to settle down here as well. And so I wouldn't anticipate given today's status quo, that number approaching 1/3. It's fully possible if we get stabilization later in the year.\r\nIn terms of DFP, every day, it changes. We have built that team out. We've built that system out in context of ARC. We have improved and made our processes more efficient. Again, it's just a question of pricing. And the pricing is both with the developers as well as the retailers, the returns they're willing to accept and ultimately, the rents they're able to pay on those specific sites. And if it works in context of our -- obviously return profile.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley.\n\nZhen Li\n\nJoey and Peter, you have Jenny on for Ron.\r\nI just have 2 quick questions. The first is, can you talk a little bit on the competition environment today for the IG focused market? And you mentioned like transaction volume is kind of low, like this year. But if you compare on a year-over-year basis, is that like getting worse or it's actually better than last year?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nCompetition in our specific sandbox is really hit or miss, right? There are the random and infrequent 1031 or high net worth individuals. They tell you the competition is very similar to what it was historically, except the amount of competition. The composition is similar, but the amount of competition, given just the transactional slowdown, the 1031 slowdown is very de minimis. And so I often say our largest competitors are sellers' expectations themselves.\r\nWould you repeat the second part of that question?\n\nZhen Li\n\nThe second is the transaction volumes. You mentioned like the transaction volume this year is kind of low, but if you compare on a year-over-year basis, it's actually better than last year or actually worse than last year?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nWell, the transaction volume in terms of closed acquisitions?\n\nZhen Li\n\nOf the pipelines and just overall?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nWe're still early. Look, we have visibility into the Q1 pipeline. We're just starting to build Q2, transaction volume for Q1 will be down year-over-year relative to Q1 undoubtedly. But as I mentioned, our focus is on improving those cap rates very significantly on a relative year-over-year basis.\r\nSo I think looking forward, again, we'll see what type of normalcy we get or stabilization we get in the underlying macro. It's difficult -- it's very difficult to predict, impossible for us.\n\nZhen Li\n\nYes, it makes sense. If you talk about dispositions, I think you mentioned you're expecting to dispose more this year. And based on your target cap rates, do you think -- just maybe talk a little bit more about like the disposition cap rate is trending in the overall environment?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nYes. We're looking for those opportunistic areas where we can sell an asset generally in -- plus or minus in the 6 cap range and then redeploy it north of 100 basis points, minimally above that in assets that we don't think long term necessarily have the growth potential profile that -- within the portfolio.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from [Alex Hagan] of Baird.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nFirst off, where are the current yields on the new development funding deals?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nWhen you say new development funding deals, I mean, generally, we're targeting new -- net new in terms of approvals and starting now, we're targeting the DFP transaction that is let's call it, 6 months until rent commencement, approximately 50 to 75 basis points over lifetime cap rates in the acquisition. If it's an overall project that takes entitlements, we're significantly wide of that just because of the duration risk.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nOkay. And I guess, second, you kind of put on your macro hat earlier said you think the chance of a rate hike is -- might be higher now than a rate cut kind of curious what's the most attractive source of debt today? And does the company have any plans on issuing long-term debt to reduce the revolver anytime soon?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nYes. Just, I'll let Peter answer the second question. I said just to repeat, the change of rate hike is probably better than this year is probably better than the chance of a rate cut in March. We'll see more data, obviously, tomorrow. But I think that rate cut expectation that the market had for March is clearly off the table, and we'll see if we get any more hot prints that come out. Peter, in terms of the debt market, I'll let you take that.\n\nPeter Coughenour\n\nYes. I think -- we came into this year with $1 billion of total liquidity available to us. And so there's no near-term need to access the debt markets. We have no material debt maturities until 2028. And so we can continue to be opportunistic in terms of how and when we access the debt capital markets.\r\nWe have access to both the unsecured markets as well as the bank debt markets where we continue to have strong support from our bank group. I think our preference is typically for longer-term fixed rate unsecured financings that match the underlying lease duration of our portfolio. And to that end, as disclosed in the 10-K, we entered into $150 million of forward starting swaps during the fourth quarter. Those swaps contemplated a future 10-year unsecured debt issuance, and they're swapped at an effective rate just under 4%. So we have optionality in terms of when we use those swaps. They have a mandatory termination date in June of '25, but contemplates us coming back to that market at some point in the future.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Eric Borden of BMO Capital Markets.\n\nEric Martin Borden\n\nJust a quick 1 on the watch list. What's the mark-to-market on the assets in there today? I think you mentioned Big Lots expiring or taking back space in the mid-single digits. Just curious about the rest of the portfolio?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nThe Big Lots expiration that I mentioned, which was now at least within auto parts, that mark-to-market is approximately 5% on a new 15-year lease. In reference to where we think the remainder of the overall portfolio is?\n\nEric Martin Borden\n\nJust the remainder of the -- the portion of the portfolio that is on the watch list or base that you anticipate taking back?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nI'd tell you, we're extremely comfortable given the rental rates that we've acquired across those, we're extremely comfortable. Again, these are mid-single-digit rental rates today to even build a box like that is [$160, $150] vertical a foot. These are mid-single-digit rental rates that we feel extremely comfortable that if we were to get any of these boxes back that we'll have no challenge here marking them to market where market is, it varies across the board, but to find any box today that has any merit to it in mid-single-digit range is almost impossible.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Connor Siversky of Wells Fargo.\n\nJesus Garcia\n\nJesus on for Connor this morning. Just in your conversations with tenants, can you offer a temperature check on the willingness for some of these retail operations to continue to expand in this current macro backdrop?\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nYes, as I touched on earlier, the retailers that we talk to want to continue to expand and -- continue to expand aggressively. I don't remember a time when Home Depot, Walmart and Lowe's before except it prior to the GFC, we're expanding the large-format C-stores, the auto parts operators, the off-price retailers, it's all the TJX concepts, Ross, Burlington, Five Below. These operators are have the desire to continue to expand across all of their different flags. And again, the challenge today is construction costs and ultimately, what they can pay on a per square foot rental rate. But there is voracious demand in the discount space, again, we're focused in the necessity-based arena here. It is a voracious demand to continue to expand and open stores. We're seeing that really across the board, whether it's all the way from O'Reilly and AutoZone to tracker supply to Walmart to ALDI, which is obviously making a large acquisition and opening net new stores. I think you see that across the area in terms of discount-oriented operators.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joey Agree for any closing remarks.\n\nJoel N. Agree\n\nWell, thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us this morning, and we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming conferences. We appreciate everybody's time.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

        "content": "The Walgreens Deans Advisory Council will collaborate to address key issues, including staffing challenges and decreasing pharmacy school enrollment\n\nOriginally published by Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nDEERFIELD, IL / ACCESSWIRE / February 13, 2024 / As a trusted, convenient local healthcare destination that millions of Americans rely on every day, Walgreens is expanding its long-standing relationships with colleges of pharmacy through the formation of the Walgreens Deans Advisory Council to enhance the pharmacy profession and better support pharmacists as they provide valuable care to their local communities.\n\nThe new Council, consisting of 17 pharmacy school deans and Walgreens leadership, is sponsored by Rick Gates, Chief Pharmacy Officer at Walgreens, co-chaired by John Colaizzi Jr., PharmD, FNJPhA, Vice President, Pharmacy Practice at Walgreens and Angela Kashuba, Dean, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, and Lorri Walmsley, Director, Walgreens Pharmacy Affairs, who will serve as the vice chair.\n\nPharmacists have been a cornerstone of healthcare in communities across the United States for decades, providing timely interventions and filling gaps in care. While the demand for pharmacy services is expected to increase over the next several years, like many other healthcare entities and a wide range of other industries, pharmacy is facing a pronounced labor shortage.1 Pharmacy school applications were down 22% in 2022-2023 compared to the previous year and have decreased by more than 60% over the past decade.2,3 The pharmacy operating model needs to evolve, and pharmacy school deans are critical partners in helping Walgreens and the industry overall solve for the current workplace challenges that are also impacting pharmacy school enrollment.\n\n\"Collaboration within the pharmacy profession has never been more important, and I'm grateful to the many academic leaders who have joined the Deans Advisory Council as we work to transform the future of pharmacy,\" said Gates. \"I look forward to working with the deans to ensure Walgreens expands our reach beyond neighborhood pharmacies into the fast-growing areas of healthcare and drives outcomes that matter most to our pharmacists, patients and partners.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMembers of the Council will meet quarterly with the goal of identifying ways to attract, recruit and create a dynamic workplace for current and future pharmacists. The Council's initial objectives include:\n\nRebuilding the talent pipeline and focusing on recruitment efforts, including through programs that expose high school students to careers in pharmacy. Elevating community pharmacy as a practice setting of choice through direct feedback from colleges. Addressing staffing challenges and helping pharmacists experience greater job satisfaction and better patient interactions. Evolving the community pharmacy business model and advocating for pharmacist practitioner services. Advising on all aspects of community pharmacy strategy, practice and administration-related topics.\n\n\"As the recent pandemic highlighted, pharmacists are the most accessible, trusted healthcare providers. They serve as the front door to health in their communities, yet community pharmacy remains one of healthcare's most underutilized resources,\" said Kashuba. \"Our schools train pharmacists to fill healthcare gaps and improve patient care through disease screening, prevention and treatment. I'm excited to collaborate with Walgreens to better align workplace conditions with training to transform the future of community pharmacy.\"\n\nThe Council will serve as a sounding board and play a key role in helping Walgreens build upon recent initiatives deployed by the company to reimagine the community pharmacy operating model. These include; leveraging centralized services and micro-fulfillment, deploying flexible store and staffing models and eliminating all task-based retail metrics from annual performance reviews.\n\nThe Council's first meeting is scheduled for early March 2024.\n\nAbout Walgreens\n\nWalgreens (www.walgreens.com) is included in the United States segment of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

        "title": "CVS chief medical officer: 'We are not looking to build the entire healthcare delivery ecosystem'",
        "content": "The role of retail players in healthcare, like CVS (CVS), Walmart (WMT) and now Amazon (AMZN), is being closely watched by investors and clinicians alike.\n\nIn its latest earnings, CVS emphasized a continued strategy in health services, even as competitor Walgreens (WBA) has signaled a pullback. Through its recent acquisitions of home health provider Signify, and primary care provider for seniors Oak Street, CVS is continuing to look for ways to create a closed loop for patients within its own system.\n\n\"Oak Street ended the year with 202,000 at risk lives an increase of 27% versus the prior year. Through January, the number of Aetna members enrolled in Oak Street Clinic has doubled,\" said CEO Karen Lynch on the recent earnings call.\n\n\"Signify completed 649,000 in-home evaluations in the quarter, an increase of 20% versus the same period last year. Among our Aetna customers, we are broadening our addressable market utilizing Signify's strong capabilities in other products, including individual exchange and Medicaid,\" Lynch said.\n\nChief medical officer Sree Chaguturu told Yahoo Finance the company is \"building a world of health around every consumer.\"\n\n\"We are not looking to build the entire health care delivery ecosystem. But where we are choosing to build is where we believe there's the greatest opportunity to improve health outcomes. That's primary care, retail health, home services and physician enablement and accountable care \u2014 and that's helping physicians participate in value-based care,\" Chaguturu said in a recent, wide-ranging interview.\n\nWhen asked if those services step on the toes of legacy providers, like hospital systems and physician groups, by taking market share away from less complex cases, Chaguturu said it was the opposite.\n\n\"These are the most complex patients in our healthcare ecosystem, with multiple chronic diseases, and in addition to the chronic illnesses, many aspects of social fragility and social determinants of need,\" he said.\n\nStory continues (Getty Images) (Hispanolistic via Getty Images)\n\nGrowth amid downward pressure\n\nThe company's recent earnings beat Wall Street expectations, reporting $93.8 billion in revenue for 2023, compared to an expected $90.7 billion. But it cut its 2024 outlook, expecting an expensive year ahead.\n\nThat includes increased utilization costs for Aetna Medicare Advantage patients as delayed services from the pandemic continue to come back, and pharmacy benefits managers, like CVS Caremark, becoming a target for lawmakers in Congress who are looking at ways to reduce the power of such \"middlemen.\" Typically, such middlemen are blamed for increased costs in the health ecosystem, but Chaguturu says they will help in the rush of use of weight loss drugs.\n\nThe frenzy over GLP-1s, drugs that have been used for diabetics to help increase insulin production and help slow digestion, have been approved in the past few years for weight loss in obese patients.\n\nThough GLP-1s, named for the hormone in the body they mimic, are not new, the latest formulations have had record weight loss results. That has spurred a rush of interest ranging from patients to online health platforms looking to take advantage of the trend by offering prescriptions.\n\nStill, according to CVS, 80% of the prescriptions for the four top-selling drugs, from Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) are for Type 2 diabetes patients.\n\nChaguturu said the PBMs will continue to drive down pricing to ensure access for more patients, and expects that more competition \u2014 which could begin as early as the end of this year \u2014 will also help drive down costs. CVS benefits by earning fees on the prescriptions of the drug it fills, as well as the rebates it gains from the drug manufacturers for covering the drugs and providing access to patients.\n\nBut it isn't an unfettered gold rush. CVS is working with hesitant customers, like insurers and employers, who worry about the increased costs. The roughly $1,000-per-month GLP-1 drugs have caused some employers and insurers to stop covering them, or to require prior authorization in order to fill the prescription.\n\nThat includes CVS's own insurer, Aetna, which told Yahoo Finance previously that, \"Prior authorization is required for coverage of these medications. This process allows our clinicians to review the request using evidence-based guidelines to ensure that coverage is appropriate given the member\u2019s clinical status. The prior authorization process may include a review of the member\u2019s age, body mass index, previous medical history and response to previous therapy.\"\n\nCVS is also building clinical support for the employers and insurers, to ensure patients who get prescriptions actually need them, and then providing support to manage any side effects, according to Chaguturu.\n\nHe said clients are taking a variety of approaches to GLP-1s, including waiting until prices come down, or until a way to ensure appropriate prescribing is in place, before agreeing to cover them.\n\n\"In addition to bringing down pricing, we offer coverage and clinical solutions to help employers and health plans have access,\" he said.\n\nHe expects new competitors on the scene, driving the ability to bring down pricing per prescription and net cost of prescription over the coming years.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

You will then hear an automated message. Advising you your hand is raised your question, please press star one one. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Matt Partridge, Chief Financial. Please go.\n\nMatthew Partridge\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for the Alpine Income Property Trust Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 operating results conference call. With me today is our CEO and President, John Albright. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of our comments today are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in these forward-looking statements, and we undertake no duty to update these statements. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are disclosed from time to time in greater detail in the Company's Form 10 K Form 10 Q and other SEC filings. You can find our SEC reports, earnings release and most recent investor presentation, which contain reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures we use on our website at Alpine ri.com. I'll now turn the call over to John for his prepared remarks.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohn Albright\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As we look back at our execution in 2023, we continued to emphasize the value focus, asset recycling program we implemented nearly two years ago. This program has allowed us to reposition our portfolio into higher quality credits that derisk our cash flows and provided the liquidity needed for our opportunistic share repurchases and strong yielding first mortgage investments. Within the fourth quarter, the majority of our investment activity was concentrated in the first mortgage investments in share repurchases, and we believe these investment opportunities provide attractive risk-adjusted returns compared to other opportunities available in the market.\r\nDuring the quarter, we originated nearly $31 million of first mortgage loan investments and acquired two single tenant net lease properties for $3 million. The initial yield on our loan investments was 9.2%, and the cash cap rate of our property acquisitions was 7.3%, our largest investment with a low leverage $24 million first mortgage secured by 41 retail properties. In conjunction with a loan we entered into a fee sharing agreement with CTO Realty Growth, our external manager. This fee sharing agreement allows us to receive a share of the asset management disposition and leasing fees related to CTO.'s management.\r\nThe other loan investments we made during the quarter were the first mortgage to provide $6.8 million in funding towards the purchase and development of a five acre project anchored by Wal-Mart and McDonald's in a growing submarket of Nashville, Tennessee. While we intend for our loan investments to remain a relatively small component of our overall asset base and strategy. They do provide future purchase options for our acquisition pipeline and serve as a catalyst for our future partnership opportunities with the sponsors, and we believe they offer compelling risk-adjusted yields supported by strong tenant credits and well-capitalized sponsors.\r\nOn the acquisition front, we acquired two newly built properties leased to Dollar Tree Family Dollar as we saw fewer attractive core investment opportunities due to reluctant sellers.\r\nAnd finally, as it relates to our common stock buybacks, we repurchased $9.5 million of our common stock at an average price of just over $16 per share during the fourth quarter. The implied cap rate of these repurchases was above 8%, which is significantly above the cap rates for comparable fee-simple property investments available in that market, especially considering 65% of our annualized base rent comes from tenants with an investment grade credit rating in our stock pays nearly a 6.9% dividend yield at $16 per share.\r\nFor the full year 2023, we acquired 14 net lease properties for a $3 million and a 7.4% cash cap rate in originated first mortgage investments totaling just under $39 million of funding commitments at the initial yield of 9.1% over 66% of the acquired base rents from the property acquisitions in 2023 come from Tenet with investment grade credit rating on the disposition side of things during the full year 2023 we sold 24 properties for $108 million at a weighted average exit cap rate of 6.3%, generating gains of $9.3 million. Overall for the year, our net investment spread, which is different between our investment yields and disposition yields, averaged 159 basis points. So even with limited access to the capital markets and the increase in interest rates over the past 18 months, we're still driving positive increases in cash flow through our asset recycling strategy.\r\nFrom our portfolio makeup perspective, Matt, will outline more of the specifics with his prepared remarks. But given we are coming up on our five year anniversary later this year, I wanted to take a moment to highlight the progress we've made in transitioning our portfolio through our asset recycling strategy. Since inception of the Company, we've recycled nearly $600 million of capital as we've accretively sold off primarily office assets and properties occupied not by non credit tenants and reinvested the proceeds at positive net investment spreads. As a result, we've taken our office exposure from 43% to 0%. Increase. Our exposure to investment grade rated tenants from 36% to 65%, increased per-share quarterly dividend by more than 37%. And our top tenant list, which includes the likes of the industry leaders such as Walgreens, Lowe's, Dick's Sporting, good Dollar Tree, Family, dollar dollar, general Walmart, Best Buy Hobby Lobby in Home Depot now compared favorably to many of our peers that trade at significantly better valuations. From a valuation perspective, we're currently trading well above an implied 8% cap rate on our real estate portfolio. At a significant discount to our book value of $18.36 per share. Additionally, we have strong AFFO per share growth projected for 2024 in our low and that loan investments provide a natural deleveraging opportunity over the next 24 months. To put it bluntly, we're a great value today, and we look forward to maximizing that value for our shareholders.\r\nNow I'll turn the call over to Matt to discuss our portfolio makeup, quarterly results, balance sheet and 2024 guidance section.\n\nMatthew Partridge\n\nAs of the end of the year, our portfolio consisted of 138 properties totaling 3.8 million square feet with tenants operating in 23 sectors within 35 states. And as John mentioned 65% of our annualized base rent or ABR now comes from tenants are the parent of tenants who have an investment grade credit rating. The portfolio continues to be 99% occupied and our top tenants remain largely unchanged. However, we do anticipate occupancy increasing over the coming months as we have signed or in the process of signing multiple leases related to the vacant properties. Fourth quarter 2023 FFO was $0.37 per share, unchanged when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. In Q4 2023, AFFO was $0.38 per share, representing a 7.3% decrease over the fourth quarter of 2022. Our quarterly results were most notably impacted by one-time expenses related to tenant credit loss and bankruptcy, primarily attributable to the seven Valero branded Mountain Express properties that we discussed during our third quarter conference call, as well as the timing of investments and dispositions. These items were partially offset by regular rent increases within the owned portfolio, attractive net investment spreads from asset recycling program, increased interest income from cash and restricted cash on balance sheet and lower interest expense driven by year-over-year effects of previously completed interest rate hedges.\r\nOur general and administrative expenses for the quarter totaled $1.5 million which includes the $1.1 million management fee to our external manager. Our G&A increased 4.5% year over year, largely a result of higher state and local taxes and increases to the management fee driven by our net equity capital markets activities over the past 12 months. The current annual run rate for our management fee before any assumed new equity issuances or repurchases is $4.2 million.\r\nFor the full year, FFO was $1.47 per share and AFFO was $1.49 per share representing year over year per share decreases of 15% and 16% respectively, when compared to the full year of 2022. As previously announced, the Company paid a fourth quarter cash dividend of $27.5 per share, representing a current annualized yield of more than 7%. And our fourth quarter FFO and AFFO payout ratios remained fairly consistent at 74%, 72%, respectively. We anticipate announcing our regular quarterly cash common stock dividend for the first quarter of 2024 towards the end of February from an equity capital markets perspective, we continue to be active during the quarter on our Board approved a $15 million share repurchase program, repurchasing nearly 595,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost of $9.5 million at an average price of $16.1 per share. In 2023, we repurchased nearly 900,000 shares of our common stock for total costs for a total cost of $14.6 million at an average price of $16.23 per share and in January, we did complete the remainder of the $15 million share repurchase program. We ended the quarter with net debt to total enterprise value of 51%. Net debt to pro forma EBITDA of 7.7 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio was a healthy 3.5 times the balance sheet as well stabilized with no debt maturities until 2026 and total liquidity at quarter end through cash, restricted cash and undrawn revolver commitments was more than $187 million. And our press release last night. Initial guidance for 2024 reflects our confidence in the portfolio's quality. The year-over-year benefits from the asset recycling John referenced increased fee revenue from our fee sharing agreement with CTO. and what we believe is a reasonably cautious stance regarding our current access to capital expected activity in the transactions market and broader economic environment.\r\nAs we begin 2024 with portfolio-wide in-place annualized straight-line base rent and in-place annualized cash base rent of $38.8 million and a run rate annualized interest income from loan investments of $3.2 million. Our full year 2024 FFO guidance range is $1.51 to $1.56 per share, and our full year 2024 FFO guidance range is $1.53 to $1.58 per share for 2024. Guidance for investment activity is $50 million to $80 million of investments contingent on reasonable market conditions, and our investments guidance does include the potential for additional loan investments.\r\nOur 2024 dispositions guidance is to sell between $50 million to $80 million properties. And we are currently assuming approximately 75 basis points to 100 basis points net investment spread between our investment yields and our disposition yields.\r\nAnd finally, we are forecasting our weighted average share count for 2024 to be approximately 14.9 million shares. And this does incorporate the effects of the of completing the remaining portion of the $15 million share repurchase program I referenced earlier. We appreciate everyone joining the call today, and we'll now open it up for questions.\r\nOperator?\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name. To Be Your question, please press star one when again one moment.\r\nWell, CROSSTALK, our first question is going to come from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Stevenson\n\nGood morning, guys. Matt, just to follow up on one of your latter comment is the $0.05 guidance range. Is that just acquisition and dispositions that slide between there? Is there something else notable that would push you down to the $1.51 or up to the $1.56 or conversely the AFFO range?\n\nMatthew Partridge\n\nYes, morning, Rob. Part of it is the acquisition and disposition timing and then the other component that could move that around a little bit is whether or not we get loan repayments specifically for the $24 million loan where that is intended to be a liquidated portfolio. And so that could cause interest income to be reduced over the period of the year.\n\nRobert Stevenson\n\nOkay. And what is the latest in terms of the Mountain Express stuff is that going to wind up being some of the sales this year? Is that all going to be retenanted some of it? How are you guys looking at that at this point?\n\nMatthew Partridge\n\nYes. So we're in active discussions with a number of operators. We've got two leases signed on two of the locations. We're working on three more, and then we're in preliminary discussions on the other two, we're still anticipating selling them just given our focus on publicly traded or publicly rated tenants. But Tom, we're in active discussions to have all of that at least in the near to medium term.\n\nRobert Stevenson\n\nOkay. And come when you take when you guys take a look at the portfolio, how much of it is likely disposition candidates at this point versus, you know, only if you found something that was an extremely compelling buy? I mean, are you pretty much done with the recycling of the majority of the assets unless somebody comes and it makes a very strong offers are still, you know, the bottom 25% of the portfolio's likely to be sold, you know, going forward, how are you guys thinking about where this portfolio is versus where you'd wanted if you started with a clean sheet of paper?\n\nJohn Albright\n\nYes, I think it's a little bit of a barbell and we still have some really low cap rate property that we may decide to monetize and recycle into higher cap rates. And then o always continuing to upgrade the portfolio as a whole by selling off the bottom part of the portfolio like the Mountain Express. So we'll we'll work to basically continue to upgrade the portfolio even stronger. But so we have two levers there on the bottom and some of the super high quality.\n\nRobert Stevenson\n\nOkay. And then how are you guys thinking, you know, obviously grow given your size, adding even one new tenant or one new industry moves the needle for you guys still. But how are you guys thinking about tenant and industry concentrations going forward? And I'm, you know, is that I think a lot of people ask questions about Walgreens at 12% and dollar stores, which we just added a couple of them quarter at 14%. Do you keep acquiring Dollar Stores is that not, you know, can you would you take that up to 20% and Walgreens? Is that a disposition candidate at some point to lower that down below 12% exposure how are you guys thinking about? That's sort of constantly\n\nJohn Albright\n\nSo good question. So we're definitely going to look to lower the Walgreens exposure over time. We're not in a mad rush, but also hunting for more Walmart's low is that not at home, but the Home Depots and upgrading the portfolio there and getting those credits higher up on the list. But it's just like it's difficult to find the right ones, but we'll continue to pursue them and in upgrading the portfolio that way.\n\nRobert Stevenson\n\nAnd then what about dollar stores? What's your appetite to continue taking that up?\n\nJohn Albright\n\nYes, we're not going to I don't think you'll see us active on a dollar store acquisitions on Boca.\n\nRobert Stevenson\n\nAnd then just Doug, a couple of data ones. What were the two assets that you guys sold during the quarter?\n\nMatthew Partridge\n\nYes, one was a convenience store branded as a BP and the other one was a two tenant property it was a bond guards which used to be as for our I'm sorry, is the bond ours, which is similar to a Tractor Supply. And then a I'm looking now at the BP. I'm drawing a blank on the other one are up, sorry, but it is de minimus piece of the of the overall puzzle.\n\nRobert Stevenson\n\nOkay. And then last one for me. Data-wise, it did the Board reauthorized a new share repurchase plan. And if so, what was the size?\n\nJohn Albright\n\nWe would basically have that in our announcement if they had. So we'll monitor kind of what goes on there and the kind of reflect if things change.\n\nRobert Stevenson\n\nOkay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time. Have a good weekend.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Robbie, to you in one moment, as we move on to our question.\r\nNext question is going to come from the line of Westleigh Golladay with Baird, your line of.\n\nWesley Golladay\n\nYes, hey, good morning, guys. Just a question on the investment guidance, does that include the buybacks and at $15 a share? Would buybacks be the top priority for use capital?\n\nMatthew Partridge\n\nSo good question West morning. It does not include any buyback activity that would be in addition to the investment guidance. And I mean at $15 a share, we're obviously well over 8%, 8% implied cap rate.\r\nSo I think that's certainly something that we'll have a discussion with the Board about in terms of potential new program beginning\n\nWesley Golladay\n\nand then know that you talked about no signing some leases and just kind of curious, would you have in guidance for assume rent from the leasing of the property?\n\nMatthew Partridge\n\nWe have the two that we've signed so far and that's it.\n\nWesley Golladay\n\nOkay. I guess we'll get kind of for to build the model and to build dispositions at our model. I guess what are the total upside in rent? Obviously you're going to sell them, but we need to put it, get it in the model and then exit the monetizing assets. So how much, I guess from the current run rate, how much upside do you have into rent from releasing the asset?\n\nMatthew Partridge\n\nYes. So the current run rate includes the two wheeler side, I would say for now assume nothing. And then obviously, as this does come to fruition. We'll report them right where we're call it two months away from from doing this again. And so we'll provide another update and update the numbers then.\n\nWesley Golladay\n\nOkay. And then last one for me. What do you have for assume leverage throughout the year? And how does that impact your borrowing base based looking at the spreads?\n\nMatthew Partridge\n\nYes. So we're assuming there's some slight delevering. We'll based on sort of the forecast and guidance, we should end the year closer to 7 times net debt to EBITDA, which should benefit the interest rate spread going into 2025.\n\nWesley Golladay\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And one moment as we move on to our next. Yes. Our next question is going to come from the line of Matthew Gardener with Jones Trading. Your line is open. Please go.\n\nMatthew Erdner\n\nHey, guys, good morning and thanks for taking the question. So the loans look like they provide some pretty solid risk-adjusted returns. Are you seeing these more than acquisitions, dispositions at the moment? And if so, is there a certain amount of capital that you guys would be comfortable allocating to the strategy and I know that that you don't want to do this kind of off the bat. But yes, I guess what would you be comfortable getting up to for this two year period.\n\nJohn Albright\n\nI mean, I think you're seeing us on the top level of kind of where we want to be on the loans. So you what you'll see is really loans either paying down or selling off pieces of loan too, to do new loans. So I don't think you're going to see the portfolio of loans get any larger.\n\nMatthew Erdner\n\nGot you. Thank you. And then in terms of the transaction market, what do you think you need to see for it to kind of really get going again? Is that, you know, Fed rate cuts are kind of money coming off of the sidelines. You note, what are you guys thinking there?\n\nJohn Albright\n\nSo I think you're starting to see are we're starting to see a little bit more activity now, I think people have been hanging on for a rate cut and the higher interest costs as debt rolling over is starting to bite a little bit more and so people are just kind of making harder decisions now about selling assets that there don't really want to sell, but it makes a lot of sense given given the high debt costs and so forth. So I'm pretty much a feel of the optimistic camp that as rates seem to and the further out as far as rate cuts, you're seeing more activity on that transaction market.\n\nMatthew Erdner\n\nAwesome. Thanks for taking the questions. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of R.J. Milligan with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nRJ Milligan\n\nGood morning, guys. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I'm just curious on John, on Walgreens, I think it's a split rated in terms of credit rating. Just can you talk about how you feel about that specific credit and maybe exposure to pharmacies in general, given what we've been seeing the industry.\n\nJohn Albright\n\nYes. I mean, look, clearly, either their company and the headlines of the properties we have are very good locations. And obviously with new management at Walgreens and pay the dividend and selling off in some divisions, you know, they're going to become a healthier credit, obviously. And so the good news is our locations even if you found another tenant, there's a lot of tenant demand out there for locations. I was with the developer two days ago, who is a prolific developer of all kinds of various retailers and you can't build a box for less than $300, $30 these days. So so you're going to see tenants being very active in taking over other tenant spaces. So I think the backdrop is that, yes, there's a lot of tenant demand out there if you had some issues with particular boxes. So it's all about basis. And I think, you know, with our basis trading at $127 a square foot along the the whole portfolio, we got a lot of room there. So we're not we're not kind of having sleepless nights or Walgreens, but we will be, you know, pruning the exposure for sure.\n\nRJ Milligan\n\nGreat. Thanks. That's it for me.\n\nJohn Albright\n\nGreat. Thanks, RJ.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question.\r\nOur next question comes from the line of Anthony Howe with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Please go.\n\nAnthony Hau\n\nGood morning, guys. And thanks for your question. So in 2023, you guys are doing all the right things, right, completing numerous initiatives to close the valuation gap for the market. Now rewarding for those actions like So what other levers can you pull to close that gap this year while reducing leverage? And how do you balance between leverage buying back stock and growing that equity float?\n\nJohn Albright\n\nYes. I mean, look, if the stock continues to trade at these massive discount to NAV and high implied cap rates and high dividend yield, clearly, we'll look to buy more stock because we're going to be accreting NAV and really giving shareholders a strong total return of basically a synopsis. And so if you look at kind of where we're trading versus the comps, which you know it better than we do. You know what we're trying to kind of give a value proposition to shareholder to say why would you take a higher basis risk and lower implied cap rate when you could have the same exposure to IG at much higher cap rate, lower valuation, higher dividend yield. So the value proposition is there. We'll be trying our best to communicate it, but the market has not taken it and then we'll look to buy back more shares and sell down assets to keep the leverage neutral. So it's pretty easy. It's not are not rocket science. We've been through this many times, and I feel like we have good opportunities out there. And so on so we'll DiskOnKey and working through.\n\nAnthony Hau\n\nIt sounds like that's like attached to it, right? Because I think one of the main reasons why investors are not wanting those actions because the liquidity of the stock is free is pretty limited, right, compared to your other triple net. So how do you balance between like buying back stock and like keeping that liquidity for investors?\n\nJohn Albright\n\nYes. I mean, we can't we can't really, you know, we can't basically give investors everything. I mean, investors obviously want everything. But look, we're able to buy what almost 1 million shares with our buyback. And as you know, the buyback programs are very problematic. And then we have we can't we can't basically buy back at certain times of days. We can't buy back with certain percentage of volume in the shares are trading and we certainly are price sensitive. So even with all those parameters, we're able to buy a million shares relatively easy. So investors can buy the share. They just basically just they would probably have a hard fast rule that, hey, if we are trading below a certain amount of shares per day. We can't touch you kind of thing. So but you can buy the shares. And I think we've demonstrated that. So it for more of the value investors seem to seem to kind of latch on which show you a more long term holding sort of investors seem to understand the value proposition.\n\nRJ Milligan\n\nThank you.\n\nJohn Albright\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And one moment as we move on to our next Quest.\r\nAnd our next question comes from the line of John Massocca, B. Riley. Your line is open, please.\n\nCraig Kucera\n\nGood morning. Morning, Dan. So quick question on the disposition guidance. I mean, should we assume that some repayment of some of these mortgage investments is in that guidance today? And maybe just kind of roughly what are you kind of expecting to get repaid from this year?\n\nMatthew Partridge\n\nYes, good question, John morning. There's a limited amount of repayment related to the $24 million loan that we originated in the fourth quarter, starting really in the third quarter, but we're talking call it 10% over the balance of the back half of 2024. So not a meaningful amount. We think that will probably ramp up when we get into 2025 and hopefully into a different interest-rate environment in a more efficient transaction environment.\n\nCraig Kucera\n\nThat's and I can tell you what are some of the variables out in the external world that could change that and the view or can cause that to be different than guidance? I mean, essentially as we think about kind of an uncertain rate world, does that impact that or is it all just based on execution in terms of selling down the assets in that collateral pool?\n\nMatthew Partridge\n\nYes, I think it's both. I mean for that specific collateral pool, I think it's a more active transaction environment with pricing that the borrower deems to be appropriate. But then on the other two loans. Those are the reserve development loans where once the tenant gets open and operating, I think it's either a refinancing opportunity from the borrower. So obviously, the interest rate environment would have an influence on that, or it's again, a more efficient transaction market where they feel like they can sell it at the appropriate price.\n\nCraig Kucera\n\nAnd then maybe bigger picture on on kind of guidance that the investments and dispositions at the midpoint, obviously kind of balance each other out. Is there any expectation in your mind of the difference in timing between deploying capital and kind of your capital recycling over the course of the year?\n\nMatthew Partridge\n\nI mean, certainly there will be we're assuming that all sort of balances itself out over the years. Sometimes we sell ahead of buying and sometimes we buy ahead of selling. But guidance assumes it's a relatively balanced approach.\n\nCraig Kucera\n\nAgain, the balance sheet, no debt and the revolvers a little bit over the amount you have swapped, but it kind of seems like it matches the the amount and the loan pool, or is it kind of fair to assume that's free floating at least over the intermediate term?\n\nMatthew Partridge\n\nYes, I think you're going to assume that that's going to flow and that as these loans get repaid will allow, we'll evaluate what the redeployment options are in the market and that evaluation will include potentially paying down that floating rate guess.\n\nCraig Kucera\n\nThat's it for me. Thank you very much, Sasha.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\r\nThis concludes today's question and answer session. This also concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. TJX (TJX) earns a Zacks Rank #3 19 days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 28, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.12 a share.\n\nTJX's Earnings ESP sits at 0.54%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.12 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11.\n\nTJX is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on March 26, 2024. WBA's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.85 a share 46 days from its next earnings release.\n\nFor Walgreens Boots Alliance, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.85 is 0.64%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTJX and WBA's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "content": "(Reuters) - U.S. drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance on Wednesday said it has cut its stake in pharmaceutical distributor Cencora for the third time in just over six months, pocketing about $992 million.\n\nThe proceeds include around $942 million from shares sold as well as about $50 million from a concurrent share repurchase by Cencora, formerly AmerisourceBergen.\n\nWalgreens has been grappling with waning demand for COVID-19 vaccines and testing as well as decreased spending on personal care and beauty products by inflation-weary consumers.\n\nIt said it now owns around 13% of Cencora's common stock from 15% previously, and that it would use the sale proceeds primarily to pay down debt.\n\nThe sale will have no impact on their long-term partnership and Walgreens' chief operating officer, international, Ornella Barra, will continue to serve on Cencora's board of directors, Walgreens said.\n\nWalgreens sold Cencora shares worth about $674 million in November 2023 and earned about $1.85 billion from a sale in August.\n\nCencora changed its name from AmerisourceBergen in the second half of 2023 as part of efforts to expand internationally beyond drug distribution.\n\n(Reporting by Pratik Jain in Bengaluru; Editing by Christopher Cushing)",

        "content": "Stocks such as Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) have been among the worst performers. And while investors should steer clear of those stinkers, there are a few blue-chip names worth buying on the dip. Here are seven Dow stocks to buy on the dip: February 2024.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the lead-up to its recent fourth-quarter earnings, Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell from a 52-week high. Its market cap dropped below $3 trillion. And it lost the title of the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Unfortunately, Apple slipped even more after the Q4 results showed a 13% decline in iPhone sales across China. The good news is much of the hand-wringing is overdone, and there are still good reasons to buy Apple shares.\n\nWhile it is true that sales of Apple\u2019s electronic devices such as its iPhone, iPad, and MacBook computer have slowed, the services side of the company has more than made up for any shortfall. In addition, Apple still beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations on the top and bottom lines with its Q4 print. Revenue rose in the quarter, breaking a streak of four consecutive quarters of declines.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple is one of the top Dow stocks to buy before it resumes its growth trajectory.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nAnother one of the top Dow stocks to buy on dips is McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD). After the quick-service restaurant chain reported mixed financial results, the stock slipped. However, McDonald\u2019s fourth-quarter results were strong. For example, MCD reported fourth-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $2.95, which topped Wall Street estimates of $2.82. Sales increased 8% year over year, with total revenue coming in at $6.41 billion, which was a little less than the $6.45 billion forecast by analysts.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s blamed the revenue miss on the escalating conflict in the Middle East, which has hurt its global sales. Outside the Middle East, all other global markets, including China, reported positive same-store sales growth. Domestic same-store sales at McDonald\u2019s rose 4.3%, in line with Wall Street forecasts. MCD stock is down 4% on the year and ripe for the picking.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext up on this list of top Dow stocks to buy is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While the tech giant\u2019s results managed to beat expectations on Wall Street, they didn\u2019t blow away estimates. Plus, there was very little mention of artificial intelligence (AI) to be found in its report. This appears to have left investors feeling underwhelmed, which led to a pullback in the MSFT stock. However, investors should buy the dip.\n\nWhile Microsoft is only now starting to monetize AI, the company continues to demonstrate strong growth in its cloud-computing unit, with revenue from its Intelligent Cloud segment rising 20% from a year earlier to $25.88 billion. During Q4 2023, Microsoft closed its $68 billion acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, its largest deal ever. The company has also announced custom cloud microchips and started selling a $30 monthly Copilot AI add-on with its software bundles.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with \"diesel\" and \"food mart\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nU.S. oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has seen its stock fall 10% over the last 12 months as earnings have been eroded by a decline in crude prices. After posting record profits in 2022 when crude oil was trading above $100 a barrel, Chevron has had to contend with a steady decline over the last year. However, there are still reasons to buy CVX stock. These include a dividend payment that the company just increased by 8%, taking the yield on the stock to 4.28%.\n\nChevron now pays out a strong quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share. Despite its profit in 2023 declining by 40%, the company still returned a record $23.60 billion to shareholders by paying out $11.30 billion in dividends and buying back $14.90 billion of its own stock. And although crude oil is currently trading around $73.50 per barrel, Chevron still managed to produce a record 3.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day last year as the company boosted its capital expenditures.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chase Bank logo and storefront\n\nSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile it hasn\u2019t been immune to the bank stock downturn, shares of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) have fared better than most of its peers. Over the past year, JPM stock has gained 23%, including a 2% increase so far in 2024. The world\u2019s biggest lender with $4 trillion of assets under management has proven to be more immune to high-interest rates than smaller banks.\n\nWhile JPMorgan reported mixed Q4 2023 financial results, the print was due to a $3 billion fee it was forced to pay related to the government\u2019s seizure of failed regional lenders. However, despite the fee it paid to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, JPMorgan is still viewed as having come out of last year\u2019s regional banking crisis as a winner. It acquired First Republic, a midsized lender to wealthy families, amid the collapse of several regional lenders across the U.S. First Republic is already having a positive impact on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings, according to the bank.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nSneaker giant Nike (NYSE:NKE) has been one of the worst-performing Dow components over the last few years. Over the last year, for example, the stock plummeted about 20%. Not helping, its share price plunged 12% in a single day in December after its sales guidance for 2024 was lowered. The good news is that Nike\u2019s stock looks to have bottomed right around $100 per share. Each time the share price dips below that level, it quickly regains its footing.\n\nPatient investors who take a position in NKE stock now are likely to be rewarded with future gains coming off the current bottom. And while Nike\u2019s most recent earnings print was mixed, it contained some encouraging data. For example, the company\u2019s gross margin rose for the first time in 18 months and reached 44.6%; inventories declined 14%; and sales in China, an important market for the company, rose 10.1%, which was the fastest pace of growth since May 2023.\n\nIt will likely take time to recover, but Nike is a Dow stock to buy on the dip.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Visa (NYSE:V) has been volatile, investors might want to buy one of the dips. After all, the company just reported Q4 2023 financial results that beat analysts\u2019 forecasts across the board. It also issued upbeat guidance as consumer spending remains resilient in the face of inflation and high-interest rates. It also posted EPS of $2.41, which topped Wall Street estimates of $2.34.\n\nRevenue in Q4 2023 totaled $8.60 billion, up 9% from a year earlier and ahead of forecasts that called for $8.50 billion in sales.\n\nLooking ahead, Visa said that it expects revenue growth in the current first quarter of 2024 in the \u201cupper-mid to high-single digits\u201d and profit growth in the \u201chigh-teens.\u201d Visa said its payment volumes, which cover the year-end holiday shopping season, rose 8% in Q4 2023, while cross-border volumes increased 16%. The company\u2019s total transactions in Q4 rose nearly 10% to $57.50 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in AAPL and MSFT.

        "content": "The Walgreens Deans Advisory Council will collaborate to address key issues, including staffing challenges and decreasing pharmacy school enrollment\n\nDEERFIELD, Ill., February 05, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As a trusted, convenient local healthcare destination that millions of Americans rely on every day, Walgreens is expanding its long-standing relationships with colleges of pharmacy through the formation of the Walgreens Deans Advisory Council to enhance the pharmacy profession and better support pharmacists as they provide valuable care to their local communities.\n\nThe new Council, consisting of 17 pharmacy school deans and Walgreens leadership, is sponsored by Rick Gates, Chief Pharmacy Officer at Walgreens, co-chaired by John Colaizzi Jr., PharmD, FNJPhA, Vice President, Pharmacy Practice at Walgreens and Angela Kashuba, Dean, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, and Lorri Walmsley, Director, Walgreens Pharmacy Affairs, who will serve as the vice chair.\n\nPharmacists have been a cornerstone of healthcare in communities across the United States for decades, providing timely interventions and filling gaps in care. While the demand for pharmacy services is expected to increase over the next several years, like many other healthcare entities and a wide range of other industries, pharmacy is facing a pronounced labor shortage.1 Pharmacy school applications were down 22% in 2022-2023 compared to the previous year and have decreased by more than 60% over the past decade.2,3 The pharmacy operating model needs to evolve, and pharmacy school deans are critical partners in helping Walgreens and the industry overall solve for the current workplace challenges that are also impacting pharmacy school enrollment.\n\n\"Collaboration within the pharmacy profession has never been more important, and I\u2019m grateful to the many academic leaders who have joined the Deans Advisory Council as we work to transform the future of pharmacy,\" said Gates. \"I look forward to working with the deans to ensure Walgreens expands our reach beyond neighborhood pharmacies into the fast-growing areas of healthcare and drives outcomes that matter most to our pharmacists, patients and partners.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMembers of the Council will meet quarterly with the goal of identifying ways to attract, recruit and create a dynamic workplace for current and future pharmacists. The Council\u2019s initial objectives include:\n\nRebuilding the talent pipeline and focusing on recruitment efforts, including through programs that expose high school students to careers in pharmacy. Elevating community pharmacy as a practice setting of choice through direct feedback from colleges. Addressing staffing challenges and helping pharmacists experience greater job satisfaction and better patient interactions. Evolving the community pharmacy business model and advocating for pharmacist practitioner services. Advising on all aspects of community pharmacy strategy, practice and administration-related topics.\n\n\"As the recent pandemic highlighted, pharmacists are the most accessible, trusted healthcare providers. They serve as the front door to health in their communities, yet community pharmacy remains one of healthcare\u2019s most underutilized resources,\" said Kashuba. \"Our schools train pharmacists to fill healthcare gaps and improve patient care through disease screening, prevention and treatment. I\u2019m excited to collaborate with Walgreens to better align workplace conditions with training to transform the future of community pharmacy.\"\n\nThe Council will serve as a sounding board and play a key role in helping Walgreens build upon recent initiatives deployed by the company to reimagine the community pharmacy operating model. These include: leveraging centralized services and micro-fulfillment, deploying flexible store and staffing models and eliminating all task-based retail metrics from annual performance reviews.\n\nThe Council\u2019s first meeting is scheduled for early March 2024.\n\nAbout Walgreens\n\nWalgreens (www.walgreens.com) is included in the United States segment of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.
