        "content": "Repligen Corporation RGEN reported second-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share of 33 cents, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company had recorded adjusted earnings of 53 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.\n\nTotal revenues were $154 million, down 3% year over year on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of acquisition revenues and currency exchange, revenues declined 5% year over year organically.\u00a0 Revenues were also in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nThe year-over-year decrease in total revenues can be attributed to the absence of COVID-related revenues and the expected decrease in revenues from protein franchisees.\n\nShares of Repligen have declined 10.7% so far this year against the industry\u2019s rise of 0.1%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQuarter in Detail\n\nProduct revenues were $154 million, down 3.2% from the year-ago period. Royalty and other revenues were $0.04 million, almost flat year over year.\n\nRepligen\u2019s base business revenues of $149.6 million declined 5% year over year, owing to the anticipated decline in revenues from the proteins business.\n\nThe company\u2019s base business can be categorized under four franchises \u2014 filtration, chromatography, protein and process analytics.\n\nRevenues from the chromatography business improved 10% on a sequential basis. RGEN believes that the franchisee is witnessing signs of recovery as orders keep gaining traction.\n\nThe filtration franchise\u2019s sales grew almost 10% year-over-year, excluding non-COVID filtration revenues, driven by the success of ATF Tangenx flat sheet cassettes and systems.\n\nRevenues in the protein franchise have been declining in recent quarters and the company believes that it will continue to be the same for the remainder of 2024. RGEN expects the protein franchise to deliver $67-$72 million in revenues in 2024.\n\nThough the analytics business had a slow start, RGEN believes that the business unit is picking up pace in generating revenues.\n\nRevenues from the company\u2019s new modalities business, which includes cell and gene therapy and mRNA, were up more than 5% year on year in the reported quarter.\n\nAdjusted gross margin was 49.6% in the second quarter, down 60 basis points year over year.\n\nAdjusted research and development expenses totaled approximately $10.2 million, up almost 5.1% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level.\n\nAdjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $50.5 million, up 24.1% year over year.\n\nAdjusted operating income totaled $15.6 million, down almost 47.1% from the prior year quarter.

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\r\n I would like now to turn the call over to your host, Sondra Newman, Head of Investor Relations for Repligen. Please go ahead.\n\nSondra Newman\n\nThank you, and welcome to our second quarter of 2024 report. On this call, we will cover business highlights and financial performance for the three- and six-month periods ending June 30, 2024, and we will provide financial guidance for the year 2024. Joining us on the call today are Repligen's current Chief Executive Officer, Tony Hunt; our Chief Commercial Officer, Olivier Loeillot; and our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Garland.\r\n As a reminder, the forward-looking statements that we make during this call, including those regarding our business goals and expectations for the financial performance of the company, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events or results to differ. Additional information concerning risks related to our business is included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our annual report on Form 10-K and other current reports on 8-K, including the report that we are filing today, and other filings that we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's comments reflect management's current views, which could change as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The company does not obligate or commit itself to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\r\n During this call, we are providing non-GAAP financial results and guidance, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are included in the press release that we issued this morning, which is posted to Repligen's website and on sec.gov. Adjusted non-GAAP figures in today's report include the following: base revenue and organic revenue; non-COVID and non-proteins revenue; cost of sales, gross profit, and gross margin; operating expenses, including R&D and SG&A; income from operations and operating margin; other income, pretax income, tax provision, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share as well as EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. These adjusted financial measures should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures but are intended to best reflect the performance of our ongoing operations.\r\n Now I'll turn the call over to Tony Hunt.\n\nStory continues\n\nTony Hunt\n\nThank you, Sondra, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Q2 earnings call. As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported on an improving quarter for both revenues and orders, with orders pacing 2% above revenues for the second quarter and 1% above revenues for the first half of the year. As outlined in our May earnings call, we were looking for continued momentum in Q2. And with the exception of seeing China demand decline further and the known headwinds in proteins and COVID, we had a really good quarter.\r\n We saw a positive Q2 and year-to-date sales and order performance in pharma and a healthy pickup in CDMO order activity. Sales and order momentum on consumables continued and we saw a bounce back in equipment orders, both sequentially and year-over-year. And finally, our momentum in the new modality space continued, with first half revenues and orders well above the same period in 2023.\r\n We are narrowing revenue guidance within our range with the expectation that we will finish 2024 between $620 million to $635 million, which lowers our midpoint by 1%. This is directly related to the demand drop off in China, where we saw a weak Q2, which is driving an additional $10 million decline versus our May call.\r\n We're also seeing increased headwinds coming from FX. But overall, we're really happy with the progress we are seeing, including the strategic direction being reinforced for proteins with the pending acquisition of Tantti Lab that we announced yesterday.\r\n So moving now to the big picture on the quarter and the first half of 2024. Pharma revenues in Q2 were up about 15% sequentially and 20% year-on-year. Pharma orders were also strong, up 5% sequentially and 40% year-on-year.\r\n For CDMOs, while Q2 sales were down as anticipated, orders, as noted earlier, came in strong, up by 20% plus both sequentially and year-over-year. Book-to-bill for CDMO was over 1.4 for the quarter and 1.1 for the first half of the year. This improvement was driven by an uptick in Tier 2 CDMO activity, which we view as an important turn for emerging biotech and the overall biologics market. We look forward to seeing how this plays out later in the year and into 2025.\r\n Consumables maintained their momentum in Q2, with revenues up double digit versus Q1. Orders in Q2 were up 30% versus prior year and in line with our Q1 orders. With consumable orders up 20% in the first half of the year, we are confident that destocking is finally behind us.\r\n Moving to capital equipment. Similar to CDMOs, equipment was light on revenue in the quarter. We did, however, see first half equipment sales up close to 10% versus the first half of 2023.\r\n More importantly, equipment orders showed a very nice rebound, up 20% versus the last quarter and about 15% year-to-date on relatively easy comps. Supporting our order strength in H1 is the early success of our RS systems product line, where we have seen important wins at strategic accounts in Q2, including first placements of our most recently launched RS 10 system.\r\n While the Q2 results are encouraging, there are still headwinds in this part of the market. However, we still expect capital equipment orders to pick up further in the second half as we have a very strong opportunity funnel that we expect to convert to orders.\r\n The new modality customer base delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth in Q2 versus the same quarter in 2023. New modality orders were up more than 40% year-over-year, delivering a Q2 book-to-bill of 1.1. First half of the year, revenues were up greater than 10%. And more importantly, orders were up greater than 20% in the same period. This reflects the momentum we are seeing in this market and the strong portfolio fit for this customer base.\r\n Our regions continue to perform well, with the exception of China. China orders and sales were down again in Q2, and our expectation is that China revenues will now command around $25 million in 2024 or about $10 million lower than we were anticipating at the time of our Q1 call. Jason will cover more in his finance section on regional dynamics.\r\n So in summary, total Q2 revenues decreased 3% year-over-year, but were up 4% if you exclude non-COVID and proteins headwinds. Sequentially, total Q2 revenues were up 2%.\r\n We continue to see some lumpiness on a franchise level from quarter-to-quarter. Sales through the first half of 2024 support our view that our franchises are recovering. Further validating this view is orders performance in the quarter and first half. Total orders in Q2 were up 20% year-over-year and up 30%, if we exclude proteins. Sequentially, orders were up 5%.\r\n Moving to our updated revenue guidance for 2024. As noted earlier, we are narrowing our guidance to a range of $620 million to $635 million, reflecting the incremental headwinds from China and foreign exchange. We are encouraged that our businesses are performing as expected and we achieved our revenue targets in the first half of the year.\r\n Orders held steady, supporting a first half book-to-bill of 1.01 and higher in important market areas like CDMOs and new modalities. Our opportunity funnel continues to strengthen as we move through the first half of the year. The funnel is up significantly versus the same period in 2023. Our healthy funnel was reflected in our orders performance for the quarter and is another lens to support our view that the markets are more fully recovering as we move into the second half of 2024.\r\n With the positive uptick in orders and funnel strength, along with improving visibility, we expect the second half of the year revenue to be stronger versus first half. We also expect to see a return to robust revenue growth in the second half of the year, with non-COVID revenues projected to be up 11% versus same period in 2023. We expect Q4 to be an especially strong revenue quarter, given the funnel and the known seasonality challenges associated with Q3. Based on these market trends and our healthy funnel, we believe we are finally seeing the turnaround in the markets, and we are excited about the momentum going into 2025, where we expect to continue to grow above market.\r\n I'll now hand the call over to Olivier to talk about our franchise performance and the commercial efforts to develop a key account program.\n\nOlivier Loeillot\n\nThank you, Tony. Let me provide some quarterly highlights for each of our franchises. Starting with proteins, where the non-headwinds of $32 million have not changed over the last six months. We are still expecting this franchise to deliver $67 million to $72 million in revenue this year.\r\n While 2024 will be a down year for proteins, we are very optimistic about a solid rebound in 2025 based on the new protein resin we launched with Purolite in the mAb space and the impact of the Tantti technology in new modality markets.\r\n The pending acquisition of Tantti is a strategically important technology play for the company. It allows us to combine Tantti's microporous speed technology with the affinity content from Avitide and our prepacked OPUS Columns.\r\n Because we've already been working with Tantti scientists for a couple of years, we expect to be able to launch our first resins under Tantti's DuloCore as soon as quarter four. So exciting time for this franchise as we built out a best-in-class affinity rating portfolio to disrupt and take share in both mAb market with Purolite and new modality markets with Tantti.\r\n Our filtration franchise continued to perform well, with revenues up mid-single digits in Q2 and excluding COVID, up almost 10% year-to-date. Total orders have also been robust, greater than 20% year-to-date. Strength in the business is coming from ATF, TangenX flat sheet assets and systems. Total ATF systems revenues were up greater than 50% in the quarter and 40% for the first half of 2024.\r\n In Q2, we saw accelerating demand for TangenX, which was up 30% year-over-year. The flat sheet cassette uptake is another sign that destocking is behind us, as we have a broad customer base spanning CDMO and pharma. Finally, ARTeSYN systems had another strong quarter, where we continue to differentiate ourselves on systems with the integration of CTX Flow analytics technology.\r\n Moving to chromatography. While our total chrome revenues were slightly down year-on-year, we saw sequential growth of about 10%. And the most significant piece of the franchise, our OPUS portfolio, showed positive signs of recovery with revenues up high single digits in the quarter and mid-single digits for the first half of the year. Otherwise, we saw a significant increase in chromatography demand, up greater than 50% in the quarter, nearly 20% sequentially and up 15% year-to-date.\r\n For OPUS, orders in the quarter and first half of the year have been robust, up greater than 20% through the first six months of 2024, driven by strength in new modalities. On top of this, our Chrome Systems had a strong quarter on orders as we continue to see traction for our Artisan ARTeSYN product line in the field.\r\n Our analytics business had a nice pickup in revenues versus Q1 and was up mid-single digits year-over-year. We continue to focus our efforts on new modality adoption and promoting the Flow technology as part of our ARTeSYN system product offering.\r\n Finally, a big area of focus for me over the last nine months was building out our key account strategy for the company. I am delighted that our key account management team now covers 20 of our top accounts. We are very happy about the impact it has already had in 2024, and believe it will be key to our growth in 2025 and beyond.\r\n We had numerous meetings with pharma C-suite team to present our most recent innovation and broad product portfolio. The feedback is very positive, especially on the depth and breadth of what we now bring to the table.\r\n A key for me as I move into the CEO role is to maintain the focus on innovation and impact of disruptive technologies in our markets and make sure that we have increased visibility at the senior level across our customer base. We expect this, in combination with our funnel of opportunities that are moving from early to late-stage clinical and commercial, will be the catalyst for sustained long-term growth consistently above the market growth rate.\r\n Now I will turn it back to Tony to wrap up the business section.\n\nTony Hunt\n\nYes. Thanks, Olivier. So in summary, we've completed a solid first half to 2024, with revenues right in line with our expectations and orders tracking ahead of revenues by 1%. We are encouraged by the continued strength we're seeing in pharma, consumables and new modalities and by the positive uptick we saw in CDMOs and the capital equipment in Q2.\r\n There's still a lot of work to be done. We're excited about moving back into growth mode in the second half, with projected non-COVID growth of 11% at midpoint of our guidance. We remain confident about 2025 as many of the onetime headwinds facing Repligen here in 2024 will be behind us.\r\n On a personal note, I would like to thank our employees, customers and investors for giving me such support over the last 10 years. It's been a brilliant experience. When I look to the future, I'm very confident about the success of Repligen, and the company is in very capable hands with Olivier at the helm.\r\n Now I'll hand it over to Jason for the financial update.\n\nJason Garland\n\nThank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2024 and have updated our financial guidance for 2024.\r\n Revenue in the second quarter was up approximately $3 million sequentially from the first quarter as we delivered revenue of $154 million. This is a reported decline of 3% year-over-year. We're down 5% on an organic basis.\r\n Recent acquisitions contributed 3% of our reported growth and currency and COVID created about a 2% headwind. Excluding proteins, with a known headwind of approximately $8 million per quarter, our other franchises grew 3%.\r\n For the first half of 2024, we reported $305 million of revenue, in line with our expectations. First half revenues decreased 11% year-over-year, but we're up 5% if you exclude known COVID and protein headwind.\r\n As Olivier shared color on our franchise performance, I'll provide more detail on the performance across our global regions. In the second quarter of 2024, North America represented approximately 50% of our global business, while Europe represented 36% and Asia Pacific and the rest of the world represented 14%. Within Asia, China was down 38% versus the second quarter of 2023 and represented 4% of our total business in the quarter. North America grew year-over-year on strength across all franchises, except proteins, and Europe was down 3%, driven entirely by the decline in affinity ligand.\r\n All regions are up high single digit to low double digit on orders in the first half of 2024, with the exception of China. China was down more than 20% in the first half of the year, and almost 30% when you compare our first half of 2024 to the second half of 2023. We have seen no signs of recovery and do not expect to see a turnaround in 2024. Based on our first half performance, we now expect China to be approximately 4% of our worldwide sales versus our previous range of 5% to 6%, which essentially drives $10 million of our drop in revenue guidance.\r\n Second quarter 2024 adjusted gross profit was $76 million, a $4 million decrease in year-over-year on $5 million of lower revenue. With this, we delivered a 49.6% adjusted gross margin. This is down 60 basis points versus last year, driven by volume and incentive compensation headwind, mostly offset by year-over-year productivity. That said, it was sequentially up 100 basis points from the first quarter. First half of 2024 adjusted gross margin was 49.1% and remains consistent with achieving our 2024 total year guidance of 49% to 50%.\r\n Continuing through the P&L, our adjusted income from operations was $16 million in the second quarter, down approximately $14 million compared to prior year. The majority of this decline was driven by $9 million of incremental incentive compensation and the remaining from volume and inflation, partially offset by some price improvement and productivity savings.\r\n Sequentially, our adjusted operating expenses were down $1 million from the first quarter, so we are executing an estimated 7% further reduction of adjusted operating expenses in the second half versus the first half run rate. While this is a meaningful reduction, we have also increased our investments in the commercial team to add more critical key account resources.\r\n We're also seeing that the impact of some of our cost reduction initiatives will move to later in the year. Therefore, we are updating our full year guidance to reflect an additional $3 million of adjusted operating expenses.\r\n Our second quarter 2024 adjusted operating income margin improved sequentially by approximately 200 basis points to 10%. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating income margins are down roughly 8 percentage points, driven by the increase incentive compensation noted earlier and lower volume, with some offset from year-over-year cost reduction initiatives. Our second quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin rate was approximately 15%, which reflects a 5-percentage-point drag from depreciation.\r\n With cost optimization and margin expansion remaining a priority, we expect to continue to execute programs and evaluate the need for future optimization and restructuring actions. That said, we incurred less than $1 million of restructuring charges in the second quarter.\r\n Income for the quarter was $19 million, down $11 million versus last year. This was driven by the $14 million drop in adjusted operating income, offset by greater than $1 million of higher interest income, net of interest expense from improved interest rates on our cash position, and it includes approximately $1 million less adjusted tax provision.\r\n Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 18.1%, which includes a discrete benefit from stock-based compensation. Given the first half run rate, we are updating our total year adjusted effective tax rate outlook and expected to be approximately 20%, down from the prior guidance of 21%. In addition, we believe that the continued strength of our cash balance and interest rates will allow us to increase our adjusted other income outlook by approximately $6 million.\r\n Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.33 compared to $0.53 in the same period in 2023. Finally, with the strong generation of cash flow from operations in the quarter, we increased our cash position to $809 million, up $29 million from the first quarter and up $58 million from the end of 2023.\r\n I'll now move to an update on our guidance for the full year 2024. I'll speak to adjusted financial guidance. So please note that our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for our 2024 guidance are included in the reconciliation tables in today's earnings press release. And for further clarity, our guidance is fully inclusive of the FlexBiosys and Metenova acquisitions we made in 2023 but excludes any impact from the pending acquisition Tantti.\r\n As highlighted earlier by Tony, we have updated our total year adjusted guidance ranges that we shared in February and April. While we are maintaining guidance within our range, we now expect total revenue in 2024 to be between $620 million and $635 million. We expect year-over-year revenue growth in the second half of the year. At our guidance midpoint, we expect total revenue growth in the second half of 2024 to be 8% year-over-year and non-COVID revenue growth to be 11%. Overall, for the full year, we expect 2% to 5% of growth for our non-COVID business, with M&A contributing approximately 3 percentage points to that growth.\r\n We still expect to deliver adjusted gross margin in the range of 49% to 50%, essentially flat to 2023. We now expect our adjusted income from operations to be between $76 million to $81 million or 12% to 13% adjusted operating margin rate, down $7 million and down 1 percentage point from our prior guidance, respectively. $4 million of the $7 million decline is coming from lower volumes associated with our revised revenue guidance, and the remaining $3 million is coming from the increase in adjusted operating expenses discussed earlier. With the first half adjusted operating margin of 9%, we expect to be able to reach the 12% to 13% through both volume leverage and from further operating expense cost reductions in the second half.\r\n Adjusted EBITDA margins are now expected to be in the range of 17% to 18% for the year, reflective of the exclusion of roughly 500 basis points of fixed depreciation costs from capacity expansions we have made. As discussed earlier, we expect our adjusted other income to now be approximately $24 million. And our 2024 adjusted effective tax rate is now expected to be an estimated 20%.\r\n With these improvements in adjusted other income and adjusted effective tax rate, we were able to offset the adjusted operating income reduction. And we are holding our guidance for adjusted net income at $80 million to $84 million and our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.42 to $1.49.\r\n In closing, we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing in the market coming out of the second quarter. We believe that our focus on key accounts, delivering on innovation, continuing to acquire differentiated technologies like Tantti, and executing on our revenue and profitability goals sets us up well for a successful exit through the year and into 2025.\r\n And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open the lines for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Rachel Vatnsdal, JPMorgan.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nSo my first question is just around the order book. It's great to see some of this continued progress on the order intake, especially within the CDMO customers. You've been vocal about some of that lumpiness that you have been seeing on the CDMO side. And today, you called out a book-to-bill of over 1.4, and I believe you said order growth of over 20% within CDMOs as well. So can you unpack for us what really drove that strength in the CDMO market? And how durable do you think some of this strength is? And then within those CDMOs, are there any areas that are rebounding faster, whether that's consumables or equipment or certain modalities as well?\n\nTony Hunt\n\nLook, in general, I think when we look at our book-to-bill over the last four quarters, we've been very consistent as a company. We expand around 1, not a little higher than 1. I think the average over the last four quarters should been 1.04. So I think we've shown some consistent results.\r\n We talked at the end of last year about having the first quarter in 2023, where we actually saw a really strong CDMO activity in Q4. And that came from our top 10 CDMOs. So there is really strong quarter-on-quarter in Q4 of last year.\r\n We had a lighter quarter in Q1, where we have a couple of the large top 10 CDMOs. We're down under ordering pattern versus what we've seen in the past. In Q2, it was a little different. In Q2, the first time we saw the Tier 2 CDMOs come back. If you look at the last six quarters, the Tier 2 senior modes have been flat.\r\n Basically, we're in the same amount quarter after quarter, but not seeing any uptick. So it's really encouraging that the growth we saw in CDMOs in Q2 did come from the Tier 2 CDMOs. So if you look at it, two of the last three quarters have been very encouraging for CDMOs' been like. I think the next couple of quarters will tell us a lot.\r\n And just as an aside, the strength we saw in CDMOs coming from the smaller CDMOs. We also saw a similar pattern in the pharma biotech space. So again, another kind of encouraging sign that the long tail of accounts that we have and everybody else has in the industry is beginning to show some light.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nGreat. And then just on my follow-up. For seasonality, you called out the seasonality in the prepared remarks for 3Q. I mean you've heard some varying comments on seasonality across your peers that have reported so far. So can you walk us through what are you guys assuming in terms of sequential revenue growth into 3Q and then sequential revenue growth into 4Q as well? And then more broadly, can you just remind us, what do you consider normal seasonality throughout the year for Repligen?\n\nTony Hunt\n\nYes. So maybe the last part of your question, this seasonality for Repligen and for our industry tends to be Q2 strong -- very strong Q4. Lighter start to the year, with Q3 being the latest quarter. No, that's being weird for the last few years. But if you look at it over the course of 10, 15, 20 years, I don't think there's anyone in the industry in bioprocessing that wouldn't tell you that Q3 is typically the lighter for it. I think we're back to more of a normal year.\r\n If you look at our performance this year, first half of the year, ex COVID, ex-proteins, where you know we have this proteins headwind, we're up 4% on revenue. If you go into the second half of the year, we're calling the second half of the year as 11% growth, ex-COVID for Repligen. And even without COVID, we're going to be up 8% at our midpoint. So I think that's a really positive sign for us, and we do expect Q4 to be a very strong quarter. We had a strong funnel. We have a lot of orders that came in Q2. Third one is shipped out in Q4. So we're definitely heavily weighted towards Q4 versus Q3.\n\nOperator\n\nDan Arias, Stifel.\n\nDan Arias\n\nTony, new modality order is up 40%. That's pretty solid. Do you think that that says something about where the industry is in terms of improvement? Or is there a sensitivity to individual projects or customers that kind of makes it less of a broad-based comment? And then relatedly, at this point, do you have like a cell and gene therapy growth forecast for the year?\n\nTony Hunt\n\nYes. We haven't put a cell and gene therapy forecast in place for the year. Dan, if you might remember, we've moved cell and gene therapy into a new modality. So cell gene therapy, mRNA, exosomes, everything that you would put in new modalities is what we're capturing overall. And when we talk about the growth.\r\n And so when we look at last year and this year, I would say the biggest strength for us has been our top 2025 accounts. It really hasn't been the long tail of cell and gene therapy and new modality accounts. It's really been the top 2025, we'll be scaling. And that's what we saw in Q1. That's what we saw in Q2. Having a book-to-bill that's slightly above 1.1 was very encouraging for this space. But the growth is coming from late-stage commercial.\r\n And I'm not sure, Olivier, if you want to add anything to that?\n\nOlivier Loeillot\n\nYes, we are obviously benefiting from those late stage and commercial drug moving forward. And as Tony mentioned, our first half revenue were up more than 10%, and the order were up more than 20%, so we really have great traction on these new modalities across the board right now, Dan.\n\nDan Arias\n\nOkay. Helpful. And then maybe, Jason, generally speaking, when it comes to forecasting, do you feel like predictability is getting better here? I mean destockings run its course. Small and mid biotech are no longer in free fall. So obviously, we'll have to see how the back half shakes out. But come the fall, we're all going to be trying to dial in 2025.\r\n And so I'm just kind of curious whether you're more optimistic that as you start to talk about 2025 and the outlook there, the error bars around that outlook for next year should be tighter. Visibility can be better. And so therefore, I guess the idea would be that an initial forecast just has a better chance of being the one that you finish with.\n\nTony Hunt\n\nYes. Look, I mean, as we continue to see more of the green shoots and the positive sign, that gives us just, again, an overall, let's say, higher confidence on what we're seeing in the market. We've also talked about the growth in our funnel, right, in our opportunity pipeline.\r\n And then also, as we've kind of normalized back to a more traditional backlog, right, going into a quarter and going into the year. So I think all of those elements help give us better visibility. And certainly, we'll have more of that as we exit 24 and go into next year.\n\nOperator\n\nJacob Johnson, Stephens.\n\nJacob Johnson\n\nAnd Tony, congrats on a great run. On China, we've heard kind of muted commentary around that end market, but you guys kind of called out incremental pressures. Can you just unpack what you're seeing there? And then I'm just curious on China, given this will be 4% of your business this year, much smaller exposure than previously, does that change your strategy around that end market?\n\nJason Garland\n\nI'll take this question. I think we can really further deterioration in order that we went through Q2. And only the forecast from our team is pretty tough for the second half of this year, which is why we decided to reduce our guidance expectation by 10 million, and this is really coming from China.\r\n So we've taken some action down there. We've even decided to rightsize the team in the region, and we are now looking like we will and probably around 25 million in 2024. So it's a significant drop for us this year versus last year.\n\nJacob Johnson\n\nOkay. Got it. And then maybe just Jason on margins and kind of pacing in the back half of this year, you talked about, I think, another 7% to come out in 2H. Can you just help us on the timing of that between 3Q and 4Q as we're thinking about modeling OpEx in the back half?\n\nJason Garland\n\nYes, definitely. Look, I mean, for margins, we've been continuing to drive the optimization and cost-saving activities that we've talked about, right, our RPS programs site consolidations be very diligent on our spending. So you saw some of that improvement already, right, in the second quarter versus the first quarter, we went up in both gross margin and then also the operating margins.\r\n Gross margin is already tracking as the total year guide in and expect that to kind of stay there, maybe a little higher in the fourth quarter as that goes more to the high end of the range that we've given, maybe slightly above. And then as we continue to take actions and see the benefits of the actions that we've taken that are already in flight at the operating expense level, then again, we kind of see that step again in third quarter.\r\n And then fourth quarter, again, when you look at the overall guidance we've given from a revenue profile, that's where you'll really see a bit higher leverage that you get into the fourth quarter. So step up in 3, and then a bit more in the fourth quarter. And that would get us to around that 12% to 13% op margin for the year. And again, that's really driven by both volume improvement as well in the volume leverage you get with that as well as the operating expense reduction. So continue to execute.\n\nOperator\n\nPuneet Souda, Leerink Partners.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nAnd Olivier, congrats. Great to have you on board. And Tony, it's been really a pleasure working with you over the years.\r\n So my first question is on CDMOs. Tony, can you tell a little bit more about what is driving the growth behind the CDMOs? You pointed outgrowth in Tier 2. Is it biotech funding? Is it modality-specific? We continue to hear about some facilities being underutilized and rationalization going on in the facilities. So I just want to understand the dynamics here. And how much of this is maybe the new modalities running through CDMOs and maybe the DMD drug picking up?\n\nTony Hunt\n\nYes. So on the CDMOs, I would say that early days, right? So two out of the last three quarters look good. One quarter was the -- our top 10 CDMO showing real order growth. And we're talking about orders here because revenue has been really light from the CDMO space. And then obviously, in Q2, it was more the Tier 2.\r\n So we're really encouraged that the Tier 2 is a top spot. We think it's a combination, honestly, of destocking finally being over, where a lot of the CDMOs either had inventory on hand or had a lower number of projects that we're coming through. So there's been a pickup in projects. It's been a pickup in activity, and we think that's encouraging. But obviously, we need to see a few more quarters of that as we go through the second half of the year.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And then one of the questions we continue to get frequently is 2025. Could you maybe elaborate a jumping off point from the fourth quarter? And is it fair to say with the guidance now lower to flat for this year, is low teens to mid-teens the right way to think about it versus the 15% to 20% long-term growth that you had outlined previously?\n\nTony Hunt\n\nYes. This is a good question, Puneet, I'll say the following, right? We're going to wait until the end of the year to talk about 2025. That said, second half of 2024, we're going to be up 11% ex COVID. So I think that's very encouraging. We think our forecast or guidance that we put in place in the second half of the year is very achievable.\r\n We fully expect that when we get into 2025, we're going to grow above market. And so we'll wait until we get to end of the year, and we'll give a lot more commentary on 2025. But obviously, very encouraged by kind of how we performed in the first half of the year. You can see where we're going in the second half of the year. Next year, we're confident about being above market growth.\n\nOperator\n\nJustin Bowers, Deutsche Bank.\n\nJustin Bowers\n\nSo two questions, one on the opportunity funnel and then one more strategic. But could you talk about the funnel a little bit and how that's changed throughout the year? And maybe how things paced in 2Q and early into 3Q?\n\nOlivier Loeillot\n\nSo the funnel continues to strengthen. I mean of 50-plus probability we're up significantly year-over-year. We're happy about that, but it's also increasing sequentially from quarter one to quarter two.\r\n But also, the total funnel also keeps on increasing, so we are really happy about that. With some of the newcomers we had joining the team as well, we've got much more discipline in quantifying and accounting for those lates, which is giving us also so much more visibility, just so you know.\n\nJustin Bowers\n\nOkay. And then in terms of strategy, you just made this acquisition for the resin beads, and you've had the partnership with Purolite a couple of years ago. Can you talk about how your approach to that market and some high-level thoughts on the opportunity there? And how that can contribute to growth over the next three to five years?\n\nJason Garland\n\nYes. So I'll start, and then I'll hand it over to Olivier for some additional comments. So nothing has changed in terms of our interaction with Purolite Ecolab now or going forward because the way we view it is that our partnership with Purolite is very much on the mAb side, and we're fully committed to that. And we've been launching products.\r\n In fact, in Q2, we launched a brand-new protein A resin that is high-cost, high capacity and also protease resistance. So it's a unique protein A ligand presence that's being launched, and we're very hopeful about how that's going to do in the marketplace.\r\n One of the things that we tried to do when we did the Avitide deal was Avitide was really going to be our way of moving in, in a deeper way into the new modality space. The challenge in the new modality space is that the majority of molecules in new modality are very large molecules. So like viruses, they're nucleic acids, they're viral vectors. It requires a very unique base feed structure.\r\n So the typical agros feeds that customers use or even suppliers use usually do not address the need for a higher capacity and higher throughput that's required in this space. So a lot of times, people look at membranes, but then membranes have pretty low capacity.\r\n So when we started working with Tantti, we realized that the Tantti technology is the perfect combination of our Avitide content with the base speed that gives you the attributes that I just spoke about. So early days, very hopeful that this combination is really going to unlock the power of Avitide. But without Tantti, you can't get there. So it's the two together that will be disruptive in the industry.\r\n I'm not sure Olivier, if you want to add to that?\n\nOlivier Loeillot\n\nI would just like you said, yes, the new modalities require a new clarification solutions that do not exist yet, but also customization is very important because within those new modalities, every product requires a kind of very different technologies. And our Avitide offering is very good because within three months, we can develop new ligands. And within six months now with Tantti, we can have a full rating operational for customers. So we're very excited about that opportunity here.\n\nOperator\n\nMatt Larew, William Blair.\n\nMatt Larew\n\nThere was substantial capacity added throughout COVID by you and others in the industry. And I think there was a perception in the investor community that because of the right size in the pipelines and the funding environment, perhaps there would be a change to what historically have been very positive market forces in terms of the ability to pass through inflation, working with sole sources, et cetera.\r\n So I'm just curious now as you sort of emerge past destocking what your sort of initial take is on the market forces going forward? Again, whether that's on pricing, multisource versus single source, your own competitive position, et cetera?\n\nOlivier Loeillot\n\nMatthew, we think the bio profit product portfolio, there are a lot of different situations. I mean, what I think which is very unique about this, with our innovation, when you look at the different product lines we're into, we don't have that much competition because of the innovative factors we're bringing to the table here. So having capacity available in products, in fact, seems to be a real great opportunity because that will enable us to support our customers a growing demand in the next few years.\r\n Then obviously, if you look at some specific areas, and I would probably mention that a single-use industry, there expect be much more capacity available today, and probably this will generate more competitive price between the key actors in the field. But really, again, innovation is a patent for Repligen and thanks to that, we are likely having that available capacity from the equation going forwards.\n\nMatt Larew\n\nOkay. And then just maybe one more follow-up on the CDMO side. You referenced earlier, broadly sort of equipment versus consumables, just kind of curious as the CDMO strength brought into Tier 2 is what you're seeing in terms of equipment for consumables? And if that's perhaps indicative of new projects being started versus perhaps old projects being turned on? Any additional color there would be helpful.\n\nTony Hunt\n\nMaybe I'll start on that. I think on the CDMO front, when we look at capital equipment, and we look at the orders that came in for capital equipment because we had a lighter quarter on revenue for capital equipment in Q2, but orders were strong. But it definitely expand CDMOs and expand pharma.\r\n I don't think there was a particular weighting towards CDMO in the quarter versus pharma. I think it was just across the board. And I think it reflects really the competitiveness of our RS product line, which is the ARTeSYN product line. And it's something that we've been very focused on.\r\n So I don't think there's anything to draw in terms of whether capital equipment was stronger in CDMO versus pharma. I just think we had an update uptick in orders for the RS portfolio in the quarter.\r\n Olivier, I'm not sure if you want to add to that?\n\nOlivier Loeillot\n\nNo.\n\nOperator\n\nConor McNamara, RBC Capital Markets.\n\nConor McNamara\n\nJust given some of the commentary in your prepared remarks on improving funnel and orders relative to what you talked about in Q1. Why did the non-China revenue guide not increase? Because everything sounds like the funnel definitely improving. So how did that flow through to a guidance increase on the non-China business?\n\nTony Hunt\n\nYes. So good question, Connor. Look, when you look at our guidance, you're right, the guidance sort of 1% drop off midpoint is really coming from China. We think we put, honestly, the right guidance in place at the beginning of the year. Everything is holding. We believe we'll be in the range that we have outlined today. The only drop off really is going to China. We expect, by the end of the year, we're going to be in that range.\r\n We're showing consistency from quarter-to-quarter, which I think is very encouraging, and we're showing, Conor, 11% growth ex COVID in the second half of the year. I think that's really encouraging.\n\nConor McNamara\n\nGreat. And then just can you comment on the intra-quarter progression in activity? And if you can any -- what progress you're seeing so far in July?\n\nTony Hunt\n\nSo the intra-quarter progress, Conor, in Q2 are intra-quarter progress Q3.\n\nConor McNamara\n\nQ2 and how July is stacking up so far?\n\nTony Hunt\n\nYes. So Q2, I think, was -- as you know, when we reported out at the end of April, we had a solid April. And then I think June was stronger than May, but there was nothing -- they were all pretty consistent, with June being definitely being stronger than the first two months. And then July, off to a solid start.\r\n I mean we're still early days of the quarter. And typically, this is one of the later quarters just simply because of seasonality and most of Europe on vacation, for at least a month of August.\n\nOperator\n\nDan Leonard, UBS.\n\nDan Leonard\n\nI have a follow-up question on sales phasing in the second half of the year. Can you clarify you expect Q3 revenue to be down sequentially and also lower than Q1 revenue. Is that correct?\n\nTony Hunt\n\nNo, we're not saying that's going to be lower than Q1 revenue. We're thinking it's in that range of Q1 to Q2. So it's definitely in the 1 to 1.55 range. That's probably where we see it.\n\nDan Leonard\n\nGot it. And then, Tony, can you clarify what is the order growth assumption in Q3 sequentially, order growth assumption required to hit that fourth quarter ramp?\n\nTony Hunt\n\nYes, there is no -- like our order assumption is the second half of the year order assumption. So the order assumption is 4% order growth in the second half of the year to hit the midpoint of our guidance. That's 5% revenue growth in the second half of the year to hit the midpoint for guidance.\n\nOperator\n\nPaul Knight, KeyBanc.\n\nPaul Knight\n\nCould you talk to what percent of revenue is from, I would say, new modalities? But I think the definition more would be where you really have limited competition, such as OPUS, BPE, ATF, Avitide. What's your kind of percentage range on that, Olivier or Tony?\n\nTony Hunt\n\nYes. So Paul, I would say on new modalities, about 20% of our revenue is coming from new modalities. Obviously, we've had a good first half of the year. The growth is coming from the top 2025 accounts. I think it's really hard to bundle all the other product lines that we have that we would say are somewhat unique to Repligen.\r\n In general, if you take outside our sort of management space, everything else is somewhat unique and independent. So hard to put a number on it. But I would say, in the second half of the year, the 11% growth ex COVID is probably a good proxy for how those businesses are all growing in the second half of the year.\n\nPaul Knight\n\nAnd then the last question on my side would be under the account management structure that you implemented. Olivier, how much of the growth we're seeing is coming from that. Or I guess a better way to think about it, as we think about 11% growth, how much of that is coming from this effectiveness of the sales change? Is it half a quarter? Can you talk to that?\n\nOlivier Loeillot\n\nActually, so it's still a little bit early there. As you know, as we really put in place an organization about a year ago. So we are really off to a very great start. In fact, the performance both from a sales and order point of view is really great. So far, we really want to see how 2024 plays out, and then we will be able to give more details probably by 2025. But yes, the traction we're getting from the key account team is actually better right now.\n\nOperator\n\nMatt Hewitt, Craig-Hallum Capital Group.\n\nMatt Hewitt\n\nMaybe first up on a high-level view. Some of your peers have talked about or have noted a lag from the improving funding environment to the orders and purchases, yet you spoke to a pretty strong book-to-bill, strong order flow. Are you maybe seeing earlier progress because of the funding? Or is there a chance that you could see an acceleration even in some of the ordering patterns that you've already seen here in Q2?\n\nTony Hunt\n\nYes, I think the commentary from our peers is consistent with our thoughts and feelings as well. There definitely is a lag from improving biotech funding to orders. There's no doubt about it.\r\n So when we look at our Q2 and rightfully, you're pointing out that our book-to-bill was higher than what others have seen. I think it's more around the consistency that we've been able to put into how we perform as a company over the last four quarters. And we've been around that 1.0, 1.04, I think is the average.\r\n As Olivier said earlier, we have a lot of unique products in our portfolio. So I think that helps a little bit. We also probably didn't have as much of the destocking to deal with as some of the other players in the industry. So I think that's also a positive for us.\r\n But we feel like this is being the turning point in the markets. We expect, as we move into the high single-digit overall growth to low double-digit ex COVID, that that's a real positive sign as we exit 2024 and move into 2025.\n\nMatt Hewitt\n\nGot it. And then maybe separately, you're implementing another 7% cost reduction here in the second half. Is there any risk that the markets come back faster than you're forecasting or anticipating and you kind of get caught a little flat-footed from a headcount perspective. I think this is what the third cost optimization that you've implemented here in the past year or so. And I'm just wondering if there's any risk that if the markets come back quickly, you might not be able to adapt fast enough.\n\nTony Hunt\n\nI think we feel like we're well, I'll say, set up to execute. And a lot of the cost savings that will continue to fall through in the second half have been continuing to then and flight and happen to be more on the operating expense side.\r\n Certainly, at the factory level, we have that capacity to grow here in the second half and we established to go into '25. So I don't really see that as a risk for us. We've been managing this very closely and have good line of sight.\r\n And Matt, I wouldn't think about it as cost reductions as most. It's more like we are now in a mode where we put a lot more focus on productivity and in-sourcing because of all the deals we've done over the last 9 or 10 years. That gives us opportunities to reduce internal costs. So it's kind of a bigger picture of cost reduction, but there's a lot of positive things going on internally in the company that are more productivity-related, in-sourcing related, just looking at supplier management, all of those things help towards an improving margin profile for the company.\n\nOperator\n\nMatt Stanton, Jefferies.\n\nMatt Stanton\n\nMaybe one for Tony or Olivier. I want to ask a question that was talked about a little bit earlier. You talked about your ability to drive above-market growth here in the back half of the year in '25. I guess the question is, what is market growth? How do we think about the growth algorithm for the industry going forward?\r\n Clearly, mAbs remain a big driver. Commercial volumes, new modalities scaling up. Biotech funding a little better, but China is tough. There's an ongoing debate on yield improvements, pricing. There's a lot of moving pieces. But if you had to package it up, how do we think about kind of market growth going forward? Should it be at, call it, pre-COVID levels? I guess it's less about Repligen's ability to outgrow the market and really what is the market growth you're outgrowing?\n\nTony Hunt\n\nYes, the way I look at it is you can see the progress that everybody in bioprocessing has made, especially in Q2. So as our peers reported out over the last week to 10 days, I think there's a lot more green shoots now than there was 12 months ago.\r\n And yes, we need to -- it needs to be determined a little bit what overall market growth is going to be as we go forward. We're not the market leader. So it's kind of hard for me to tell you that our market growth is going to be X percent in 2025.\r\n I think what we do know is, historically, 8% to 12% has been a really good proxy over the course of 5, 10, 15 years to represent market and bioprocesses. So whether the overall market growth next year is at the low end of that, medium end of that, remains to be seen. And we'll see when the bigger players report out at the end of the year or actually beginning of next year on what they see as overall market growth. But it's definitely going to be better than 2024, and I think we're trending in the right direction for everyone.\n\nMatt Stanton\n\nThat's helpful. And Jason, maybe one on margins, your updated guide implied kind of mid-10s operating margins in the back half of the year. Any more color you can provide as we think about a tipping off point for '25? I understand a lot depends on where top line lands next year, but in terms of cost out site efficiency, it sounds like a little bit of spending is coming back in on the commercial side. Can you maybe talk a little bit about kind of what's in your control for '25? And what's tied to top line?\r\n And then any finer point you could put on potential incremental margins as the top line comes back and return to double digits next year? I think the second half incrementals here are pretty healthy. So on your point, you can put on as we think about incrementals for 2025?\n\nJason Garland\n\nYes. Well, certainly, we're not ready to issue our full guide -- our guide on '25. But I go back to Tony's point about we've got a bigger picture effort on how we continue to manage costs and drive efficiency each and every day. And so that will certainly be a tailwind for us as we go into '25. And also, certainly, as you look at the profile of profitability through, as we've gone from first quarter to second quarter and as we go from third to fourth, but that gives us a good jump-off point as well as we go into 2025.\r\n And again, the framework by which we'll ultimately guide on '25 will be continuing to drive gross margin improvement. And then getting more leverage, if you will, on top line growth outpacing our OpEx, and that's where we'll really see it fall through at the operating margin level. So I think we're positioning ourselves well and more comments as we get into the beginning of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nTom DeBourcy, Nephron Research.\n\nTom DeBourcy\n\nI'll keep this short just because I know we're very over, but just if you could remind me on your visibility? Just in terms of -- my recollection is that you typically have pretty strong visibility at a 6-month basis in terms of more firm orders. And so there's been some questions around, I guess, weakness in Q3 moving to Q4. So can you just comment a little bit more about that specific visibility that you have kind of through the end of this year?\n\nOlivier Loeillot\n\nYes. I mean, before COVID, most of the bioprocessing company had about three to four months of backlog in hand. And then during COVID, it jumped up to about 10 months for each of the bioprocessing companies. So it changed the picture completely. But one of the reasons why all of the book-to-bill has been like -- they're very left behind on from the last period is because we went back to probably a typical three to four months the backlog in our hand.\r\n So when you think about it, when you have about three to four months of backlog, you typically enter in the quarter having about 60%, 65% [financial quarter fixture], meaning you need to collect about one-third of your quarter in the quarter. And then the rest you have in your backlog being in the next quarter and then a little bit in the second quarter or beyond. But yes, typically three to four months of backlog and 60%, 65% out the quarter peak headwind when you're entering the new quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nSubbu Nambi, Guggenheim Securities.\n\nSubbu Nambi\n\nActually an extension to Tom's question on (technical difficulty). Where would you say you have the best (technical difficulty) for second half? Would it be (technical difficulty)? Would it be CDMO versus pharma? Or would it be customer sided?\n\nTony Hunt\n\nTo repeat, it was hard to hear, are you asking if the second half of the year is going to be more driven by CDMO versus pharma? It was hard to hear, sorry.\n\nSubbu Nambi\n\nExactly. So the (technical difficulty) gives you the confidence on the second half trends. Would you say you have a better handle on CDMOs or pharma biotech or customer side?\n\nTony Hunt\n\nYes, I would say that pharma has been a real strength for us through the first half of the year. So I expect that, that will continue for the second half of the year. Consumables have been really strong first half of the year. Organic consumables stayed strong. Same thing on new modalities.\r\n I think you're right. Wildcard's a little bit how much we see of the consistency from CDMOs and how much capital equipment comes back, but we would expect capital equipment to be stronger in the second half of the year, given that customers tend to purchase in late Q3 going into Q4. So I think for us, the more important piece is for us to get the midpoint of the guidance. We need 4% order growth, 5% revenue growth. I think that's achievable.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Tony Hunt for any closing remarks.\n\nTony Hunt\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys, for joining us. And the last time for me to say this, but we'll see you guys back in November. And obviously, Olivier will be leading the conversations, and look forward to listening in on the progress that Repligen will be making as we go through the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Repligen (RGEN) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.33 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This compares to earnings of $0.53 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nA quarter ago, it was expected that this drug developer would post earnings of $0.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.28, delivering a surprise of -3.45%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.\n\nRepligen , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, posted revenues of $154.07 million for the quarter ended June 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.16%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $159.17 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nRepligen shares have lost about 23.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 14.5%.\n\nWhat's Next for Repligen?\n\nWhile Repligen has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Repligen: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.38 on $161.78 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.46 on $637.24 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Biomedical and Genetics is currently in the top 33% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nEmergent Biosolutions (EBS), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 6.\n\nThis biopharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.97 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nEmergent Biosolutions' revenues are expected to be $199.47 million, down 41% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Repligen Corporation\n\nReports second quarter revenue of $154 million Second quarter orders of $157 million Book-to-bill 1.02 for the quarter, 1.01 year-to-date Achieved first half revenue and order targets Narrows revenue guidance within previous range for fiscal year 2024; adjusted EPS guidance unchanged\n\nWALTHAM, Mass., July 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Repligen Corporation (NASDAQ:RGEN), a life sciences company focused on bioprocessing technology leadership, today reported financial results for its second quarter (Q2) of 2024, covering the three- and six- month periods ended June 30, 2024. Provided in this press release are financial performance highlights, updates to our guidance for the full year 2024 and access information for today\u2019s webcast and conference call.\n\nTony J. Hunt, Chief Executive Officer of Repligen said, \u201cWe delivered solid second quarter revenue of $154 million and first half revenue of $305 million, achieving our year-to-date sales target. We are very encouraged by orders in the quarter, with continued strength in Pharma demand and a pickup in CDMO activity. New modalities continued to show strong year-over-year momentum in both revenue and orders. Strategically, we strengthened our Proteins business with new product launches and our pending acquisition of Tantti Laboratory. We continue to expect the second half of 2024 to outpace the first half on both revenue and orders. While we are narrowing our revenue guidance to reflect incremental China weakness, we are confident in Repligen\u2019s ability to resume above-industry growth in the second half of 2024 and into 2025.\u201d\n\nQ2 2024 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\n\nCEO Transition.

We are \u201cinspiring advances in bioprocessing\u201d for the customers we serve; primarily biopharmaceutical drug developers and contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) worldwide. Our focus areas are Filtration and Fluid Management, Chromatography, Process Analytics and Proteins. Our corporate headquarters are in Waltham, Massachusetts, and the majority of our manufacturing sites are in the U.S., with additional key sites in Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden. For more information about the company see our website at www.repligen.com, and follow us on LinkedIn.\n\nNon-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance\n\nTo supplement our financial statements, which are presented on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the following Adjusted (non-GAAP) measures of financial performance are included in this release: book-to-bill ratios, organic revenue growth, base business revenue growth, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin; adjusted cost of goods sold; adjusted R&D expense; adjusted SG&A expense; adjusted pre-tax income; adjusted income from operations; adjusted net income; adjusted earnings per share-diluted; adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and adjusted EBITDA margin. The Company provides base revenue and base revenue growth rates, which exclude COVID-related revenue, and the impact of acquisition revenue for current year periods that have no prior year comparables, to facilitate a comparison of its current revenue performance. The Company provides the impact of foreign currency translation, to enable determination of revenue growth rates at constant currency, which exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, in order to facilitate a comparison of its current revenue performance to its past revenue performance. To calculate the impact of foreign currency translation, the Company converts actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period.\n\nThe Company\u2019s non-GAAP financial results and/or non-GAAP guidance exclude the impact of: acquisition and integration costs; restructuring charges including the costs of severance and accelerated depreciation among other charges; incremental costs attributed to CEO transition; contingent consideration related to the Company\u2019s acquisitions; intangible amortization costs; non-cash interest expense related to the accretion of the debt discount; amortization of debt issuance costs related to Company\u2019s convertible debt; foreign currency impact of certain intercompany loans; and, the related impact on tax of non-GAAP charges. These costs are excluded because management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, nor do the resulting charges recorded accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recorded.\n\nNOTE:\r\nAll reconciliations of above GAAP figures (reported or guidance) to adjusted (non-GAAP) figures are detailed in the tables included later in this press release. When analyzing the Company\u2019s operating performance and guidance, investors should not consider non-GAAP measures as a substitute for the comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nForward-Looking Statement\n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to and in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws, including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(3 ) In July 2023, we began restructuring activities to simplify and streamline our organization and strengthen the overall effectiveness of our operations. The Company continued further restructuring activities during the three months ended June 30, 2024 including severance, employee-related and facility exit costs. Included in cost of goods sold for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 is $1,028 and $3,035 respectively, for benefit received on the sale of inventory that had previously been reserved as part of the Restructuring Plan. (4 ) Includes $4,352 of incremental stock compensation expense recorded during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 attributable to the transition of the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) to Executive Chair of the Board announced by the Company on June 12, 2024. The incremental stock compensation expense was the result of the modification of the unvested equity awards held by the CEO immediately prior to the modification. This resulted in the revalue of his unvested awards and a change in his remaining requisite service period due to his change in duties upon transitioning to Executive Chair of the Board. (5 ) During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 we recorded foreign currency adjustments on certain intercompany loans of ($342) and $3,445 respectively. The impact was recorded to the Other (expenses) income, net line item within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. (6 ) Includes amortization of milestone payments in accordance with GAAP of $27 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 and $55 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. (7 ) Excludes $19 of accelerated depreciation related to the restructuring plan for the six months ended June 30, 2024. This amount is included in the depreciation line item of this table for that period.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The market expects Exact Sciences (EXAS) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 31, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis molecular diagnostics company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.37 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +17.8%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $688.6 million, up 10.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.96% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Exact Sciences?\n\nFor Exact Sciences, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -10.81%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Exact Sciences will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Exact Sciences would post a loss of $0.50 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.50, delivering no surprise.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nExact Sciences doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, Repligen (RGEN) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.33 per share for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -37.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $154.33 million, down 3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Repligen has been revised 0.4% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -8.49%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Repligen will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 20 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Repligen Corporation (NASDAQ:RGEN) stands against the other profitable stocks.\n\nThe stock market has a long history of generating wealth for investors. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, studying successful companies can provide valuable insights. By understanding the factors that drive these companies' growth, we can potentially make better investment decisions in the future. It's important to remember that investing involves risk, and conducting thorough research is crucial before making any investment decisions.\n\nInvestors frequently overlook revenue in favor of profitability when evaluating stocks. Profit is what's left over after all costs are paid. Revenue is the total amount of goods and services sold. Because it is essential to determine if a business is a growth stock or a value one, profitability is important. To learn more about growth stocks, see 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024. You can also discover some undervalued value stocks by reading 11 Oversold Value Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThe U.S. stock market has seen several major events since 2000, including the dot-com boom and fall, the 2008 financial crisis, a tech boom with trillion-dollar values, and the 2020 pandemic crisis. The S&P's broader market index produced double-digit yearly returns thirteen times between 2003 and 2023. This strong performance can be largely attributed to the phenomenal returns generated by technology stocks, which significantly boosted the overall return of the large-cap market.\n\nAccording to a recent estimate, the aggregate market value of the top seven S&P 500 corporations is almost double that of the Japanese market. The head of topical research and global economics, Jim Reid, cautions that this is the most concentrated the US market has ever been.\n\nAs interest in growth stocks increases due to the hype surrounding AI and the prospect of rate cuts, these companies' fortunes are expected to soar. To satisfy market demand, businesses are making significant investments in AI. AI's impact on altering work patterns was highlighted by Satya Nadella du. According to them,:\n\n\u201cA growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo identify the most profitable stocks, we looked at the 20-year annualized returns of publicly traded companies in the US market from 2004 to 2024 and selected and ranked those with the highest 20-year annualized returns.\n\nStory continues\n\nA technician in a lab inspecting an ELISA test kit for use in biopharmaceutical diagnostics.\n\nRepligen Corporation (NASDAQ:RGEN)\n\n20-Year Annualized Return: 21.97%\n\nRepligen Corporation (NASDAQ:RGEN) is a leading provider of advanced bioprocessing technologies and solutions for the biopharmaceutical industry. Repligen specializes in developing and manufacturing products used in the production of biological drugs, including monoclonal antibodies, gene therapies, and vaccines.\u00a0 The company's key developments include the launch of the KrosFlo RS10, a bench-scale TFF system for cell and gene therapies, and the completion of customizable 2D and 3D bags for their Fluid Management portfolio.\n\nRepligen Corporation (NASDAQ:RGEN) experienced a revenue decline in Q1 2024, with total revenue dropping 17.2% to $151.3 million from $182.7 million in Q1 2023. However, there were positive areas of growth, including a 16% year-over-year increase in new modalities revenue and double-digit growth in the Filtration franchise. Despite the overall decline, the company reported a book-to-bill ratio of 0.99 for the quarter and 1.03 over the past nine months, indicating a slow but steady market recovery. The recent acquisition of Metenova also continued to meet both revenue and order targets, contributing positively to the company's performance.\n\nIn Q1 2024, there were around 32 hedge fund holders in the company, up from 31 in the previous quarter. Impax Asset Management held the largest share in the company with 681,020 shares worth $124,514,760.\n\nRepligen stock has an average \"Buy\" rating from 11 analysts. Nine analysts' 12-month price forecasts average at $193, with estimates ranging from $155 to $220. This predicts a potential increase of 59.81% from the current stock price of $120.77.\n\nOverall RGEN ranks 9th on our list of the most profitable stocks of the last 20 years.

While we acknowledge the potential of RGEN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "What Is Repligen Corporation's (NASDAQ:RGEN) Share Price Doing?",
        "content": "While Repligen Corporation (NASDAQ:RGEN) might not have the largest market cap around , it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$200 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$123. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Repligen's current trading price of US$123 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Repligen\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nView our latest analysis for Repligen\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Repligen?\n\nGood news, investors! Repligen is still a bargain right now. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $158.05, but it is currently trading at US$123 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Repligen\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nWhat does the future of Repligen look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Repligen. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since RGEN is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on RGEN for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy RGEN. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

        "title": "Repligen (RGEN) Down 10.9% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?",
        "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Repligen (RGEN). Shares have lost about 10.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Repligen due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nRepligen Q1 Earnings Miss, Revenues Beat Estimates\n\nRepligen reported first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share of 28 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents. The company had recorded adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.\n\nTotal revenues were $151.3 million, down 17.2% year over year on a reported basis and 20% organically.\u00a0 Revenues, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $150 million.\n\nThe year-over-year decrease in total revenues can be attributed to the absence of COVID-related revenues and the expected decrease in revenues from protein franchisees.\n\nQuarter in Detail\n\nThe company reported product revenues of $151.3 million, down 17.1% from the year-ago period. It also reported royalty and other revenues of $0.04 million, almost flat year over year.\n\nRepligen\u2019s base business revenues of $145 million declined 9.4% year over year, owing to the anticipated decline in revenues from proteins business on lower affinity ligands and resin demand.\n\nThe company\u2019s base business can be categorized under four franchises \u2014 filtration, chromatography, protein and process analytics.\n\nRevenues from the chromatography business improved slightly on a sequential basis. RGEN expects revenues to improve further in the second quarter as the chromatography business continues to recover from the resin shortage challenges.\n\nThe filtration franchise\u2019s sales grew more than 10% year over year, while non-COVID filtration revenues grew more than 15% on a sequential basis, driven by the success of ATF.\n\nRevenues in the protein franchise declined both on a year-over-year basis and on a sequential basis due to weak demand reflecting the Cytiva (a standalone operating company owned by Danaher Corporation) drop-off since it is producing product in-house and lower forecast for ligands from other customers.\n\nThough the analytics business had a slow start in the first quarter, Repligen continues to see strong demand for FlowVPX and real-time process management or RPM, which is the growth driving factor for this business unit.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenues from the company\u2019s new modalities business, which includes cell and gene therapy and mRNA, were up more than 15% year on year in the reported quarter.\n\nNewly acquired, Metenova generated revenues of more than $5 million in the first quarter of 2024, in line with management\u2019s expectations.\n\nAdjusted gross margin was 48.6% in the first quarter, down 60 basis points year over year.\n\nAdjusted research and development expenses totaled approximately $11 million, down almost 9.8% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level.\n\nAdjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $50.8 million, up 6.3% year over year.\n\nAdjusted operating income totaled $11.8 million, down almost 71% from the prior year quarter.\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, Repligen had cash and cash equivalents worth $780.6 million compared with $751.3 million as of Dec 31, 2023.\n\n2024 Guidance\n\nRepligen reiterated the guidance it had provided earlier this year. The company expects total revenues in the range of $620-$650 million for 2024. Adjusted EPS is anticipated to be between $1.42 and $1.49 in 2024.\n\nThe company anticipates base business revenues to be down 1% to up 4% in 2024.\n\nAdjusted net income is estimated in the band of $80-$84 million. Adjusted operating income is anticipated in the $83-$88 million range.\n\nRepligen expects adjusted gross margin in the 49 range. Adjusted operating margin is anticipated in the band of 13.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, estimates review flatlined during the past month.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, Repligen has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nRepligen has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nRepligen belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry. Another stock from the same industry, Biogen Inc. (BIIB), has gained 3.1% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2024.\n\nBiogen reported revenues of $2.29 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -7%. EPS of $3.67 for the same period compares with $3.40 a year ago.\n\nFor the current quarter, Biogen is expected to post earnings of $3.98 per share, indicating a change of -1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Biogen. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of B.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Despite lower earnings than five years ago, Repligen (NASDAQ:RGEN) investors are up 101% since then",
        "content": "Repligen Corporation (NASDAQ:RGEN) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 22% in the last quarter. But that scarcely detracts from the really solid long term returns generated by the company over five years. Indeed, the share price is up an impressive 101% in that time. Generally speaking the long term returns will give you a better idea of business quality than short periods can. The more important question is whether the stock is too cheap or too expensive today.\n\nIn light of the stock dropping 7.9% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Repligen\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nRepligen's earnings per share are down 11% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.\n\nEssentially, it doesn't seem likely that investors are focused on EPS. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.\n\nIn contrast revenue growth of 23% per year is probably viewed as evidence that Repligen is growing, a real positive. It's quite possible that management are prioritizing revenue growth over EPS growth at the moment.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nRepligen is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for Repligen in this interactivegraph of future profit estimates.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nRepligen shareholders are down 9.4% for the year, but the market itself is up 27%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 15% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  3 warning signs for Repligen  you should know about.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe will like Repligen better if we see some big insider buys.

Reported EPS is $0.28 EPS, expectations were $0.29. Repligen Corporation isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Repligen Corporation's First Quarter of 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Keith, and I will be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today's call, Sondra Newman, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nSondra Newman: Thank you, operator. And welcome to our first quarter of 2024 report. On this call, we will cover business highlights and financial performance for the three-month period ending March 31, 2024, and we will provide financial guidance for the year. Joining us on the call today are Repligen's CEO, Tony Hunt; our CFO, Jason Garland; and our Chief Commercial Officer, Olivier Loeillot. As a reminder, the forward-looking statements that we make during this call, including those regarding our business goals and expectations for the financial performance of the company, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events or results to differ. Additional information concerning risks related to our business is included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our annual report on Form 10-K, and our current report on Form 8-K, including the report that we're filing today and other filings that we make with the SEC.\n\nToday's comments reflect management's current views, which could change as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The company does not obligate or commit itself to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. During this call, we are providing non-GAAP financial results and guidance, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are included in the press release that we issued this morning, which is posted to Repligen's website and on sec.gov. Adjusted non-GAAP figures in today's report include the following: book-to-bill ratios, organic revenue growth, base business revenue which excludes COVID and M&A, non-COVID revenue, cost of sales, gross profit and gross margin; operating expenses, including R&D and SG&A; income from operations and operating margins; other income; pretax income; effective tax rate; net income; diluted earnings per share as well as EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese adjusted financial measures should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures, but are intended to best reflect the performance of our ongoing operations. Now let me turn the call over to Tony Hunt.\n\nAnthony Hunt: Thank you, Sondra. And good morning, everyone. And welcome to our Q1 earnings call. As you saw in our press release this morning, we delivered a solid first quarter on revenue and orders. With Q1 revenues coming in at $151 million, we are right on track to delivering $300 million to $310 million in the first half of 2024. Orders were in line with our expectations, resulting in a book to bill of 0.99 in the first quarter and 1.03 over the past nine months. We're satisfied with these results, especially in light of top sequential and year-on-year comps and the known headwinds in COVID, proteins and China. During the first quarter of last year, 2023, we realized $23 million of COVID-related revenue, none of which was recurring.\n\nAnd as we shared with you on our February call, we anticipate proteins headwinds up over $30 million in 2024, which we saw play out during the first quarter. Importantly, we continue to see signs of recovery in the market and feel confident that the de-stocking challenges are behind us for the most part. Our confidence is reinforced by what we are seeing in filtration performance, consumables demand and new modality momentum. In Filtration, our largest franchise, year-on-year, non-COVID filtration orders were up 20% in Q1 and revenue was up by more than 10%. We also saw a nice sequential uptick in non-COVID filtration revenue of greater than 15%. Regarding consumable orders, where de-stocking has been the most pronounced, we've seen a positive uptick in demand outside of proteins.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, these consumable orders increased by more than 10%, both sequentially and year-on-year. Both sales and orders from new modality accounts were another area of strength at levels higher both sequentially and year-on-year. New modality revenue growth in the first quarter of 2024 was greater than 15% compared to the first quarter of 2023, and orders were up 8%. While encouraging, these positives were offset by the aforementioned weakness in proteins and capital equipment purchase constraints as reported across the industry. Our expectation is that markets will improve as we go through the year with stronger order trends in the second half, and so revenue guidance range is unchanged for 2024. For the quarter, our overall revenues were down $31 million or 17% year-on-year.\n\ndriven primarily by the $23 million decline in COVID-related revenue. Our base business revenues were down approximately 9% in the first quarter, reflecting the anticipated decline in proteins and partially offset by filtration sales where our ATF business had a very strong quarter. Overall, non-COVID orders were flat year-on-year. Within our franchises, protein orders were down 30% as expected, which was more than offset by an approximate 20% increase in filtration demand. Excluding proteins, orders as reported from our non-COVID filtration, chromatography and analytics franchises were up 7% year-on-year and up 13% when you compare the last six months performance to the prior six-month period. Overall, order dollars are consistent with what we observed in the second half of last year while covering the drop off in proteins.\n\nAt a customer level, pharma orders were in line with Q4 and up greater than 10% year-on-year. CDMO orders were down year-on-year and sequentially. Some of the softness can be attributed to lumpiness in orders from a few of our larger accounts, but it's fair to say that, at this point, we're not seeing a true sticky rebound from CDMOs. The good news here is that when we take a look at the last six months versus the previous six months, both CDMO orders and pharma orders are up about 10%. New modality orders were also strong, up high-single-digits in Q1 versus the corresponding period last year. As noted on our February call, strength in new modalities is directly tied to our top 20 to 25 accounts who are scaling with our technology. Strategically, Q1 was another good quarter for the company.\n\nOur latest acquisition in the fluid management mixing space, Metenova, had a strong quarter for revenues and orders. Our collective teams continue to work through the integration plan with a focus on managing the broader network of distributors and new product development. In fact, we just launched our first bag and film technology into the single-use bag market, paving the way for the launch of our single-use mixers in the second half of this year. In addition, our R&D team successfully developed and launched the industry's first fully automated GMP-ready filtration system called RS10. The feedback at the Interphex earlier this month on these two new product launches was incredibly positive and we expect the system for MRNA and cell and gene therapy processing to have a meaningful contribution in 2024.\n\nWe're clearly executing on our strategy to differentiate ourselves in the market with best-in-class systems and follow-on consumables. Moving now to our quarterly performance. The story of the quarter was the performance of our Filtration and Fluid Management businesses. Our filtration franchise had a very strong quarter with non-COVID revenue growth of more than 10%. As mentioned earlier, this was driven by the success of ATF where we have been specified into nine late stage and commercial processes since mid-2023. The impact of these late stage wins drives more consistency in consumables and should be a key driver of growth for this business over the coming years, especially as many of these drugs are in the ramp up phase. In addition, the Fluid Management business had a good quarter for both revenue and orders.\n\nWe are seeing some very positive signs as our investments in this area are beginning to pay off. In chromatography, our OPUS pre-packed column business had a solid quarter, slightly up on revenue versus Q4. The opportunity funnel is strong and we expect further growth in revenues here in Q2 as this business continues to recover from the resin shortage challenges in prior years. A major driver of growth for us is the continued uptick in OPUS demand in the new modality markets. as more customers switch to the convenience of pre-packed columns versus self-packed. Our analytics business had a slower start to the year, mainly driven by fewer dollars for capital equipment purchases. This is consistent with what we have seen for this franchise over the last few years.\n\nAgain, our funnel of opportunities is strong. There continues to be strong demand for FlowVPX and real-time process management or RPM, and we continue to see these technologies as the drivers of growth for analytics here in 2024. Finally, we had a weak quarter in proteins. Revenues were down both year-on-year and sequentially as Cytiva demand dropped to essentially zero. And as we noted in February, another partner is burning off inventory, which also impacts our performance. The Q1 decline in proteins is in line with our guidance for the year of 30% to 35% drop off in revenues. However, we continue to expect growth in filtration, chromatography and analytics as previously guided. In summary, we're off to a good start here in 2024. We believe that de-stocking is essentially behind us. A technician in a lab inspecting an ELISA test kit for use in biopharmaceutical diagnostics.\n\nWe see positive trends in consumables and our orders are holding steady, staying 2% to 3% ahead of sales over the last nine months. Our guidance is based on our expectation to see orders pick up in the second half of the year. We remain confident in the medium to longer term potential in bioprocessing with stronger growth in view for 2025. With that, I will hand it over to Jason for a financial update.\n\nJason Garland : Thank you, Tony. And good morning, everyone. Today, we reported our financial results for the first quarter 2024 and left adjusted financial guidance unchanged for full year 2024. Revenue in the first quarter was down $4 million sequentially from a strong fourth quarter, driven primarily by the expected headwind from proteins on lower affinity ligands and resin demand. We delivered total revenue of $151 million in the quarter. This is a reported decline of 17% year-over-year or down 20% on an organic basis, with acquisitions contributing 3% of our reported growth and currency with nearly a 1% headwind. As Tony mentioned, for the quarter, our base business, which excludes COVID revenue and M&A, was down 9% on lower protein sales.\n\nWe recognized $23 million of COVID revenue in the first quarter of 2023 and approximately $6 million in M&A sales in the first quarter of 2024 from our 2023 acquisitions. Therefore, our base sales were $145 million in the first quarter versus $160 million in the prior year. Tony shared color on our franchise performance, so let me quickly highlight the performance across our global regions. For context, in the first quarter of 2024, North America represented approximately 49% of our global business, while Europe and Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world represented 33% and 18%, respectively. For our non-COVID business in the first quarter, North America was up on strength across all franchises except proteins, and Europe was slightly down with the decline in ligands being offset by strength in Filtration.\n\nThe decline in Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world was driven by continued weakness in China. First quarter 2024 adjusted gross profit was $74 million, a 27% decrease year-over-year, while delivering a 48.6% adjusted gross margin on $31 million of lower revenue. The year-over-year reduction in gross margin of over 6 points reflects roughly 4.5 points of mix headwind from the high COVID sales in the first quarter of last year with the remainder tied to reduced volume. Our gross margin remained roughly consistent with our fourth quarter 2023 exit rate, down about 50 basis points on slightly lower volume, and consistent with achieving our 2024 total year guidance of 49% to 50%. As we have shared before, we remain focused on cost management and ensuring we have the right balance of resources.\n\nWe continue to execute restructuring actions and will remain diligent in our spending, investment prioritization and we remain focused on driving productivity and efficiency across our manufacturing network. As an update, we incurred just over $1 million of restructuring charges in the first quarter, down from the $8 million of charges in the fourth quarter. This was mostly driven by severance and facility exit costs. All these charges are non-recurring in nature and are only reflected in our gap P&L for all periods. So our current restructuring plans are coming to an end. We will evaluate the need for future discrete actions as we continue our margin expansion journey. Continuing through the P&L, our adjusted income from operations was $12 million in the first quarter, down $29 million compared to prior year, driven by the $27 million drop in adjusted gross profit just described, with an additional $3 million increase in adjusted SG&A and a $1 million decrease in adjusted R&D as we manage the timing of our technology investments, while continuing to introduce innovative new products.\n\nThe increase in adjusted SG&A is driven by $2 million from both our acquisitions that closed after the first quarter of 2023. SG&A is also impacted by the annual increase of salaries. Sequentially, OpEx was up $4 million in the first quarter of 2024 versus the fourth quarter of 2023. This also includes the impact of annual salary increases, higher stock-based comp, and the timing of external services. In the fourth quarter, stock comp benefited from grants dissolving with employee exits, which did not repeat and, in fact, was offset by new grants in the first quarter. Our first quarter 2024 operating income margin of roughly 8% includes about a 5-point headwind from depreciation, which had been a 4-point headwind in the same 2023 period. This is reflective of the critical investments we have made in capacity.\n\nYear-over-year, operating income margin is primarily driven by roughly 9 points of negative mix at the operating margin level from COVID sales last year and about a 7-point drag from volume deleveraging on OpEx and our fixed capacity structure with the lower sales. Both of these are partially offset by nearly 2 points of net year-over-year cost initiative benefits. Our first quarter 2024 EBITDA margin rate was approximately 13%, which excludes the drag of the increased depreciation. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $16 million, down $20 million versus last year. This was driven by the $29 million drop in adjusted operating income, offset by $2 million of higher interest income, net of interest expense from improved interest rates on our cash position, and approximately $6 million less tax provision.\n\nOur first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 18.7%. While the rate in the quarter includes a discrete benefit from stock-based compensation, the total year adjusted effective tax rate is still on track for 21% as guided in February. Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.28 compared to $0.64 in the same period in 2023. Finally, with a strong generation of cash flow from operations in the quarter, we increased our cash position to $781 million, up $29 million from the end of 2023. I'll now move to a quick update on our guidance for the full year of 2024. I'll speak to adjusted financial guidance, but please note that our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for our 2024 guidance are included in the reconciliation tables in today's earning press release.\n\nAnd for further clarity, our guidance is fully inclusive of the FlexBiosys and Metenova acquisitions we made in 2023. In summary, we have made no changes to the total year adjusted guidance ranges that we shared in February. Running quickly through the P&L, our revenue for 2024 is expected to be in the range of $620 million to $650 million, while we continue to manage three key headwinds \u2013 COVID, proteins, and China. We expect 2% to 7% growth for our non-COVID business, with M&A contributing 3 points of that growth. As a note, we will not be reporting on COVID sales in 2024 as this will be de minimis. We expect revenues in the first half of 2024 to be better than the second half of 2023 and we expect revenue for the second half of 2024 to step higher again.\n\nWe expect to deliver adjusted gross margins in the range of 49% to 50%, essentially flat to 2023. As summarized, in February, we see about 200 basis points of headwind from mix with our reduced proteins forecast, salary increases, material inflation, and from resetting our incentive compensation back to normal levels for our employees in 2024, after being far below that in 2023. The impact from these headwinds is expected to be entirely offset by the manufacturing productivity, which is forecasted to generate roughly 200 basis points of year-over-year adjusted gross margin rate improvement. We still assume price will be flat for the year, though we will raise prices selectively. We expect our adjusted income from operations to be between $83 million to $88 million, or 13% to 14% adjusted operating margin rate, which is down about 100 basis points at our midpoint versus 2023.\n\nIn our adjusted income from operations, we see line of sight to delivering 400 basis points of year-over-year productivity. However, total salary increases, material inflation, mix from lower protein sales, and volume deleverage creates greater than 300 basis points of headwind. And the headwind from resetting our incentive compensation is a total of approximately 200 basis points of headwind at the adjusted income from operations level, with the majority of our incentive costs in SG&A. As discussed earlier, we remain focused on optimizing our cost structure while protecting the resources and investments needed to grow long term. As our volume grows, we expect profitability to grow with it. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be in the range of 18% to 19% for the year, reflective of the exclusion of roughly 500 basis points of headwind from fixed depreciation costs from the critical capacity expansions we have made.\n\nContinuing through the P&L, we expect our adjusted other income to be between $18 million and $19 million. We will continue to monitor the progression of interest rates and update this outlook as appropriate through the year. Our 2024 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be an estimated 21%. Incorporating all of these items, we expect our adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.42 and $1.49, down $0.33 to $0.26 respectively versus last year. As we wrap up, let me state that we will remain laser focused on the execution of our strategic priorities, continuing to expand our position in top accounts, delivering more innovation with differentiated new products, building off our wins in new modalities, successfully integrating Metenova, and remaining diligent on our cost control and productivity to support increase in margins as we go through the year.\n\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open the lines for questions.\n\nSee also\n\n25 States with Highest Mortgage Delinquency Rates and\n\n11 Oversold Growth Stocks to Buy Right Now.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

The company had recorded adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.\n\nTotal revenues were $151.3 million, down 17.2% year over year on a reported basis and 20% organically.\u00a0 Revenues, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $150 million.\n\nThe year-over-year decrease in total revenues can be attributed to the absence of COVID-related revenues and the expected decrease in revenues from protein franchisees.\n\nShares of Repligen have declined 11.9% so far this year compared with the industry\u2019s 10.5% decline. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQuarter in Detail\n\nThe company reported product revenues of $151.3 million, down 17.1% from the year-ago period. It also reported royalty and other revenues of $0.04 million, almost flat year over year.\n\nRepligen\u2019s base business revenues of $145 million declined 9.4% year over year, owing to the anticipated decline in revenues from proteins business on lower affinity ligands and resin demand.\n\nThe company\u2019s base business can be categorized under four franchises \u2014 filtration, chromatography, protein and process analytics.\n\nRevenues from the chromatography business improved slightly on a sequential basis. RGEN expects revenues to improve further in the second quarter as the chromatography business continues to recover from the resin shortage challenges.\n\nThe filtration franchise\u2019s sales grew more than 10% year over year, while non-COVID filtration revenue grew more than 15% on a sequential basis, driven by the success of ATF.\n\nRevenues in the protein franchise declined both year-on-year and on a sequential basis as demand for Cytiva dropped to almost nil. The decline in protein revenues was in line with the company\u2019s guidance of a 30% to 35% decline in revenues for 2024.\n\nThough the analytics business had a slow start in the first quarter, RGEN continues to see strong demand for FlowVPX and real-time process management or RPM, which is the growth driving factor for this business unit.\n\nRevenues from the company\u2019s new modalities business, which includes cell and gene therapy and mRNA, were up more than 15% year on year in the reported quarter.\n\nNewly acquired, Metenova generated revenues of more than $5 million in the first quarter of 2024, in line with management\u2019s expectations.\n\nAdjusted gross margin was 48.6% in the first quarter, down 60 basis points year over year.\n\nAdjusted research and development expenses totaled approximately $11 million, down almost 9.8% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $50.8 million, up 6.3% year over year.\n\nAdjusted operating income totaled $11.8 million, down almost 71% from the prior year quarter.\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, Repligen had cash and cash equivalents worth $780.6 million compared with $751.3 million as of Dec 31, 2023.\n\n2024 Guidance\n\nOn the first-quarter conference call, management stated that it expects revenues in the first half of 2024 to be better than the second half of 2023.\n\nRepligen reiterated the guidance it had provided earlier this year. The company expects total revenues in the range of $620-$650 million for 2024. Adjusted EPS is anticipated to be between $1.42 and $1.49 in 2024.\n\nThe company anticipates base business revenues to be down 1% to up 4% in 2024.\n\nAdjusted net income is estimated in the band of $80-$84 million. Adjusted operating income is anticipated in the $83-$88 million range.\n\nRepligen expects an adjusted gross margin in the 49%-50% range.

Net Income: Adjusted net income for Q1 2024 was $16 million, down $20 million from the previous year.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with RGEN.\n\nRelease Date: May 01, 2024\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nRepligen Corp (NASDAQ:RGEN) reported solid Q1 revenue of $151 million, aligning with expectations and maintaining guidance for the first half of 2024. Non-COVID Filtration orders increased by 20% year-on-year in Q1, with revenue up by more than 10%, indicating strong demand in this segment. Consumable orders showed a positive uptick, increasing by more than 10% both sequentially and year-on-year, suggesting recovery from previous destocking challenges. New modality revenue grew by over 15% compared to Q1 2023, with orders up 8%, highlighting growth in this innovative sector. Successful launch of new products like the fully automated GMP-ready filtration system RS10, and positive feedback at industry conferences, enhancing product portfolio and market competitiveness.\n\nNegative Points\n\nOverall Q1 revenues were down $31 million or 17% year-on-year, primarily due to a $23 million decline in COVID-related revenue. Protein orders decreased by 30% as anticipated, continuing to pose significant challenges to revenue streams. CDMO orders were down both year-on-year and sequentially, indicating ongoing volatility and lack of a stable rebound in this customer segment. Weakness in capital equipment purchases across the industry, reflecting broader market hesitations. Continued market challenges in China, contributing to regional revenue declines and impacting overall performance.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Can you discuss the trends in China, particularly in relation to the BIOSECURE Act and CDMO market dynamics? A: (Anthony J. Hunt, CEO & Director) The CDMO market in China showed positive order trends in Q4 but did not repeat in Q1, indicating ongoing weakness. Pharma has been more positive. The BIOSECURE Act's impact is still uncertain, and we are closely monitoring how it will be implemented and its effects on our operations and customer interactions.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ: Could you elaborate on the 30% decline in Protein orders this quarter and the expected trend for the rest of the year? A: (Anthony J. Hunt, CEO & Director) The 30% decline in Protein orders aligns with our expectations set in February. We anticipate this trend to continue throughout the year, maintaining a 30% to 35% decline by year-end.\n\nQ: How did orders trend throughout the quarter, and what are the expectations for order pickup in the latter half of the year? A: (Anthony J. Hunt, CEO & Director) January was lighter, with stronger performance in February and March. April orders were as expected. For achieving our second-half targets, we anticipate a need for order pickup in Q2 and Q3. Positive signs include consumable trends, although challenges remain with CDMO market rebound and capital equipment demand.\n\nQ: What are the current challenges and expectations around the CDMO market's recovery? A: (Anthony J. Hunt, CEO & Director) The CDMO market exhibits lumpiness, particularly in top accounts, affecting order consistency. However, orders from CDMOs have shown a 10% increase over the last six months compared to the previous period. The market's full recovery is still pending, and we are closely watching potential impacts from recent industry acquisitions and regulatory changes.\n\nQ: Can you discuss the Chromatography business recovery from resin shortages and expectations for growth this year? A: (Anthony J. Hunt, CEO & Director) The resin supply issue is resolved, with capacity and lead times back to pre-COVID levels. The Chromatography business is expected to grow 0% to 5% this year, influenced by pharma and CDMO dynamics. Growth in new modalities and potential upticks in CDMO orders could push growth towards the higher end of our forecast.\n\nQ: What are the margin impacts from the Protein business and other mix changes this quarter? A: (Jason K. Garland, CFO & Chief Compliance Officer) Protein margins are above average, but the significant impact this quarter came from high-margin COVID sales in the previous year. The mix changes, including lower equipment sales and stronger consumables, also influenced the gross margins.\n\nThese Q&A highlights from Repligen's earnings call provide insights into the company's operational challenges and strategies, particularly in relation to market dynamics in China, the performance of the Protein segment, and expectations for the Chromatography business.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Repligen (RGEN) Misses Q1 Earnings Estimates",
        "content": "Repligen (RGEN) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.28 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.29 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.64 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -3.45%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this drug developer would post earnings of $0.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.33, delivering a surprise of -2.94%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nRepligen , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, posted revenues of $151.35 million for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.11%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $182.66 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nRepligen shares have lost about 8.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 5.6%.\n\nWhat's Next for Repligen?\n\nWhile Repligen has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Repligen: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.33 on $153.88 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.46 on $636.56 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Biomedical and Genetics is currently in the top 29% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Ultragenyx (RARE), has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024. The results are expected to be released on May 2.\n\nThis biotechnology company is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.72 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +26.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nUltragenyx's revenues are expected to be $114.39 million, up 13.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We also saw continued strength from new modality customers who are scaling up with our technologies.

For more information about the company see our website at www.repligen.com, and follow us on LinkedIn.\n\nNon-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance To supplement our financial statements, which are presented on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the following Adjusted (non-GAAP) measures of financial performance are included in this release: book-to-bill ratios, base business revenue growth, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin; adjusted cost of goods sold; adjusted R&D expense; adjusted SG&A expense; adjusted pre-tax income; adjusted income from operations; adjusted net income; adjusted earnings per share-diluted; adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and adjusted EBITDA margin. The Company provides base revenue and base revenue growth rates, which exclude COVID-related revenue, and the impact of acquisition revenue for current year periods that have no prior year comparables, to facilitate a comparison of its current revenue performance. The Company provides the impact of foreign currency translation, to enable determination of revenue growth rates at constant currency, which exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, in order to facilitate a comparison of its current revenue performance to its past revenue performance. To calculate the impact of foreign currency translation, the Company converts actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period.\n\nThe Company\u2019s non-GAAP financial results and/or non-GAAP guidance exclude the impact of: acquisition and integration costs; restructuring charges including the costs of severance; inventory adjustments and accelerated depreciation among other charges; contingent consideration related to the Company\u2019s acquisitions; intangible amortization costs; non-cash interest expense related to the accretion of the debt discount; amortization of debt issuance costs related to Company\u2019s convertible debt; foreign currency impact of certain intercompany loans; and, the related impact on tax of non-GAAP charges. These costs are excluded because management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, nor do the resulting charges recorded accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recorded.\n\nNOTE:\r\nAll reconciliations of above GAAP figures (reported or guidance) to adjusted (non-GAAP) figures are detailed in the tables included later in this press release. When analyzing the Company\u2019s operating performance and guidance, investors should not consider non-GAAP measures as a substitute for the comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nForward-Looking Statement This release contains forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to and in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws, including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Repligen has a strong track record of smart acquisitions and innovation, including the introduction of differentiated filters and development of in-line process analytics (real-time monitoring of the drug production process).

        "content": "Investors interested in stocks from the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics sector have probably already heard of Puma Biotech (PBYI) and Repligen (RGEN). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\n\nThere are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\n\nPuma Biotech has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Repligen has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that PBYI's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\n\nValue investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nPBYI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.35, while RGEN has a forward P/E of 129.33. We also note that PBYI has a PEG ratio of 1.36. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. RGEN currently has a PEG ratio of 6.16.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for PBYI is its P/B ratio of 5.24. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, RGEN has a P/B of 5.54.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help PBYI earn a Value grade of A, while RGEN has been given a Value grade of D.\n\nStory continues\n\nPBYI sticks out from RGEN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that PBYI is the better option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Repligen fair value estimate is US$189 Repligen's US$197 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Analyst price target for RGEN is US$211, which is 12% above our fair value estimate\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Repligen Corporation (NASDAQ:RGEN) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Repligen\n\nThe Model\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\nStory continues\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$62.7m US$109.4m US$150.6m US$273.4m US$370.0m US$443.9m US$509.1m US$564.9m US$612.1m US$652.1m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x4 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 19.99% Est @ 14.68% Est @ 10.96% Est @ 8.36% Est @ 6.54% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6%  US$58.8 US$96.3 US$124 US$212 US$269 US$302 US$325 US$338 US$344 US$344\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.4b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.6%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$652m\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (6.6%\u2013 2.3%) = US$15b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$15b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$8.1b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$11b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$197, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Repligen as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.941. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Repligen\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nExpensive based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nThreat\n\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

        "content": "Repligen Corp stands as a key player in the bioprocessing industry, with a diverse product portfolio and global reach. The company's strategic acquisitions and commitment to innovation have positioned it to capitalize on the growing biologics market. Repligen's financial health, as reflected in its SEC filings, showcases robust revenue streams and a strong market presence. Despite its strengths, Repligen faces challenges such as intense competition, reliance on key customers, and the need to continuously innovate.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with PRU.\n\nOn February 22, 2024, Repligen Corp (NASDAQ:RGEN), a global life sciences company, filed its 10-K report with the SEC, offering a comprehensive view of its financial health and strategic positioning. As a leader in bioprocessing technologies and systems, Repligen has demonstrated a commitment to innovation and efficiency in biological drug manufacturing. With a market capitalization of approximately $6.93 billion as of June 30, 2023, and a workforce of 1,783 employees, the company has established a strong foothold in the industry. The financial tables within the filing reveal a company that has successfully navigated the complexities of the bioprocessing market, generating significant revenue across North America, Europe, and Asia. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that shape Repligen's operational and financial landscape. Decoding Repligen Corp (RGEN): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nRobust Product Portfolio and Innovation: Repligen Corp (NASDAQ:RGEN) has cultivated a diverse and innovative product portfolio, which includes filtration, chromatography, process analytics, and proteins. The company's strategic focus on R&D has led to the development of high-value bioprocessing products that address specific challenges in the biologics manufacturing process. With at least 263 active patent grants and 369 pending patent applications, Repligen's intellectual property portfolio is a testament to its commitment to innovation and market leadership. The company's ability to consistently introduce disruptive new products has solidified its reputation as an innovation leader in bioprocessing.\n\nStory continues\n\nGlobal Commercial Presence: Repligen's commercial organization has expanded significantly, boasting a team of 342 employees as of December 31, 2023. This includes a specialized sales force with expertise in key bioprocessing areas, supported by technically trained field applications specialists and field service providers. The company's direct commercial organization in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, along with strategic partners in select markets, enables effective penetration and expansion in the bioprocessing products market. Repligen's global reach and commercial strength are critical drivers of its revenue growth and market share.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on Key Customers and Suppliers: Despite a diversified client base, Repligen Corp (NASDAQ:RGEN) has historically relied on a limited number of large customers for a significant portion of its revenues. The loss or reduction of orders from these customers could substantially impact the company's financial performance. Additionally, Repligen's reliance on a limited number of suppliers, and in some cases, a single supplier for certain products, presents a risk to its supply chain. Any disruption or inability to find replacements or transition to alternative suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition and reputation.\n\nCompetitive Market Pressures: The bioprocessing market is intensely competitive, with several large and well-capitalized companies such as Danaher Corporation, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., MilliporeSigma, and Sartorius vying for market share. These competitors may have greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, and R&D resources, which could enable them to market their products at lower prices or on more advantageous terms to customers. Repligen must continuously innovate and maintain cost competitiveness to mitigate the risk of reduced gross margins and loss of market share.\n\nOpportunities\n\nExpansion in Biologics Market: The global market for biologics continues to grow, presenting significant opportunities for Repligen Corp (NASDAQ:RGEN) to expand its customer base and increase market penetration. The company's comprehensive suite of products for both upstream and downstream processes in biological drug manufacturing positions it well to capitalize on this growth. Repligen's ongoing investment in innovation and its strategic acquisitions align with the industry's evolving needs, potentially leading to increased adoption of its technologies and systems.\n\nStrategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: Repligen has a history of successful strategic partnerships and acquisitions that have expanded its product offerings and technological capabilities. The company's collaborations with large life sciences companies, such as Cytiva, MilliporeSigma, and Purolite, through distributor and supply agreements, enhance its market presence and provide avenues for growth. Continued focus on strategic partnerships and targeted acquisitions could further strengthen Repligen's competitive position and drive long-term growth.\n\nThreats\n\nTechnological Advancements by Competitors: Repligen Corp (NASDAQ:RGEN) operates in a market characterized by rapid technological advancements. Competitors may develop new products or approaches that could render Repligen's offerings obsolete or noncompetitive. The company must maintain a strong pipeline of innovative products and adapt to changing market dynamics to mitigate the risk of technological obsolescence.\n\nGlobal Economic and Regulatory Challenges: Repligen's operations and performance could be affected by various global challenges, including natural disasters, geopolitical unrest, public health issues, and regulatory changes. The ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Palestine, as well as potential changes in climate change-related regulation, could disrupt the supply, delivery, or demand for products. Additionally, cyber-attacks or security breaches could result in material disruptions to product development programs. Repligen must remain vigilant and proactive in managing these risks to ensure business continuity and\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Now I'll turn the call over to Tony Hunt.\n\nAnthony Hunt: Thank you, Sondra. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our 2023 fourth quarter and year-end report. In addition to reporting out on our financial results today, the key objective for this call is to provide insight into how we see 2024 playing out for Repligen and the pacing of revenue as we go through the year. Having had a few months to reflect on our Q4 results, in 2023 in general, we believe we are seeing some clear indicators that our markets are beginning to turn in a positive direction, especially given the strength in orders coming out of last year. This will help drive growth for the company, especially as we move into the second half of 2024. As we all know, 2023 was a challenging year for Repligen in the bioprocessing industry.\n\nThe first half of the year saw elevated stock levels at both CDMO and pharma accounts, conservative capital spending and project delays at pharma companies and the deterioration in China where orders dropped off rapidly and new opportunities for products declined. In the second half of the year, we started to see some positive signs of recovery. We aren't ready to call a full recovery yet but there is good reason for optimism. We see 4 indicators for Repligen; opportunity funnel growth, improving pharma ordering patterns, early indications of CDMO recovery and overall book-to-bill strength. So let's start with our opportunity funnel. Our sales funnel improved in 2023 with our 50% and above opportunities up more than 50% compared to the start of the year.\n\nThis is an important metric that we believe reflects the likelihood of customers placing orders in the near term. We also saw a rebound in pharma demand, especially in Q3, where pharma orders were up 50% versus prior quarter. We finished the year with second half pharma orders up greater than 30% versus H1. The CDMO market has also improved in the second half of 2023 with orders up more than 25% in Q4 versus Q3 and up more than 20% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Again, some positive signs from more customers for the first time since the first half of 2022. Overall, our book-to-bill improved in the second half of the year, coming in at 1.07 in Q3 and 1.03 in Q4. Our Filtration franchise also had a positive book-to-bill in both Q3 and Q4 at 1.15 and 1.03, respectively.\n\nEx-COVID, the Filtration book-to-bill was 1.13 in Q4. So 2 strong quarters in a row of orders largest and most impacted by COVID franchise. When I look at the full year, I was also very pleased with the way the Repligen team executed, staying focused on the key goals we set for ourselves at the beginning of 2023, namely: one, we want to make further inroads into new modalities; two, we wanted to strategically manage key accounts to accelerate adoption of our technologies, especially in our top pharma and CDMO accounts; three, we wanted to launch new products with a focus on advanced Analytics, systems and Filtration; and four, we wanted to rebalance the organization to address margin challenges. First, on new modality inroads. Our new modalities business, which covers cell and gene therapy and mRNA continues to gain ground.\n\nDriven by several late stage and commercial wins in 2023, new modality revenues in the fourth quarter were up 9% year-on-year. For the full year, new modalities represented 18% of total revenues and while up only slightly versus 2022, the results are still impressive in light of the double-digit decline in sales across our industry. On the orders front, new modality accounts were up more than 10% in the second half of 2023 versus the first half of the year and up greater than 15% for the full year compared to 2022. The order strength was driven by Chrom, Filtration and Analytics franchises with notable product line strength from OPUS, Fluid Management assemblies and ARTeSYN systems. We also added more than 85 new accounts in 2023. So we're really encouraged by our position and differentiation in this important market.\n\nNext, on managing key accounts. A key objective for us in 2023 was to build out a key account program and team to drive growth at our top pharma and CDMO accounts. With the key accounts team in place by midyear, we were able to focus this group on improving our portfolio visibility. In 2023, orders from our top 10 pharma accounts were up 50% from the second half of 2023 compared to H1 and 20% for the full year compared to 2022. Of our top 10 CDMO accounts, orders in the second half of 2023 were flat versus H1, but up nearly 15% when compared to full year 2022. Again, directionally positive signs that our top accounts are beginning to show growth momentum. Moving now to new product launches and adoption. Each year, it's been our goal to launch 8 to 10 new products.\n\nAnd in 2023, we launched 10. Although these were first year [indiscernible] product offerings, they generated over $12 million in revenue in 2023. So despite the year's challenges, we're really proud of our innovation track record. In 2023, 13% of our total revenue came from products launched between 2021 through the end of 2023. In the fourth quarter alone, that number was 16%. This past year, the success of our new products was in 3 areas. The first was RPM, where our Analytics customers are seeing the benefits of real-time process monitoring. Second was our ARTeSYN RS systems where we have a market-leading single-use system portfolio. And third was ATR, where the new XCell controllers are doing well in the marketplace and providing value in the from of more automation and control for our process intensification customers.\n\nAnd finally, regarding rebalancing resources. Our entire team from top to bottom focused on cost containment and the leadership team rolled out programs to rightsize our organization. Through this difficult but prudent process, we reduced our workforce by more than 15%. We are consolidating facilities, merging 3 of our facilities into sister plants. We are adjusting inventories and we are controlling expenses. By year-end, we were back to nearly 50% gross margin for the company. We expect to be complete our rebalancing and streamlining activities by the end of Q2. And from there, we anticipate that margins will improve as our volumes improve over the next few years. So moving now to our Q4 business results. As you saw in our press release this morning, we delivered $156 million in revenue with our base business, which excludes COVID and M&A, up 1% sequentially, down 13% year-on-year and down 9% for the full year.\n\nBase revenue highlights in the fourth quarter included modest year-over-year growth and nice sequential growth for both our Analytics and Protein franchises, as well as the aforementioned positive impact from new modality accounts. At a customer level, our non-COVID Q4 pharma revenues which includes M&A were flat year-on-year. For CDMOs and integrators, Q4 revenues were down 20% and 10%, respectively, compared to Q4 of 2022. Metenova came in right on track at $5 million of revenues in Q4. The team continues to work through the early phases of integration. We are happy with the progress we are making and expect to further integrate Metenova mixing solutions into our Fluid Management portfolio as we go through the year. Moving to orders. Base business orders for the fourth quarter were up 3% year-over-year.\n\nNon-COVID orders for the fourth quarter were up 6% year-over-year. From a customer perspective non-COVID pharma and integrated orders were flat year-on-year, but CDMOs were up greater than 20%, both year-on-year sequentially. The order performance in Q4 is very encouraged, especially at CDMO accounts where we are starting to see some early signs of recovery. Moving now to franchise-level business highlights. In Chromatography, our year-over-year revenues were down approximately 25% in the fourth quarter and down 4% for the full year. The fourth quarter decline was primarily driven by the higher mix of columns versus resin demand. On orders, Chrom was down 4% for the quarter and for the full year 2023. The opportunity for our OPUS product lines continues to increase.\n\nAnd for 2024, we expect Chromatography revenue growth in the range of 0% to 5%. In Protein, our year-over-year revenues were up 7% in the fourth quarter and down 9% for the full year. Our Protein franchise had a solid revenue and orders quarter driven by growth factors and Custom Affinity Resins. That said, we expect weak demand for Protein in 2024, reflecting the Cytiva drop-off of approximately $10 million and lower forecast for ligands from our other customers, including the discontinuation and ramp-down of some legacy resins by one of our partners. This is the one franchise where we see excess finished goods inventory in the channel, and we think it will take 2024 for this to reverse. As our Protein forecast in 2024 will be down 30% to 35%, we expect the Protein business to have a strong bounce-back year in 2025 as new products targeting antibody and antibody fragment purification gained traction.\n\nWe have built a market-leading set of ligands over the last 2 years, firmly establishing ourselves as the technology leader in this space, and we will be working closely with Purolite to drive market adoption for these products. In Filtration, our year-over-year revenues were down approximately 20% in the fourth quarter and 30% for the full year. The declines were driven by the drop-off in COVID-related revenue, which was approximately $23 million in Q4 of 2022 compared to $8 million in Q4 of 2023. Filtration orders in Q4 were again strong with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.03. Excluding COVID contributions in Q4, our Filtration book-to-bill was 1.13 driven by strong demand for XCell ATF, ARTeSYN systems and Fluid Management assemblies. With a strengthening order book, our expectation in 2024 is that this franchise will be up 10% to 15% on our base business or 5% to 10% on a reported basis.\n\nFinally, our year-over-year Analytics business was up 2% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and up 6% for the full year. We're seeing solid orders for Analytics, which were up 10% for the year. The Analytics story of the quarter and the year was the strong traction for our FlowVPX and our RPM product lines and the continued adoption of VPE technology by new modality accounts. As the markets pick up, we expect the Analytics business to grow 10% to 15% in 2024. In summary, despite the headwinds in Proteins, our other 3 franchises combined, are showing solid growth potential in 2024, projected to be up 9% on base business and 6% as reported at the midpoint of our guidance. So what do we expect to see as we move through the year? As we have repeatedly stated over the last 6 months, we see 2024 as a transition year for the company and the industry, and we don't expect a full recovery until the second half of this year. A technician in a lab inspecting an ELISA test kit for use in biopharmaceutical diagnostics.\n\nWe do expect revenues in the first half of 2024 to be modestly better than the second half of 2023. We believe the strength we've seen in orders over the last 6 months supports our ability to reach our 2024 revenue targets, including $300 million in the first half. We expect stronger revenues and orders in the second half of the year with revenues in H2 projects to be up 10% to 15% over H1 or $335 million at the midpoint of our guidance. All in, our guidance for 2024 is in the range of $620 million to $650 million, up 2% to 7% for non-COVID business with M&A contributing 3 points of growth. We also expect that we will return to double-digit revenue growth for our businesses in 2025. We believe that the increased emphasis we've placed on commercial execution is really helping to reshape and expand our opportunity funnel.\n\nThe stronger funnel, combined with our investment in the key account management team along with an improving book-to-bill environment provides some real momentum as we head into 2024. As we move through the year, our strategic priorities will center on the following. Number one is to further expand our opportunity funnel and strengthen our order position on top accounts. Two, is around launching new products with a focus on Fluid Management and integrated PAT systems. Three, is around building up our wins in new modality markets. Four, is around successfully integrating Metenova into Repligen and launching a portfolio of mixing solutions in the marketplace. And finally five, is around controlling our costs and increasing our margins as we go through the year.\n\nIn summary, we are happy to be moving forward here in 2024. We have the right team and expertise in place across all aspects of our business from operations to finance to commercial. We'll continue to focus on bringing flexibility and efficiency to bioprocessing through internal R&D and M&A. We've entered 2024 with a stronger balance sheet and a care plan for delivering long-term reward for our shareholders. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jason for the reports on our financial performance.\n\nJason Garland: Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 and provided financial guidance for 2024. As we expected, revenue in the fourth quarter stepped up nearly [indiscernible] million over third quarter low point. We delivered total revenue of $156 million, with approximately $8 million of COVID sales in the quarter. This is a reported decline of 17% for the fourth quarter or down 21% on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency fluctuations. Our total year 2023 revenue was $639 million, aligned with our October guidance. This was a year-over-year decrease of 20% as reported and down 21% on an organic basis.\n\nFX provided a slight tailwind in the quarter. And for the total year, FX had a negligible impact of less than 30 basis points of growth headwind. For the total year, our base business, which excludes COVID revenue and M&A, was down 9% on a reported basis. We recognized $32 million of COVID revenue and approximately $7 million in M&A sales from our FlexBiosys and Metenova acquisition. Therefore, our base sales were $599 million. Included in the $599 million is just over $10 million of ligand sales to Cytiva which will be negligible in 2024. Tony shared the revenue performance of our franchises, but let me highlight the revenue performance across our global regions. For context, the total year 2023, North America represented approximately 44% of our global business, while Europe and Asia Pacific and the rest of the world represented 37% and 19%, respectively.\n\nThe challenges of the year were global in nature, and we saw declines across all regions, but Europe demonstrated the most positive momentum in the quarter. Year-over-year, on a reported basis, sales declined in North America by 20% for the fourth quarter and by 19% for the total year 2023. Europe was flat for the quarter, but down 19% for the year. And Asia Pacific was down 35% for the quarter and down 26% for the total year. China remained as the most significant driver of the region's decline, down 62% in the fourth quarter and down 41% for the total year 2023. Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted gross profit was $77 million, a 20% decrease year-over-year and nearly $31 million of lower revenue, delivering a 49.1% adjusted gross margin. Though still down about 2 percentage points versus the fourth quarter of 2022, this was a 700 basis point increase from the third quarter.\n\nThis increase was driven by approximately 300 basis points from our lower level of inventory adjustments in the third quarter, 200 basis points from positive mix from higher Protein and COVID Filtration sales, 200 basis points from improved labor and overhead efficiencies and higher leverage on depreciation and capacity costs. With this fourth quarter, adjusted gross margin [indiscernible], total year gross margin was 49.5%. This is down 750 basis points from 2022 and $163 million of less revenue. As Tony shared earlier, we have remained focused on cost management and rebalancing our resources through the second half of 2023. The majority of our restructuring actions will be complete within the first half of 2024, but we will remain diligent on our spending, investment prioritization and we will remain focused on driving productivity and efficiencies across our manufacturing network.\n\nThat said, for 2024, we expect our gross margin to remain at the 49% to 50% level. We believe we are turning the corner on profitability based on the actions we have taken in 2023 and will continue to take in 2024, coupled with higher leverage on increasing volumes going forward. Related to our actions, we incurred $8 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter, down from $24 million of charges in the third quarter. This was mostly driven by noncash charges related to inventory revaluation and facility consolidations. All of these charges are nonrecurring in nature and are reflected only in our GAAP P&L in the fourth quarter and total year. Though our current restructuring activities are primarily complete, we evaluate the need for future discrete actions as we continue our margin expansion journey.\n\nContinuing through the P&L, our adjusted operating income was $19 million in the fourth quarter, down $22 million compared to the prior year. This is driven by the $20 million drop in adjusted gross profit just described with only a slight increase in SG&A from our investment in our sales organization. Total year 2023 adjusted operating income was $94 million, down 59% on lower sales and gross margin, offset by a nearly $3 million year-over-year reduction in total operating expenses. Total year adjusted SG&A was down 1% on a reported basis and adjusted R&D spend which is slightly down year-over-year as we essentially held our investments in technology development flat, while continuing to introduce innovative new products. Our total year 2023 operating income margin of 14.8% includes about a 5-point headwind from depreciation, which was only a 3-point headwind in 2022.\n\nThis is reflective of the critical investments we have made in our capacity. For total year 2023, EBITDA margin rate was 20% and more reflective of our profitability excluding the impact of the increased depreciation. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $19 million, down $20 million versus last year. Total year adjusted net income was $98 million, down $90 million. This was driven by $138 million drop in adjusted operating income, and that drop was offset by just over $25 million of higher interest income, net of interest expense from our improved interest rates on our cash position and approximately $20 million less tax provision. Our total year adjusted effective tax rate was 16.2%. This tax rate benefited from the efficient use of cash in our Swedish operation related to the funding of our Metenova acquisition in the third quarter and from stock-based compensation.\n\nWe have not assumed a repeat of these benefits in 2024. Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.33 compared to $0.68 in the same period in 2022. Consistent with our October guidance, our total year adjusted fully diluted EPS was $1.75, a year-over-year decline of 47%. Finally, with operating cash flow generation and the proceeds from our convertible debt exchange, we ended the quarter with $751 million of cash and cash equivalents. I'll now move to our guidance for total year 2024. I'll speak to adjusted financial guidance. So please note that our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for our 2024 guidance are included in the reconciliation tables in today's earnings press release. And for further clarity, our guidance is fully inclusive of the FlexBiosys and Metenova acquisitions we made in 2023.\n\nAs Tony shared earlier, our revenue for 2024 is expected to be in the range of $620 million to $650 million. We expect 2% to 7% on growth for our non-COVID business with M&A contributing 3 points of that growth. As a note, we will not be reporting on COVID sales in 2024, as this will be de minimis. As Tony shared, we expect revenues in the first half of 2024 to be better than the second half of 2023, and we expect revenue for the second half of '24 to step up again. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to deliver adjusted gross margins in the range of 49% to 50%, essentially flat with 2023. We see about 200 basis points of headwind from mix with our reduced Protein sales forecast, salary increases, material inflation and from resetting our incentive compensation back to normal levels for our employees in 2024 after being far below that in 2023.\n\nThe impact from these headwinds is expected to be entirely offset by the manufacturing productivity, which is forecasted to generate roughly 200 basis points of year-over-year adjusted gross margin improvement. I'll also note that price is assumed to be flat this year though we may raise prices selectively. We expect our adjusted income from operations to be between $83 million to $88 million or 13% to 14% adjusted operating income margin rate, which is down about 100 basis points from our midpoint from 2023. In our adjusted operating income, we see line of sight to delivering 400 basis points of year-over-year productivity. However, total salary increases, material inflation, mix from lower Protein sales and volume deleveraging creates greater than 300 basis points of headwind.\n\nAnd the headwinds from resetting our incentive compensation is a total of 200 basis points of headwind at the adjusted operating income level with the majority of our incentive costs in SG&A. We remain focused on balancing our cost structure, taking immediate actions while protecting the resources and investments needed to grow long term. As our volume grows, we expect profitability to grow with it. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be in the range of 18% to 19% for the year, reflective of the exclusion of roughly 500 basis points of headwind fixed depreciation costs and the critical capacity expansions we have made. Continuing down the P&L, we expect our adjusted other income to be down year-over-year by an estimated $4 million to $5 million.\n\nThis reflects the favorable but higher coupon on our convertible debt, increasing from 0.375% to 1.0%. It also reflects an assumption that interest rates that we earn on our money market cash investments will reduce through the course of 2024 as most forward forecasts indicate a similar profile. Our 2024 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to increase to an estimated 21%. This increase versus 2023 ending rate of 16.2% is driven by the 2023 benefits that I cited earlier and not repeating in 2024 related to the acquisition funding and stock-based compensation. Incorporating all of these items, we expect our adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.42 and $1.49, down 33% to , respectively, versus last year. Approximately half of this reduction is from lower operating income and the other half is from both lower other income and the increased tax rate.\n\nWe've entered 2024 with a stronger balance sheet with $751 million of cash and cash equivalents. We will remain prudent in our spending while maintaining flexible dry powder. Our FX spending is expected to be flat to down 5% versus 2023. After 2023, was cut by more than 50% off of our 2022 peak spend. Now as we wrap, let me reiterate our excitement to move forward in 2024 and our optimism about the bioprocessing market improving through the course of the year. We will remain laser-focused on the execution of our strategic priorities, continuing to expand our position in top accounts, delivering more innovation with differentiated new products, building up our wins in new modalities, successfully integrating Metenova and remaining diligent on our cost control and productivity to support increasing margins as we go through the year.\n\nWith that, I will turn the call back to the operator to open the lines for questions.\n\nSee also 11 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now and 10 Fastest Growing Energy Drink Stocks in the US.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

        "title": "Repligen (RGEN) Lags Q4 Earnings and Revenue Estimates",
        "content": "Repligen (RGEN) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.33 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.34 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.68 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -2.94%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this drug developer would post earnings of $0.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.23, delivering a surprise of 64.29%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nRepligen , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, posted revenues of $155.74 million for the quarter ended December 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.11%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $186.76 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nRepligen shares have added about 11.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 4.3%.\n\nWhat's Next for Repligen?\n\nWhile Repligen has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Repligen: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.38 on $155.22 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.80 on $664.75 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with ALIT. Repligen Corp (RGEN) Reports Decline in 2023 Revenue and Net Income\n\nOn February 21, 2024, Repligen Corp (NASDAQ:RGEN) released its 8-K filing, detailing the company's financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. As a global life sciences company, Repligen is known for its bioprocessing technologies that serve biopharmaceutical companies and contract manufacturers worldwide. Despite a strong order book, the company faced a challenging year with a decline in both revenue and net income.\n\nFinancial Performance Overview\n\nRepligen's total revenue for 2023 was $638.8 million, a significant decrease from $801.5 million in 2022. The company's net income also saw a sharp decline, falling to $41.6 million from $186.0 million in the previous year. Earnings per share on a fully diluted GAAP basis were $0.74 for 2023, down from $3.24 for 2022. The gross margin for 2023 stood at 44.6%, which was lower than the 56.9% reported in 2022.\n\nOperational Challenges and Achievements\n\nDespite the downturn in financial metrics, Repligen's CEO, Tony J. Hunt, highlighted the strength in the company's Filtration and Analytics franchises and the momentum from new modality accounts. The company's book-to-bill ratio remained above 1.0 for the second consecutive quarter, indicating a healthy order intake relative to revenue recognized. However, challenges persisted, particularly in China, where macro factors impacted the market.\n\n2024 Financial Outlook\n\nLooking ahead, Repligen provided financial guidance for 2024, projecting total reported revenue to be between $620 million and $650 million. This guidance reflects the expected impact of businesses acquired in 2023 and excludes the impact of any potential business acquisitions in 2024 and future fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nKey Financial Metrics and Tables\n\nImportant metrics such as gross margin, operating margin, and EBITDA margin were presented, showing a mixed picture of the company's profitability. The GAAP gross margin for Q4 2023 was 43.4%, compared to 51.4% in Q4 2022. The operating (EBIT) margin for the full year 2023 was 8.5%, a decrease from 28.0% in 2022.\n\nRepligen's balance sheet remains strong, with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $751.3 million as of December 31, 2023, up from $623.8 million the previous year. The company's working capital and total assets also increased, indicating a solid financial position despite the year's challenges.\n\nRepligen's commitment to innovation and operational excellence remains steadfast, even as it navigates a complex market environment. Investors and stakeholders will be watching closely to see how the company's strategic initiatives and market conditions evolve in the coming year.\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of Repligen's financial performance and future outlook, interested parties can access the full earnings report and listen to the conference call and webcast hosted by the company.\n\nRepligen Contact: Sondra S.

We are \u201cinspiring advances in bioprocessing\u201d for the customers we serve; primarily biopharmaceutical drug developers and contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) worldwide. Our focus areas are Filtration and Fluid Management, Chromatography, Process Analytics and Proteins. Our corporate headquarters are located in Waltham, Massachusetts, and the majority of our manufacturing sites are in the U.S., with additional key sites in Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden. For more information about the company see our website at www.repligen.com, and follow us on LinkedIn.\n\nNon-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance\n\nTo supplement our financial statements, which are presented on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance are included in this release: book-to-bill ratios, base business revenue growth, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin; adjusted cost of sales; adjusted R&D expense; adjusted SG&A expense; adjusted pre-tax income; adjusted income from operations; adjusted net income; adjusted earnings per share-diluted; adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and adjusted EBITDA margin. The Company provides base revenue and base revenue growth rates, which exclude COVID-related revenue, and the impact of acquisition revenue for current year periods that have no prior year comparables, to facilitate a comparison of its current revenue performance. The Company provides the impact of foreign currency translation, to enable determination of revenue growth rates at constant currency, which exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, in order to facilitate a comparison of its current revenue performance to its past revenue performance. To calculate the impact of foreign currency translation, the Company converts actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period.\n\nThe Company\u2019s non-GAAP financial results and/or non-GAAP guidance exclude the impact of: inventory step-up charges; acquisition and integration costs; restructuring charges including the costs of severance; inventory adjustments and accelerated depreciation among other charges; contingent consideration related to the Company\u2019s acquisitions; intangible amortization costs; loss on extinguishment of debt; non-cash interest expense related to the accretion of the debt discount; amortization of debt issuance costs related to Company\u2019s convertible debt; foreign currency impact of certain intercompany loans; and, the related impact on tax of non-GAAP charges. These costs are excluded because management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, nor do the resulting charges recorded accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recorded.\n\nNOTE:\r\nAll reconciliations of above GAAP figures (reported or guidance) to adjusted (non-GAAP) figures are detailed in the tables included later in this press release. When analyzing the Company\u2019s operating performance and guidance investors should not consider non-GAAP measures as a substitute for the comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nForward-Looking Statement\n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to and in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws, including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Prior to filing the Second Supplemental Indenture on March 4, 2022, the Company had the option to settle the conversion of the 2019 Notes in cash, stock or a combination of the two. Therefore, from January 1, 2022 (the date the Company adopted ASU 2020-06) to March 4, 2022, the Company included 3,474,429 shares in the denominator of the weighted average twelve months ended December 31, 2022 diluted EPS calculation. Subsequent to March 4, 2022, after the Second Supplemental Indenture became effective, the Company irrevocably elected to settle the conversion principal in cash and only the premium in shares of the Company's common stock. Therefore, from March 5, 2022 to March 31, 2022 the Company included 980,525 shares in the denominator of the weighted average twelve months ended December 31, 2022 diluted EPS calculation. Under the if-converted method, the Company was also required to exclude amortization of debt issuance cost and interest charges applicable to the convertible debt from the numerator of the diluted EPS calculation for the period from January 1, 2022 to March 4, 2022, assuming the interest on convertible debt was never recognized for that period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 the Company excluded amortization of debt issuance costs and interest charges for the period January 1, 2022 to March 4, 2022 of $0.4 million (tax effected) from the numerator.

FOOTNOTES FOR ALL TABLES ABOVE: (1) Base revenue excludes COVID-related revenue and excludes acquisition-related revenue contribution in current periods for which there was no prior year comparables. (2) Prior year acquisition revenue moved to \"Base\" for current year vs. prior year comparative purposes. (3) In July 2023, we began restructuring activities to simplify and streamline our organization and strengthen the overall effectiveness of our operations. In addition to the initial efforts contemplated in July, the Company continued further restructuring activities during the three months ended December 31, 2023. These activities in the fourth quarter primarily included the adjustment of finished goods and raw material inventory balances down to their net realizable value from continued evaluation of the analyses started in the third quarter, such as shelf-life stability tests. Where demand has reduced, the value of this inventory, mostly secured during the COVID-19 period, exceeded the projected requirements to be used before reaching their expiration date. In addition, restructuring activities included costs related to the consolidation of a portion of our manufacturing facilities between certain U.S. locations and severance & employee related costs. (4) The twelve months ended December 31, 2022 represented amortization of debt issuance costs for the period April 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 in addition to the amortization of debt issuance costs for the period March 5, 2022 to March 31, 2022 after the Second Supplemental Indenture was filed. Debt issuance cost for the period January 1, 2022 to March 4, 2022 were already reflected in the GAAP net income per share - diluted EPS under the if-converted method of calculating diluted EPS for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. (5) During the fourth quarter of 2023 we recorded foreign currency gains on certain intercompany loans of $7,743. The impact was recorded to the Other income (expenses), net line item within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. (6) GAAP loss per share - diluted for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was determined excluding the effect of 626,847 shares of dilutive shares as the impact of such shares would have been antidilutive due to the net loss for the period, while the adjusted earnings per share - diluted for the same period was determined based upon diluted shares of 56,442,512 shares. (7) Includes amortization of milestone payments in accordance with GAAP of $28 for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and $111 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. (8) Excludes $3,816 of accelerated depreciation related to the Restructuring Plan for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. This amount is included in the depreciation line item of this table.",
