        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nBeing a top-tier journalist isn't for everyone.\n\nI was reminded of this while chatting with seven-time Gerald Loeb award winner (the highest honor bestowed upon a business journalist), Allan Sloan, on my Opening Bid podcast this week. Sloan \u2014 who has been doing this crazy gig for more than 50 years \u2014 was recalling intense phone chats he had with then-NYC real estate developer Donald J. Trump.\n\nOther tales he spun include tough questions he posed to bombastic CEOs, and digging into companies to reveal a true picture for investors.\n\nListening to Sloan reaffirmed to me why (or partly why) I approach everything I do in this field with a sense it may all be taken away tomorrow. At the same time, the conversation was another proof point that if you want to excel, you have to do it way better than your competitor sitting at a similar desk across town or across the country.\n\nAnd if you can make that extra phone call at midnight to a source, send that one key email at 3 a.m., or take one more meeting at a bar after a long day, it can pay dividends in big ways.\n\nThese behind-the-scenes efforts tend to pay off in key moments in the business cycle or markets. Take, for example, this earnings season, where I've been chatting with leaders of public companies and top investing minds at the big banks.\n\nThe chats this go around have a different vibe to them, months removed from Election Day.\n\nIn the case of some, we are discussing the state of a consumer that has been less confident. In others, we are getting right into concerns about the run-up to the election and what policies may shape profits in 2025 and beyond.\n\nHere's what I am hearing, obtained simply by talking to a lot of people \u2014 just like an OG journalist such as Mr. Sloan has done for years.\n\nOtis CEO Judy Marks\n\nElevator maker Otis (OTIS) didn't have a blowout quarter this week. Instead, the company issued a warning on China demand.\n\nMarks \u2014 who also sits on the board of dump truck maker Caterpillar (CAT) \u2014 offered up observations on potential new tariffs, which Trump has floated. Our full interview can be seen in the above video.\n\n\"I think tariffs impact the American economy. They impact the American citizen no matter what they buy. We've seen that since tariffs have continued to go up regardless of which party wins. We need a pro-growth environment that allows us businesses that are multinational businesses to operate in a high-quality trade environment that everyone understands.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo that we can compete and when we can compete overseas, it drives additional economic growth and jobs here in the US, and that goes across all industries. A trade war, a tariff war, is not in the American economy's best interests, nor in our citizens' best interest.\"\n\nWhirlpool CEO Marc Bitzer\n\nAppliance giant Whirlpool (WHR) also had a tough quarter, fueled by softness in the US housing market. In talking to Bitzer, I didn't get the sense the company's US business would inflect this year even if the Fed cuts interest rates in the fall.\n\nNote that Bitzer declined to comment on whether European industrial behemoth Bosch has expressed interest in buying the company, as has been recently reported.\n\n\"As we internally talk about, interest rates don't change demographic trends or the age of the housing stock. The age of the housing stock is the highest it's been in my history.\n\nDemographic trends are strong. It's the interest rates, mortgage rates, and this famous lock in effect which many consumers experience, which holds everything back. I would, however, be cautious. One interest rate reduction won't unfreeze the market. I think it will take several moves. I would expect that probably you need mortgage rates to be in the five-something range to really see some momentum building.\"\n\nGeneral Motors CFO Paul Jacobson\n\nUnlike the two names mentioned above, General Motors (GM) did have a very solid quarter \u2014 markedly better, I would argue, than Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA).\n\nNo doubt EVs have become politicized this presidential election cycle. Jacobson told me the company is trying to \"rise above\" the political theater.\n\nHe did acknowledge, though, that GM has benefited from the Biden administration's efforts to promote EVs in the country, from building out the charging network to offering a $7,500 tax credit to EV buyers. How that shifts under a potential Trump-led White House is unknown.\n\n\"I think we've obviously benefited from some of the jobs incentives and industry creation, but we've created thousands of jobs at our battery cell plants, module assembly, etc. And these are good, strong union jobs by American workers. So we're going to continue to invest. We're in this for the long term because, as we see it, it's about consumer choice.\"\n\nAmerican Express CEO Stephen Squeri\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) continues to feel the tailwind of younger consumers paying up to be cardholders, in part as it adds more perks (such as these new ones, reported by Yahoo Finance's personal finance team).\n\nThat appeared to be enough for Amex to hike its full-year guidance, despite signs of a more cautious consumer. The company is also lifting its full-year marketing budget by a whopping $800 million.\n\nI asked Squeri if he was more cautious on the second half of the year:\n\n\"If I was baking in more caution I wouldn't have raised the guidance. I wouldn't be increasing the marketing and so forth. I think that the key point here is the Fed will do what the Fed is going to do probably in September. They are certainly not going to raise rates, they'll probably be cut, they'll probably be another cut before the end of the year. I think that'll help consumer confidence. I think we'll see whatever happens in the election in November, which I don't think anybody has any idea and the reality is, this company has been around 174 years with 30 presidents \u2014 we'll get through whatever is we need to get through.\"\n\nChipotle CFO Jack Hartung\n\nHartung will be retiring soon from Chipotle (CMG) after a successful 23-year run as CFO. Very few have done it better.\n\nBut before he exits, Hartung did highlight a few challenges on his earnings call this week. One that stood out to me was resistance to higher prices in California after the state raised its minimum wage for food workers.\n\nI'm not used to Chipotle calling out price resistance.\n\nHere's what Hartung told me:\n\n\"We did have to increase prices between 6.5% to 7% when we raised wages almost 20%. And what we've seen is not so much resistance. So it's not because the Chipotle burrito costs a little more. There's really reduced spending across the restaurant industry. And when we've looked at it, restaurant companies that took a very high increase [in California] had an impact on sales, about the same as what we've seen. Restaurants that have taken no increase had the same kind of reduction in sales.\n\nSo it's really because everything is more expensive. The customer has pulled back on dining out pretty much across the board.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson\n\nWilson lead a large team at Morgan Stanley (MS), and speaks to some of the most influential investors in the world. He's one of the most widely followed strategists on Wall Street, amid years of on-the-mark calls (such as his 2022 bear market prediction).\n\nWith tech stocks coming under fresh pressure this week, what Wilson told me on Opening Bid regarding AI stock valuations was intriguing:\n\n\"AI is sucking all of the oxygen out of the room. But now I think we are entering that dangerous part of the story where we need to see it in the numbers. I see AI everywhere, except in the numbers. Outside of a few companies where it's obviously been dramatic, it hasn't really driven revenues and earnings anywhere.\"\n\nMore on the AI trade here.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business on Opening Bid.

Or listen and subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nSpeaking of AI, in the below Opening Bid episode veteran tech investor Eric Jackson of EMJ Capital shares why he thinks Nvidia's (NVDA) valuation could double before year-end.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "General Motors (GM) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why",
        "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this an automotive manufacturer is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for General Motors is 16.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 26.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 14.3%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nRight now, General Motors has an S/TA ratio of 0.64, which means that the company gets $0.64 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.45, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And General Motors looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 3.1% this year versus the industry average of 0%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for General Motors have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 5.3% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGeneral Motors has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that General Motors is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Electrifying Its Best-Selling Pickup Isn't Enough To Bring Ford To The Promised EV Land",
        "content": "Electrifying Its Best-Selling Pickup Isn't Enough To Bring Ford To The Promised EV Land\n\nOn Wednesday, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) issued its second quarter results. Expectations were high after its Detroit peer, General Motors (NYSE: GM) lifted its full year profit guidance a day earlier. However, despite posting solid financials that topped estimates and raising its financial targets, shares of GM fell on Tuesday as Wall Street seems to fear the good times won\u2019t last.\n\nAlthough Ford did not follow the footsteps of GM, its\u00a0CEO Jim Farley\u00a0assured investors that Ford+ restructuring plan is on track as the Blue Oval continues to seek greater profitability.\n\nSecond quarter highlights\n\nFor the April through June quarter,\u00a0overall revenue, including its finance business, increased about 6% YoY to $47.81 billion. Automotive revenue amounted to\u00a0$44.81 billion, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of $44.02 billion.\n\nFord Blue, which stands for traditional business operations, brought in $1.17 billion.\u00a0Ford Pro commercial business exceeded the traditional business as it brought in $2.56 billion, while the \u201cModel e\u201d EV unit reported a loss of $1.14 billion. However, this does not mean that Ford\u2019s EV sales are not doing well as quite the opposite, they\u00a0surged 61.4%during the reported quarter fueled by Mustang Mach-E, Ford Lightning pickup, and E-Transit EV van.\u00a0General Motors also reported EV deliveries surged 40% YoY during the second quarter.\n\nIncreases\u00a0in its warranty reserves used to pay for vehicle issues weighed down profitability. Although CFO John Lawler\u00a0did not disclose the total warranty costs, he did reveal they were $800 milion greater compared to the previous quarter. Net income for the second quarter was $1.83 billion, or 46 cents per share with the adjusted EBIT declining 27% YoY to $2.76 billion or 47 cents per share, short of LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of 68 cents.\n\nRaised gree cash flow guidance, but earnings outlook left without a lift.\n\nFull year guidance was maintaned, with adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, expected in the range between $10 billion and $12 billion.\n\nFord+ restructuring plan remains on track.\n\nWith recent initiatives aimed at improving quality, Ford expects to bring down future warranty costs.\u00a0Lawler spoke of Ford making a real progress in raising quality, lowering costs and reducing complexity across the entire enterprise, which will undoubedly benefit the GM rival down the road. When announced in May 2021, the Ford+\u00a0initially revolved around EVs, but it has since been adjusted to adapt to customer choice and finding next-generation EVs that would drive profits. Now more realistic and sharpened, Ford\u2019s vision includes a small next-generation EV platform, which is a contrast compared to its best-selling pickup maker identity.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut,\u00a0EVs still only make a fraction of total sales.\n\nDuring the earnings call, Farley stressed that Ford is focusing on smaller and more profitable EVs in an effort to compete with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Chinese rivals like BYD. Although the EV unit reported remarkable growth, enabling Ford to keep its second best sellling EV maker position in the U.S. right behind Tesla, outpacing GM, Ford is still facing significant challenges on this front as it also gudied for a full year loss of\u00a0\u00a0$5.5 billion. Impressively,\u00a0the electric version of the F-150, the Lightning, recorded a sales jump of 77% while Mustang Mach-Efollowed with a surge of 46.5%, but the E-Transit van won the race with a sales rise of 95.5%.\u00a0\u00a0But the reality is that Ford has cut back on the productoion of Lightning and delayed abouy $12 billion in EV spending in response to slower than expected demand.\n\nAs for GM, EVs made only\u00a03.2% of\u00a0\u00a0total second-quarter U.S. sales.\u00a0GM does expect to become profitable in this arena, on a productio or contribution-margin basis, once it reaches the output of 200,000 units which is expected by the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the EV landscape continues to evolve, with innovative companies like Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP) expected to raise the bar when it comes to electric pickups. This summer, Worksport is expected to launch the Alpha release of its solar-powered tonneau cover, Solis. Worksport is epxected to make quite a contirbution to the automotive sector with its intellectual asset portfolio. Together with the COR, a portable battery system, the SOLIS part of a power duo that Worksport developed with which it promises off-grid power on the go. The Solis will be available for the Ford F-150 Lightning, as well as light pickup trucks from General Motors, Stellantis, opening many new possibilities. As history has showed us, innovation has the way of paving the way for success. Therefore, just because it currently seems that the EV revolution is slowing down, it does not mean things could change in a blink of an eye when powerful innovation enters the room.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Is General Motors (GM) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about General Motors (GM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nGeneral Motors currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.81, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 21 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.81 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 21 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 61.9% and 4.8% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GM Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for GM\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for General Motors here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying General Motors, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in GM?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for General Motors, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5.3% over the past month to $9.73.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for General Motors.

        "title": "General Motors (GM) Dips 11% Since Q2 Results: Time to Buy?",
        "content": "U.S. legacy automaker General Motors GM reported second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 23, before the opening bell. Since then, shares of the company have declined 11% despite better-than-expected earnings and sales and a raised full-year outlook. Investors are seemingly disappointed by weak China results, scaled-back electric vehicle (EV) plans and a $600 million charge for the struggling Cruise autonomous vehicle (AV) unit. Does the recent dip present a buying opportunity? Or is more correction on the horizon? Before discussing that, let\u2019s take a closer look at the highlights of GM\u2019s latest quarterly results.\n\n6 Key Takeaways From GM\u2019s Q2 Results\n\nImpressive Top and Bottom-Line Numbers: GM reported earnings per share of $3.06, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.67 and came in higher than $1.91 reported in the year-ago quarter, delivering an earnings surprise of 14.6%. Revenues of $47.97 billion beat the consensus mark by 5.63% and rose from $44.75 billion a year ago.\u00a0The outperformance can be largely attributed to the impressive results of the GMNA (GM North America) segment.\n\nRaised Outlook: For 2024, GM now forecasts adjusted EBIT of $13-$15 billion, up from $12.5-$14.5 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $9.5-$10.5, up from $9-$10. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is projected in the band of $9.5-$11.5 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $8.5-$10.5 billion.\n\nBuyback Program: Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $5.3 billion. During the second quarter of 2024, GM bought back $1 billion of shares, and in June, it authorized an additional $6 billion for share buyback, indicating confidence in its financial stability and future performance.\n\nStruggles in China: On the flip side, unexpected losses in China spooked investors. After incurring a loss of $106 million from China operations in the first quarter of 2024, GM had expected to return to profitability in the region by the second quarter. However, it posted a loss of $104 million in the quarter under review amid fierce competition from local and foreign automakers. What\u2019s worse, GM\u2019s CEO Mary Barra expects the rest of the year to remain challenging as the headwinds are not likely to ease.\n\nSlowdown in EV Plans Despite Sales Growth: On the earnings call, Barra announced a second delay in the opening of a Michigan EV truck factory to mid-2026 and postponed the launch of Buick's first EV, initially slated for 2024. Despite a 40% year-over-year increase in EV deliveries in the quarter under discussion, GM is slowing investments to match demand, affected by high prices and limited charging infrastructure. Recently, GM\u2019s closest peer, Ford F, also scaled back EV plans, opting to expand an Ontario factory for combustion-engine trucks instead.\n\nStory continues\n\nCruise Challenges: GM\u2019s AV unit, Cruise, faced a setback with an indefinite delay in the production of its self-driving car Origin. The company recorded a nearly $600 million charge in the second quarter of 2024 for abandoning Origin. Instead, Cruise will utilize GM\u2019s Chevrolet Bolt, which is set to be relaunched next year, for its self-driving taxis.\n\nAssessing GM\u2019s Potential\n\nWell, Barra\u2019s cautious commentary on GM\u2019s China business is concerning. The company is restructuring its operations in the country after efforts to cut costs and inventories fell short. Also, near-term challenges prevail in improving its EV profitability. CFO Paul Jacobson anticipates EV profitability on a contribution-margin basis once production hits 200,000 units by the fourth quarter.\n\nDespite these near-term concerns, GM remains a formidable player in the automotive industry. It is the top-selling automaker in the United States, benefitting from strong demand for its quality pickups and SUVs, which is driving profit growth. The company is also optimistic about its EV business, with the Ultium Drive system and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing expected to enhance its e-mobility capabilities in the long term.\n\nGM\u2019s existing and upcoming EV offerings, including Cadillac Celestiq, Chevrolet Silverado EV, Cadillac Escalade IQ, Chevrolet Blazer EV, Chevrolet Equinox EV, Cadillac Lyric, GMC Hummer EV SUV and pickup, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac Optiq and BrightDrop Zevo, are expected to drive the company\u2019s EV momentum.\n\nAdditionally, GM is on track to achieve its $2 billion net cost reduction program by the end of 2024 and has sufficient cash reserves to handle short-term challenges, with total automotive liquidity of $35.8 billion as of Jun 30, 2024.\n\nShould Investors Buy GM Stock Now?\n\nDespite having dipped 11% in the last three trading sessions, GM is up 23% year to date, handily outperforming its industry and its peers like Ford and Stellantis STLA.\n\nYTD Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, General Motors is trading relatively cheap. Going by its price/sales ratio, the company is trading at a forward sales multiple of 0.28, below its median of 0.34 over the last five years. It is also trading at a discount compared to the industry\u2019s 1.53. The company has a Value Score of A. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GM\u2019s 2024 and 2025 EPS implies a 24% and 2% uptick, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Encouragingly, GM is also witnessing northbound estimate revisions for the current and the next year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGM's strategic focus on cost reduction, cash liquidity, and its evolving EV and AV initiatives position it well for future growth. Given the company\u2019s strong fundamentals, attractive valuation and positive estimate revisions, we believe investors should consider parking their cash in General Motors at its current price levels for solid long-term returns.\n\nGeneral Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). \u00a0You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Ram, Jeep-maker Stellantis stock sinks on disappointing results, following those of Big 3 rivals GM, Ford",
        "content": "Stellantis (STLA) stock tumbled following lackluster first-half results, the final Big Three automaker to disappoint investors this earnings season. Stellantis \u2014 the name behind brands including Dodge, Jeep, and Chrysler \u2014 blamed bloated inventories, heavy discounting, shifting product strategies, and restructuring costs for shortfall.\n\nOverall, Stellantis reported net revenues of \u20ac85.0 billion ($92.21 billion), slightly below the Bloomberg consensus estimate of \u20ac87.127 billion ($94.62 billion), a drop of 14% compared to a year ago. Stellantis\u2019s net income fell 48% to \u20ac5.6 billion ($6.1 billion), widely missing the \u20ac7 billion ($7.6 billion) Bloomberg consensus estimate.\n\nStellantis shares trading in New York fell more than 7% in early trade on Thursday.\n\nStellantis\u2019s other key metrics also disappointed. Adjusted operating income (AOI) fell to \u20ac8.5 billion ($9.221 billion), down a whopping \u20ac5.7 billion, or 60% compared to a year ago. AOI margin, a measure of profitability, fell 440 basis points from a year ago to 10%, with Stellantis attributing the drop to a decline in shipments, product mix, and FX headwinds.\n\n\u201cThe Company\u2019s performance in the first half of 2024 fell short of our expectations, reflecting both a challenging industry context as well as our own operational issues,\u201d Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said in a statement. \u201cWe have significant work to do, especially in North America, to maximize our long-term potential.\u201d\n\nTavares noted on the analyst call following the release of results that the company was \u201cin a transition, difficult period,\u201d meaning it will perform \u201ccorrective action\u201d as it looks to launch several new products; move older, bloated inventory (especially in North America); and continue with its EV game plan of a \u201cmulti-energy\u201d strategy \u2014 meaning several types of electrified and internal combustion powertrains.\n\n\u201cWe are pushing hard in North America; it\u2019s our biggest territory,\u201d CFO Natalie Knight added on the call.\n\nCombined global shipments for the automaker hit 2.931 million units, down 12% compared to a year ago. North American shipments fell 18%, however, and Stellantis said it may kill off unpopular models and revive models like the Dodge Charger to gain back market share. Stellantis will also cut prices and production in North America to improve sales and reduce inventory bloat. 2024 Jeep Wagoneer S Launch Edition. (Stellantis) (Jeep)\n\nInvestor disappointment in Stellantis\u2019s performance comes on the heels of discouraging results posted by Big Three rivals GM and Ford earlier this week.\n\nGM, despite an earnings beat and guidance boost, saw its shares fall as the company once again pushed back an EV plant start date, with analysts also concerned the company's earnings peak was behind it.\n\nStory continues\n\nFord\u2019s second quarter performance was also punished by the market, as its big profit miss caught investors off guard. Ford blamed rising warranty and recall losses for the miss, but said its guidance for the rest of the year was intact. Ford also lost over a billion dollars in adjusted EBIT in its Model e EV business, but the company\u2019s EV sales were still strong.\n\nThe two other large multinational automakers, Volkswagen and Toyota, will report results next Thursday, Aug. 1.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

        "content": "Shares in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell sharply on Wednesday after the automaker reported Q2 earnings and auto margins that missed analyst expectations.\n\nThe stock plunged more than 12% on the day, erasing nearly all of its July gains.\n\nRBC Capital Markets analysts acknowledged the near-term setup for Tesla stock could be challenging and remain that way for more than 5 quarters ahead. However, analysts added they \u201csee a critical lever that Tesla has to pull that could change the narrative on the stock immediately.\n\n\u201cAnd this would be cutting the price of FSD,\u201d they highlighted.\n\nRBC notes that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) product, now priced at $99 per month, has seen a significant increase in usage.\n\nFollowing a free trial in March and a price reduction from $200 to $99 per month, cumulative miles driven surged by 60% in Q2 compared to Q1 of this year. A year ago, 400,000 Tesla customers in North America were using the FSD beta, and that number has risen substantially over the past three months.\n\n\"All that said, while FSD take rates have expanded dramatically in recent months, we estimate FSD penetration of Tesla's fleet is in the single digits,\" the analysts said.\n\nStill, other OEMs offer Level 2+ pricing much lower than Tesla's $99 per month rate, RBC pointed out.\n\nCiting its recent talks with BMW (ETR:BMWG), the investment bank learned that the German auto giant\u2019s 5-Series in California has a take rate exceeding 30% for a product priced at $2,650.\n\nAssuming a $99 per month price for Tesla's FSD, this equates to a $7,000 cost over six years. Both General Motors Company's (NYSE:GM) Supercruise and Ford's (NYSE:F) Bluecruise are similarly priced to BMW's offering. The analysts believe that if Tesla reduced its FSD price to match its competitors, it could significantly boost take rates.\n\n\"This could translate to immediately improved margins and more importantly, highlight the autonomy narrative and multiple on Tesla shares instantly, instead of waiting for robotaxis,\" they said. \"It could also highlight the potential for Tesla to license FSD to other OEMs.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nIs there a reason to own Tesla stock near term given the headwinds?

        "title": "General Motors Company (GM): Why Do Analysts Recommend This Manufacturing Stock?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Manufacturing Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.In this article, we are going to take a look at where General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) stands against the other manufacturing stocks.\n\n2024 is seeing a momentous shift in global manufacturing trends that have cemented themselves over the past three decades. After China opened its economy in 1978, its sizeable population coupled with low living standards that resulted in lower wages attracted Western firms to its shores. Fast forward to 2024 and the biggest Western companies all rely on Chinese firms for their mass production needs and the disputed region of Taiwan houses the world's biggest contract chip manufacturer.\n\nHowever, now, these trends are reversing. Prior to and leading to the coronavirus pandemic, China's share of global manufacturing rose to 31% in 2021 from 26% in 2017, and during the same time period, the Chinese share of the world's manufactured exports jumped to 21% from 17%. These trends came as global manufacturing dropped because of the pandemic, but their reversal started in 2023 when data from the first quarter revealed that the share of Chinese made products in US imports stood at 13.3%. This marked a sharp decline from 2017's 21.6% and was the lowest figure since 2003. These trends were also visible in the Kearney Reshoring Index, which indicates that US imports from low cost Asian countries declined by $143 billion in 2023, with Mexico crossing mainland China as the largest exporter to America for the first time since 2013 through its 32% growth.\n\nThe US and China are decoupling, and this is leading to some interesting, obvious, and unpredictable dynamics. First of all, during the same year, China's share of American imports dropped, and US manufacturing companies grew their construction projects that covered a wide variety of industries such as food and beverage, chemicals, and chip production. Data shows that in the 12 months ending in August 2023, construction spending for manufacturing facilities surged by a whopping 80%. Mind you, this came at a time when interest rates had soared to decade high levels as the Federal Reserve battled high interest rates. Electronics led all sub categories by marking a jump of 237%, while other non residential construction spending grew by a rather paltry 6%.\n\nWhile we'll get to the reasons behind this surge in electronics in a bit, the US is not the only country in North America that's seeing a resurgence in manufacturing spending. Right down the Southern border, Mexico is witnessing a similar boom. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) data outlines that capital inflows in Mexico are expected to grow 10% annually to touch $650 billion by 2027. This is fueled by nearly 500 foreign companies either setting up or increasing their presence, including big ticket US automakers that have traditionally relied on their Mexican plants for lower costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, these near shoring trends aren't driven only by American companies, as Chinese companies are also eager to move to Mexico and benefit from the country's trade ties and proximity to America. This is because as of Q3 2022, within the 5 million square meters of land acquired by new companies, 80% belonged to Chinese companies with American firms coming in second place at 14%. While the impact of this exodus on the Chinese economy is hard to quantify, research suggests that it could lead to anywhere between 1.3 million to 1.9 million jobs being lost in China.\n\nAdditionally, while the Chinese economy is slowing down due to the effect of the post pandemic policies, global growth expectations are also expected to stay muted. We're in a historic era of high interest rates that raise the costs of setting up new plants. According to the IMF, global economic growth will remain muted in 2024 and 2025 and continue to sit at 3.2% during both years. Growth in advanced economies is expected to slightly pick up to 1.7% in 2024 over 2023's 1.6%, while the developing world's growth can slow down to 4.2% this year from last year's 4.3%.\n\nThis decoupling between China and the West is the clearest in high growth and high technology industries of electric vehicles and semiconductor fabrication. Within the US, the Biden Administration's CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)\u00a0 have authorized $280 billion and $500 billion in spending and tax cuts, respectively, to spearhead semiconductor fabrication and clean energy technologies in America. The IRA in particular incentivizes EV sourcing and assembly in America. For an EV to qualify for tax credits up to $7,500, its manufacturer must assemble the final product in America and source a certain portion of its raw materials from North America or countries that have trade agreements with the U.S. Additionally, not only does the CHIPS Act prevent companies that use its funds from using the profits from facilities set up with the funds to set up plants in countries hostile to America, but it also incentivizes global and local companies to set up their factories in America.\n\nThese seismic-level shifts occur just as Europe increased tariffs on Chinese EVs to as much as 37.6%, a striking blow delivered precisely when Chinese EVs were soaring in popularity on the continent. The EV industry isn't the only one that benefited from the IRA. On the act's first anniversary in July 2023, more than 170,000 jobs were added across America along with 272 new clean energy projects for $278 billion in new investments. These include an expansion of the world's largest wind turbine factory in Pueblo, Colorado, Minnesota's largest solar power plant, and America's first facility to make polisilicon based solar cells.\n\nAs the winds of manufacturing continue to shift, we decided to check what manufacturing stocks are on the analysts' radar.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best manufacturing stocks according to analysts, we ranked the top 50 holdings of iShares' synonymous named ETF and added some stocks of our own with a sizeable manufacturing presence in America by the average analyst share price target upside and picked out the top stocks.\n\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA group of technicians in a garage, inspecting car parts and ensuring safety compliance.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q1 2024: 78\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Upside: 20%\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $55.64\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is one of the biggest automotive manufacturers in America. This provides it with a set of advantages and disadvantages that it has to balance out in today's changed industry. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)'s advantages come in the form of a dominant position in the traditional car industry which provides it with hefty revenue and cash which it can reinvest in risky EV manufacturing. It also provides General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) with a fortress balance sheet through its $18.8 billion in cash. At the same time, it also means that the firm has to pivot to an emerging technology which requires General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) to rethink its business model while competitors like Tesla enjoy the agility that comes with being an upstart in a new industry. Therefore, the stock hinges on how well General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) can scale up its EV production, and whether it can match competitors in high tech areas like self driving. On this front, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) second quarter wasn't great as it took a $600 million hit on its Cruise platform, delayed an EV plant in Detroit and a battery powered vehicle, and posted a $104 million loss in China.\n\nOverall GM ranks 6th on our list of the best manufacturing stocks to buy according to analysts.

        "title": "GM &amp; TSLA Face Roadblocks in Robotaxi Race as Waymo Leads",
        "content": "With the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in advanced driver-assistance systems, robots are finally taking over the wheels. Progress is underway with auto and tech giants racing toward automated mobility. While some companies are making tangible strides, others are encountering fresh financial and technical challenges.\n\nYesterday, key contenders in the self-driving space \u2014 Alphabet GOOGL, General Motors GM and Tesla TSLA \u2014 reported their quarterly results, shedding light on their advancements in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. Alphabet announced increased investment in Waymo, while General Motors\u2019 Cruise indefinitely delayed production of its Origin self-driving shuttle. Meanwhile, Tesla postponed the unveiling of its robotaxi from Aug 8 to Oct 10.\n\nWaymo the Frontrunner\n\nAlphabet's self-driving subsidiary, Waymo, continues to dominate the AV space. The tech giant reaffirmed its commitment to the self-driving future by announcing a new $5 billion investment in Waymo on its second-quarter earnings call. This investment, spread over multiple years, underscores Alphabet's belief in Waymo's potential.\n\nThe investment comes as Waymo plans a significant expansion across the San Francisco Peninsula, throughout greater Los Angeles, and in Austin, TX, where commercial robotaxi service is expected to start by the end of the year. Waymo has more than 600 robotaxis operating in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, making it the sole self-driving tech company with a significant commercial presence of driverless taxis in the United States.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai stated on the earnings call that Waymo offers 50,000 weekly paid trips, mainly in San Francisco and Phoenix, and has completed 2 million trips to date. Last month, Waymo opened rides to the public in San Francisco, marking a significant milestone for the company. Testing is also underway in the Bay Area. Waymo is working to access SFO airport rides, holding permits for 24/7 operation in San Francisco, parts of the Peninsula and highways to the airport.\n\nGM's Cruise Hits a Snag\n\nIn contrast to Waymo's advancements, General Motors\u2019 autonomous vehicle unit, Cruise, has hit a roadblock. GM announced an indefinite delay in the production of the Origin, a self-driving shuttle designed for use in cities. This decision was disclosed on GM's second-quarter earnings call.\n\nThe indefinite suspension of Origin's production aims to lower costs per unit and address regulatory uncertainty due to the product\u2019s unique design, which lacks pedals and a steering wheel. Instead, Cruise will continue using Chevy Bolt as its autonomous-driving platform while the company regroups after an October 2023 crash in San Francisco that caused a months-long halt in their nationwide operations.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the setback, Cruise began testing its self-driving system with human safety drivers on public roads in Phoenix on May 13. This marked the first time Cruise had tested its autonomous-driving tech since the self-imposed shutdown following the crash. The company is slowly regaining its footing after the hazardous incident. Although it might return to the Origin in the future, GM is focusing its efforts on Bolt for now.\n\nTesla\u2019s Delays\n\nTesla has also faced delays in its self-driving ambitions. CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly heralded the dawn of fully autonomous vehicles, promising groundbreaking advancements that are yet to materialize. In 2015, he projected that Tesla cars would achieve full autonomy within three years. The following year, he claimed that a Tesla car would complete a cross-country journey without human intervention by 2017. In 2019, Musk ambitiously forecasted one million robotaxi-ready vehicles by 2020.\n\nTo date, Tesla has not delivered a single robotaxi or autonomous vehicle that meets these lofty expectations. Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems, while impressive, still require driver supervision and accountability.\n\nYesterday, on its earnings call, Tesla pushed back plans to unveil its CyberCab, a dedicated robotaxi, from Aug 8 to Oct 10. Elon Musk attributed the delay to \"an important design change.\" The Tesla robotaxi and its envisioned \"unsupervised\" full self-driving software are central to the company's future.\n\nThe Competitive Landscape\n\nWhile Waymo, Cruise, and Tesla are major names in the AV industry, other companies are also making significant progress. For example, Amazon's AMZN subsidiary Zoox is taking a methodical approach to developing AVs. Founded in 2014, Zoox has not yet commercially launched its custom-built robotaxis, but this is expected to change soon. It plans to start service in Las Vegas by the end of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, Mobileye and Volkswagen are working together to deploy robotaxis. In March, they announced plans to intensify their efforts, including integrating Mobileye's self-driving systems into Volkswagen's ID Buzz vehicles.\n\nIn China, search engine giant Baidu BIDU is expanding its Apollo Go autonomous ride-hailing platform. Operating in over 10 cities, Baidu is the first to offer fully driverless services in Beijing, Wuhan, Shenzhen and Chongqing. The company aims to have a fleet of 1,000 robotaxis in Wuhan by the end of the year, using its sixth-generation robotaxi, which costs less than $30,000 \u2014 half the cost of the previous generation. These reduced costs are expected to help Apollo Go become profitable by 2025.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nThe race toward a fully autonomous future is marked by both significant advancements and notable setbacks. Alphabet's Waymo continues to lead the pack with substantial investments and successful deployments, while GM's Cruise and Tesla face challenges that delay their progress. Other players like Zoox, Mobileye, Volkswagen and Baidu are also making strides, contributing to a competitive and evolving landscape in the autonomous vehicle industry. As the technology and regulatory environment continues to develop, the journey toward widespread adoption of self-driving cars remains both exciting and uncertain.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Decoding General Motors Co (GM): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) showcases robust financial growth with a notable increase in net sales and revenue. GM's strategic focus on electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicle (AV) technology positions it well for future market trends. Despite strong performance, GM faces intense competition and regulatory challenges, particularly in international markets. GM Financial's comprehensive financing suite supports vehicle sales and contributes to overall earnings.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with GM.\n\nGeneral Motors Co (NYSE:GM), a leader in the global automotive industry, has released its 10-Q filing on July 23, 2024, providing a detailed account of its financial performance and strategic direction. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as revealed by the latest financial data. GM's financial tables indicate a year-over-year increase in net sales and revenue, with automotive net sales rising from $41,254 million to $44,060 million in the three months ended June 30, and from $77,900 million to $83,273 million in the six months ended. GM Financial also saw growth, with revenues climbing from $3,493 million to $3,908 million in the three months ended June 30, and from $6,832 million to $7,710 million in the six months ended. Net income attributable to stockholders increased from $2,566 million to $2,933 million in the three months ended June 30, and from $4,962 million to $5,913 million in the six months ended, showcasing GM's financial resilience and strategic execution. Decoding General Motors Co (GM): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nMarket Share Recovery and Brand Strength: GM has successfully reclaimed its position as the U.S. market share leader in 2022, with a share of 16.5% in 2023. This recovery is a testament to the strength of GM's brand and its ability to resonate with consumers despite previous challenges. The company's portfolio, which includes renowned brands such as Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac, and Buick, continues to drive loyalty and attract new customers. GM's brand power is not only a reflection of its historical legacy but also its commitment to innovation and quality.\n\nFinancial Performance: GM's financial health is robust, as evidenced by the growth in net sales and revenue, and a solid increase in net income attributable to stockholders. This financial stability is supported by a strong balance sheet and effective cost management strategies. GM's ability to generate significant cash flows allows for reinvestment in key areas such as EVs and AV technology, positioning the company for sustainable long-term growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nGM Financial's Support: The captive finance arm, GM Financial, has become an integral part of GM's overall strategy, providing a comprehensive suite of financing products that not only generates incremental vehicle sales but also contributes to GM's earnings. GM Financial's penetration of GM's retail sales in the U.S. stood at 39% in the six months ended June 30, 2024, highlighting its importance in supporting vehicle sales and customer retention.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nInternational Market Challenges: GM faces significant challenges in international markets, particularly in China, where intense competition and a challenging regulatory environment have led to equity losses. The profitability of GM's operations in China is being impacted by price competition and regulatory pressures related to emissions and new energy vehicles. These factors necessitate a strategic restructuring to improve performance and mitigate losses.\n\nDependence on North American Market: While GM has a global presence, its reliance on the North American market, especially the U.S., for a significant portion of its revenue and profits, exposes the company to regional economic fluctuations and market dynamics. Diversifying its revenue streams and reducing dependence on a single market could help GM mitigate this risk.\n\nSupply Chain Vulnerabilities: The automotive industry has been facing supply chain disruptions, particularly with semiconductor shortages. GM's production and sales have been affected in the past, and while the situation has improved, the company remains susceptible to such vulnerabilities, which could impact its ability to meet demand and maintain operational efficiency.\n\nOpportunities\n\nElectric Vehicle (EV) Market Growth: GM's strategic focus on EVs aligns with the global shift towards sustainable transportation. The company's commitment to an all-electric future, with investments in battery technology and new EV models, positions it to capitalize on the growing demand for environmentally friendly vehicles. GM's vision and investments in this area could lead to significant market opportunities and a stronger competitive edge.\n\nAutonomous Vehicle (AV) Technology: GM's Cruise arm, despite facing setbacks, is at the forefront of AV technology development. The resumption of supervised and manual driving operations and the focus on deploying next-generation technology in vehicles like the Chevrolet Bolt EUV present significant opportunities for GM to lead in the emerging AV market.\n\nGlobal Expansion: GM has the opportunity to expand its footprint in emerging markets, leveraging its brand strength and product portfolio. By adapting to local market preferences and investing in regions with growth potential, GM can diversify its revenue sources and reduce its reliance on the North American market.\n\nThreats\n\nIntense Competition: The automotive industry is highly competitive, with numerous established players and new entrants, especially in the EV and AV spaces. GM must continuously innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its market position and address the competitive pressures from both traditional automakers and technology-focused companies.\n\nRegulatory and Environmental Pressures: GM operates in a heavily regulated industry, with increasing focus on emissions, fuel efficiency, and safety standards. Compliance with these regulations requires significant investment and could impact profitability. Additionally, the company must navigate the complexities\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "GM is still powering toward an electric future, even if EVs have become a politicized talking point on the campaign trail.\n\n\"I think we're trying to rise above politics and make this really about consumer choice,\" GM CFO Paul Jacobson told Yahoo Finance, when asked if he's frustrated on how electrified cars are being dragged through the political mud.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has repeatedly hinted at dialing back Biden Administration's EV infrastructure investments and a popular $7,500 tax credit for consumers.\n\nJacobson said GM will continue to invest in battery production and EV-making, no matter who wins the White House.\n\nAdded Jacobson, \"We think it's an important tool [$7,500 tax credit] for some consumers today, but there are others who don't qualify for it or otherwise don't get it. And and they're buying electric vehicles as well.\" The Chevrolet pure electric concept car FNR-XE is being displayed at the SAIC-GM Pan-Asia Automotive Technology Center in Shanghai, China, on March 25, 2024. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nAfter a slow start, GM is finally gaining traction in its EV business after years of investment and some assistance from the government.\n\nThe company said it delivered 22,000 EVs in the second quarter, up 40% year over year. Popular sellers included the new Cadillac Lyriq and Chevy Blazer EV crossovers.\n\nFor 2024, GM reiterated a goal of producing 200,000 to 250,000 EVs. It also reaffirmed a target of hitting \"positive variable profits\" for the EV division this year.\n\nThe company continues to prove to Wall Street it's chugging along despite election year theatrics \u2014 and deserving of its 38% stock price appreciation this year.\n\nThe auto giant reported second quarter sales rose 7.2% year over year to $47.9 billion, besting analyst estimates for $45.46 billion. The company called out success with pickup trucks such as the Silverado and Sierra and crossovers like the Trax.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share of $3.06 improved 60.2% versus a year ago, well ahead of consensus forecasts for $2.75.\n\nShares rose 4.5% in early trading.\n\nGM's Q2 results generally out-performed industry conditions. Overall, Q2 new car and truck sales totaled over 4.1 million, up slightly year over, according to Cox Automotive. The rate of sales slowed sharply from a 5% growth rate logged in the first quarter.\n\nThe company once again hiked its annual profit forecast. GM sees full year adjusted earnings of $9.50 to $10.50 a share. Previously, it had modeled for $9.00 to $10 a share.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business on Opening Bid.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- General Motors Co.\u2019s profit surged 60% from a year ago, easily beating Wall Street\u2019s expectations on strong demand for gas-powered trucks in the US.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHarris Has Enough Delegates to Clinch Nomination for President Wiz Rejects Google\u2019s $23 Billion Offer, Seeks IPO Instead A Six-Second Decision Shows How Harris Snapped Up Delegates Trump Risks Getting Tables Turned on Him With New 2024 Adversary Harris Wins Soros Backing While Other Billionaire Donors Want an Open Contest\n\nThe automaker earned $3.06 a share on an adjusted basis in the second quarter, up from $1.91 a year ago, according to a statement Tuesday. That compared with the $2.71 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company also raised its earnings guidance by $500 million to as much as $15 billion for this year.\n\nThe automaker\u2019s stronger-than-expected performance comes mostly from its US business, where demand for pickup trucks and SUVs \u2014 along with a slowdown in sales growth of electric vehicles that lose money at current volumes \u2014 has enabled GM to maximize profits and cash flow. The Detroit-based manufacturer is delaying some of its investments in EV plants and stock buybacks have reduced the share count by 17%.\n\nRecord revenue in the quarter and first half of the year \u201chas paved the way for us to increase our guidance for full-year earnings, free cash flow and earnings per share,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said in a letter to shareholders.\n\nSimply put, GM is operating as a gasoline-fueled cash generator rather the high-tech growth machine Barra had once envisioned. Taken together, the business-as-usual nature of the US vehicle market is boosting profitability that easily offsets its struggling business in China, which continues to lose money.\n\nWhile truck profits are the main driver of earnings growth and cash flow, GM has also delayed expansion plans for EV production and reduced capital expenditures from as much as $13 billion in past years to range of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion for this year.\n\nShares of the automaker fell 6.3% to $46.42 as of 9:58 a.m. in New York. The stock is up about 29% this year.\n\nIn North America, adjusted earnings before interest and taxes grew about 39% to $4.4 billion.\n\nThe company\u2019s $48 billion in revenue in the quarter rose 7% from a year ago and beat the consensus estimate of $45.6 billion. A key driver was a nearly 5% rise in sales of GM\u2019s full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks.\n\nEV Rethink\n\nGM didn\u2019t address reports that the company has delayed its third battery cell plant that\u2019s planned with LG Energy Solution. Barra said recently that the company won\u2019t hit its goal of having production in place for 1 million EVs at the end of 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company feels it can slow its push into EVs because a lot of its investment in battery production has been made. By the end of next year, the company will have a bigger lineup of EVs than any automaker in the market. GM is already selling electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and the Blazer midsize crossover SUV and smaller Equinox.\n\nLater this year, GM plans to add an electric version of its flagship Cadillac Escalade and a GMC Sierra pickup plug in. A new Bolt compact EV comes out next year, along with a three-row Cadillac crossover called the Vistiq.\n\nThe Bolt will take on new importance for GM. When the small EV comes out next year, it will be the self-driving car employed by Cruise LLC, the automaker\u2019s autonomous vehicle unit. Barra said in her letter that GM will shelve the purpose-built Origin autonomous vehicle, a bread box-shaped shuttle that was designed for four to six passengers. She said it will be mothballed for cost and regulatory reasons.\n\nCruise lost $483 million on an operating basis in the most recent quarter, down from $611 million a year ago. The unit also took a $583 million one-time adjustment for restructuring and for costs related to shelving the Origin. The CEO said GM plans to look for a fresh infusion of captial into Cruise from outside sources this year \u2014 and has expressions of interest.\n\n\u201cWe have significant outside interest from a partner and investor perspective,\u201d Barra told analysts on a conference call.\n\nWhile cash flow remains strong from the North American business and EV plans are moving ahead slowly, GM continues to struggle in China. The company lost $104 million there in the second quarter after making $78 million a year ago.\n\nGM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said the company is talking to its Chinese partners to restructure the business.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to see challenges,\u201d he said on a call with reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen significant market share erosion and it\u2019s price competitive.\u201d\n\n(Updates from 14th paragraph with details on Cruise AV unit.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Airbnb Hosts Want Guests to Come to Them Directly The Real Reason Erewhon Is a Cult Brand Why Is the US Deficit So Big?

(b) Equity earnings related to Ultium Cells Holdings LLC, an equally owned joint venture with LG Energy Solution, are presented in Automotive and other cost of sales as this entity is integral to the operations of our business by providing battery cells for our electric vehicles (EVs). Equity earnings related to Ultium Cells Holdings LLC were $324 million and $479 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and insignificant in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nGeneral Motors Company and Subsidiaries\r\nSupplemental Material1\r\n(Unaudited)\n\nGeneral Motors Company (GM) uses both generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. Our non-GAAP measures include: earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)-adjusted, presented net of noncontrolling interests; earnings before income taxes (EBT)-adjusted for our General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial) segment; earnings per share (EPS)-diluted-adjusted; effective tax rate-adjusted (ETR-adjusted); return on invested capital-adjusted (ROIC-adjusted) and adjusted automotive free cash flow. GM's calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP measures.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve ROIC-adjusted. Management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. Further, our Board of Directors uses certain of these, and other measures, as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. For these reasons, we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful for our investors.\n\nEBIT-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net income attributable to stockholders) EBIT-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share)  EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-diluted less adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Effective tax rate) ETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Return on equity) ROIC-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and\u00a0other postretirement benefits (OPEB) liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.\n\nThe following table reconciles Net income attributable to stockholders under U.S. GAAP to EBIT-adjusted and segment profit (loss) (dollars in millions):\n\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Net income attributable to stockholders(a) $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,933 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,566 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5,913 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4,962 Income tax expense (benefit) 767 522 1,529 950 Automotive interest expense 206 226 425 460 Automotive interest income  (229) (251) (414) (479) Adjustments Cruise restructuring(b) 583 \u2014 583 \u2014 GMI plant wind down(c) 103 \u2014 103 \u2014 Buick dealer strategy(d) 75 246 171 345 Voluntary separation program(e) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 875 GM Korea wage litigation(f) \u2014 (76) \u2014 (76) Total adjustments 761 170 857 1,144 EBIT-adjusted 4,438 3,234 8,310 7,037 Operating segments  GM North America (GMNA) 4,433 3,194 8,273 6,769 GM International (GMI) 50 236 40 583 Cruise  (458) (611) (900) (1,172) GM Financial(g) 822 766 1,559 1,537 Total operating segments 4,847 3,585 8,971 7,717 Corporate and eliminations(h) (409) (351) (662) (680) EBIT-adjusted $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4,438 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,234 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,310 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7,037\n\n__________ (a) Net of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Wholesale vehicle sales data consists of sales to GM's dealers and distributors as well as sales to the U.S. government and excludes vehicles sold by our joint ventures. Wholesale vehicle sales data correlates to GM's revenue recognized from the sale of vehicles, which is the largest component of Automotive net sales and revenue. In the six months ended June 30, 2024, 26.6% of GM's wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes wholesale vehicle sales by automotive segment (vehicles in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 GMNA 903 833 1,695 1,556 GMI 140 147 243 288 Total 1,043 979 1,938 1,844\n\nTotal vehicle sales data represents: (1) retail sales (i.e., sales to consumers who purchase new vehicles from dealers or distributors); (2) fleet sales (i.e., sales to large and small businesses, governments and daily rental car companies); and (3) certain vehicles used by dealers in their business. Total vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint venture. Certain joint venture agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures, which are included in the total vehicle sales we report for China. While total vehicle sales data does not correlate directly to the revenue\u00a0GM recognizes during a particular period, we believe it is indicative of the underlying demand for GM's vehicles. Total vehicle sales data represents management's good faith estimate based on sales reported by our dealers, distributors and joint ventures; commercially available data sources such as registration and insurance data; and internal estimates and forecasts when other data is not available.\n\nThe following table summarizes industry and GM total vehicle sales and GM's related competitive position by geographic region (vehicles in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Industry GM Market\r\nShare Industry GM Market \r\nShare Industry GM Market \r\nShare Industry GM Market \r\nShare North America United States 4,195 696 16.6\u00a0% 4,227 692 16.4\u00a0% 8,048 1,290 16.0\u00a0% 7,909 1,295 16.4\u00a0% Other 1,007 131 13.0\u00a0% 921 113 12.3\u00a0% 1,898 246 13.0\u00a0% 1,714 217 12.6\u00a0% Total North America 5,202 827 15.9\u00a0% 5,148 805 15.6\u00a0% 9,946 1,537 15.5\u00a0% 9,623 1,512 15.7\u00a0% Asia/Pacific, Middle \r\n East\u00a0and Africa China(a) 5,870 373 6.4\u00a0% 6,149 526 8.6\u00a0% 11,525 814 7.1\u00a0% 11,251 988 8.8\u00a0% Other 5,107 121 2.4\u00a0% 5,236 143 2.7\u00a0% 10,645 233 2.2\u00a0% 10,815 251 2.3\u00a0% Total Asia/Pacific, \r\n Middle East and \r\n Africa 10,977 493 4.5\u00a0% 11,384 669 5.9\u00a0% 22,170 1,047 4.7\u00a0% 22,067 1,239 5.6\u00a0% South America Brazil 629 84 13.4\u00a0% 526 78 14.7\u00a0% 1,143 141 12.3\u00a0% 998 149 14.9\u00a0% Other 317 27 8.5\u00a0% 344 31 8.9\u00a0% 626 54 8.7\u00a0% 726 65 9.0\u00a0% Total South America 946 111 11.7\u00a0% 870 108 12.4\u00a0% 1,769 195 11.0\u00a0% 1,724 214 12.4\u00a0% Total in GM markets 17,125 1,432 8.4\u00a0% 17,403 1,583 9.1\u00a0% 33,885 2,779 8.2\u00a0% 33,414 2,965 8.9\u00a0% Total Europe 4,353 1 \u2014\u00a0% 4,314 1 \u2014\u00a0% 8,721 1 \u2014\u00a0% 8,402 1 \u2014\u00a0% Total Worldwide(b) 21,477 1,432 6.7\u00a0% 21,717 1,583 7.3\u00a0% 42,606 2,780 6.5\u00a0% 41,816 2,966 7.1\u00a0% United States Cars 780 53 6.8\u00a0% 835 68 8.1\u00a0% 1,489 103 6.9\u00a0% 1,542 128 8.3\u00a0% Trucks 1,126 359 31.9\u00a0% 1,132 342 30.2\u00a0% 2,062 650 31.5\u00a0% 2,128 639 30.0\u00a0% Crossovers 2,290 284 12.4\u00a0% 2,260 283 12.5\u00a0% 4,496 538 12.0\u00a0% 4,239 528 12.5\u00a0% Total United States 4,195 696 16.6\u00a0% 4,227 692 16.4\u00a0% 8,048 1,290 16.0\u00a0% 7,909 1,295 16.4\u00a0% China(a) SGMS 120 240 275 413 SGMW 253 286 539 576 Total China 5,870 373 6.4\u00a0% 6,149 526 8.6\u00a0% 11,525 814 7.1\u00a0% 11,251 988 8.8\u00a0%\n\n__________  (a) Includes sales by the Automotive China JVs: SAIC General Motors Sales Co., Ltd.

        "title": "Time to Buy Tesla, GM, or Ford's Stock as Q2 Earnings Approach?",
        "content": "Second quarter results from the major automakers will be a highlight of this week\u2019s earnings lineup with Tesla TSLA and General Motors GM set to report on Tuesday, July 23.\n\nPlus, Q2 results from Ford Motor F are on tap Wednesday. That said, let\u2019s see if it\u2019s time to buy stock in these auto giants as earnings approach.\n\nTesla Q2 Expectations\n\nNotably, Tesla\u2018s stock has been on a monstrous rally soaring over +20% in the last month. This comes as Tesla announced it delivered 443,956 EVs during Q2 which topped most analyst estimates although this was down from 466,140 deliveries in the prior year quarter.\n\nFueling the extended rally was increased deliveries from Chinese EV automakers such as Nio NIO and Li Auto LI with Tesla\u2019s factory in Shanghai being critical to its production as well. However, Tesla\u2019s Q2 EPS is expected at $0.62 compared to $0.91 a share in the comparative quarter. This is despite quarterly sales projected to rise to $25.13 billion versus $24.93 billion in Q2 2023. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQ2 Expectations for GM & Ford\n\nAs shown in Tesla\u2019s price performance chart above, General Motors and Ford\u2019s stock have also seen nice momentum leading up to their Q2 reports.\n\nBoth iconic automakers saw a hefty increase in elective vehicle sales with General Motors\u2019 EV deliveries spiking 40% during Q2 to 21,930. As for Ford, its Q2 EV deliveries soared 61% year over year to 23,957.\n\nMore impressive, General Motors' Q2 EPS is projected to expand 38% to $2.64 on sales of $44.94 billion, a slight increase from $44.75 billion a year ago. Following a tougher-to-compete-against prior-year quarter, Ford\u2019s Q2 EPS is expected to decline -14% to $0.62 with sales forecasted to dip -2% to $41.65 billion.\n\nValuation Comparisons\n\nIn terms of valuation, General Motors and Ford certainly stand out trading at just 5.1X and 6.9X forward earnings, respectively. It\u2019s noteworthy that both GM and Ford have an \u201cA\u201d Zacks Style Scores grade for Value. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStill commanding a noticeable premium to the broader market as an EV pioneer, Tesla\u2019s stock trades at a 96.4X forward earning multiple which is below its two-year high of 141.2X but above its median of 76.3X during this period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway\n\nAhead of their Q2 reports, General Motors and Ford\u2019s stock both sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Now looks like an opportunistic time to invest in General Motors and Ford considering their EV growth and cheap P/E valuations.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla\u2019s stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) after such an extensive rally over the last few months. To that point, longer-term investors may still be rewarded for holding Tesla\u2019s stock but there could certainly be better buying opportunities ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "GM Q2 earnings preview: Street hoping for boosted guidance on strong sales",
        "content": "Investors are expecting a strong second quarter from GM (GM) when the automaker reports before the bell on Tuesday, following strong sales of the automaker's gas-powered vehicles, trucks \u2014 and even EVs.\n\nFor the quarter, GM is expected to report revenue of $45.51 billion, higher than last quarter\u2019s $43 billion, and a nearly 2% rise compared to a year ago ($44.7 billion). In terms of profit, GM is expected to book $2.70 in adjusted earnings per share, translating to adjusted net income of $3.05 billion and operating profit of $3.83 billion.\n\nFollowing its strong Q1 results in April, GM lifted its 2024 guidance, with the company now expecting full-year adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of $12.5 billion to $14.5 billion, up from an outlook of $12 billion to $14 billion previously. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in between $9 and $10 per share in 2024. An upbeat Q2 report could mean GM will guide toward the higher end of its forecast or even boost full-year guidance for a second time this year.\n\nGM also said last quarter that it still expects to see \"positive variable profit,\" meaning backing out all variable costs from revenue, in its electric vehicle business in the back half of 2024.\n\nThe company had backed away from its initial big EV plans of 400,000 EVs by 2024, with CFO Paul Jacobson revealing at a Deutsche Bank conference in June that GM now expects to produce 200,000 to 250,000 EVs this year, slightly lower than the 200,000 to 300,000 unit plan.\n\nStill, Jacobson told Yahoo Finance at the conference, \u201cWe're picking up significant [EV market] share; we sold over 9,500 EVs in North America [in May].\" The Chevrolet Blazer and Cadillac LYRIQ EV had \u201creally strong gains,\u201d Jacobson added.\n\nHowever, just last week, GM CEO Mary Barra indicated that GM\u2019s target of being able to produce 1 million EVs in North America by 2025 is in jeopardy. \u201cWe won\u2019t get to a million just because the market is not developing, but it will get there,\u201d Barra said at a CNBC CEO Council event. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be guided by the customer.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, GM sales in the second quarter are boosting the company\u2019s bottom line at the right time, and EV sales that Jacobson alluded to are strong as well.\n\nIn the quarter, GM delivered 696,086 vehicles in the US, up 0.6% year over year, its best since the fourth quarter of 2020. GM also said it was the sales leader in full-size pickups, and EV sales hit a record as well.\n\nGM said it delivered 21,930 EVs in Q1, up 34% over the previous quarter\u2014and a 40% jump from a year ago. Despite pushing back on its original EV plans, GM still said it will have 10 EV models in the market by the end of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, some analysts believe GM may be a bit too ambitious with its EV rollout.\n\n\u201cWhile GM's sales exceeded estimates, aided by improved dealer inventory levels, we continue to have concerns about near-term execution risk as it attempts to ramp production of a handful of EV models featuring its Ultium platform,\u201d CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson wrote in a note to clients earlier this month. \u201cIn short, we continue to believe a healthy dose of investor skepticism toward the GM story is justified.\u201d\n\nNelson has a Hold rating and a $38 price target on GM.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article listed an incorrect spelling of Garret Nelson's name.

        "content": "GM (GM) once posted strong second quarter results, and boosted its guidance for a second time this year as customers continue buying the Detroit-based automaker's gas-powered vehicles, trucks \u2014 and even EVs.\n\nFor the quarter, GM reported record revenue of $47.97 billion versus $45.51 billion estimated (Bloomberg consensus), which represents a 7.2% jump compared to a year ago ($44.75 billion). GM reported adjusted EPS of $3.06, compared to estimates of $2.70, with GM also reporting adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of $4.438 billion, easily topping estimates of $3.88 billion.\n\nIn terms of guidance, GM reported the following updates to its full-year 2024 forecast:\n\nEBIT adjusted: $13.0 billion to $15.0 billion ($12.5 billion - $14.5 billion previous) Automotive operating cash flow: $19.2 billion - $22.2 billion ($18.3 billion - $21.3 billion previous) Adjusted automotive free cash flow: $9.5 billion - $11.5 billion ($8.5 billion $10.5 billion previous) EPS diluted-adjusted: $9.50 $10.50 ($9.00 $10.00 previous)\n\nGM shares are up 3.5% in pre-market trading following release of the results.\n\nIt was the second time this year GM boosted its full-year profit outlook. GM attributes much of this success to the popularity of its vehicles.\n\n\"I want to begin by thanking the GM team, as well as our dealers, suppliers and other business partners, for helping us deliver strong second quarter and first half results, including record revenue in both periods. This has paved the way for us to increase our guidance for full-year earnings, free cash flow and earnings per share,\" GM CEO Mary Barra said in her shareholder letter.\n\nBoosting guidance and returning cash in the form of buybacks to shareholderse is \u201ccoming from ICE [internal combustion engine] portfolio and underlying performance of the business\u2026 generating significant free cash flow,\u201d GM CFO Paul Jacobson said in a call with reporters. GM authorized a $6 billion share buyback plan in June.\n\nIn terms of its EV gameplan, GM reiterated it still expects to produce 200,000 to 250,000 EVs this year, slightly lower than the 200,000 to 300,000 unit plan, and a far cry from initial EV plans of 400,000 EVs produced by 2024.\n\nGM also committed to reaching certain profitability metrics by the end of the year.\n\n\"As excited as we are about our EVs and our early success, we are committed to disciplined volume growth, which is the key to earning positive variable profits from our portfolio in the fourth quarter, which remains our goal,\" Barra said in her letter.\n\n\"Positive variable profit\" refers to profit from sales of a certain product where only variable costs like materials are deducted from revenue. Without including \"fixed costs,\" variable profit gives a better view how profitable a product is, and how much sales are needed to break even.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, GM sales in the second quarter are boosting the company\u2019s bottom line at the right time, and EV sales are strong as well.\n\nIn the quarter, GM delivered 696,086 vehicles in the US, up 0.6% year over year, its best since the fourth quarter of 2020. GM also said it was the sales leader in full-size pickups, and EV sales hit a record as well. GM said full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra were up approximately 5% year over year in the first half of 2024, with mid-sized Colorado and Canyon pickups have their best first-half since 2019.\n\nGM said it delivered 21,930 EVs in Q1, up 34% over the previous quarter\u2014and a 40% jump from a year ago. Despite pushing back on its original EV plans, GM still said it will have 10 EV models in the market by the end of the year. 05 November 2019, US, San Francisco: A robot car of the General Motors subsidiary Cruise is on a test drive.

Cruise will be expanding to new cities, with supervised testing currently occurring in Phoenix, Dallas, and Houston. Cruise will also shift all of its vehicles to GM's Chevrolet Bolt EV platform from the Origin autonomous vehicle, which will address regulatory uncertainty GM faced with the Origin, and per-unit costs will be much lower going forward.\n\nGM will take a $600 million one-time charge for \"indefinitely suspending\" the Origin vehicle development, CFO Paul Jacobson said to reporters.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Says General Motors Is 'A Huge Annuity And Health Insurance Company With A Major Auto Company Attached'",
        "content": "Warren Buffett Says General Motors Is 'A Huge Annuity And Health Insurance Company With A Major Auto Company Attached'\n\nIn a 2006 interview with Charlie Rose, Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, shared some fascinating thoughts about General Motors (GM). This was three years before the company got into trouble and had to declare bankruptcy.\n\nDuring the interview, Rose mentioned Buffett had over $40 billion in cash, suggesting he could easily buy some big companies. However, Buffett explained that he hadn't seen any deals in the past year that excited him. \u201cThere's not one I'm envious of,\u201d he said.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAre you rich? Here\u2019s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. Many are surprised by Mark Cuban\u2019s advice for lotto winners: Cash or annuity?\n\nWhen Rose mentioned General Motors, Buffett had a lot to say. At that time, GM was valued at around $15 billion, a far cry from its past as one of the world's most powerful companies. Despite its large market share \u2013 selling 25% of all vehicles in the U.S. and one-seventh of all vehicles globally \u2013 Buffett was hesitant.\n\nHe explained that GM's financial troubles stemmed from heavy obligations, especially its United Auto Workers (UAW) contracts. These deals, made when GM was on top, became burdensome as the company's dominance faded.\n\nSee Also:General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50 per share.\n\nBuffett said: \u201cThe big problem was that they entered into contracts with the UAW, and they were based on the economics of market dominance. And they don\u2019t have market dominance anymore, but they still got the contracts. And I don\u2019t like the UAW. It was a freewill negotiation, but what they signed up for, and I think they\u2019re paying like two and a half people who don\u2019t work for every person who works in terms of retirement and health care.\u201d\n\nBuffett said, \u201cGeneral Motors is a huge annuity and health insurance company with a major auto company attached.\u201d Enormous retirement and health care costs weighed down its car business. Because of these heavy financial obligations, it was hard for Buffett to see GM as a clear investment opportunity, even though he acknowledged the company was doing its best to manage the situation.\n\nWhen Rose asked why Buffett wouldn't buy GM despite having the money, Buffett explained that GM's obligations made it hard to judge its true value. \u201cI don't know whether you can exist with the kind of obligations they've got,\u201d he said, pointing out that competitors like Toyota didn't have the same burdens.\n\nTrending:Warren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune \u2014 How much is that worth today?\n\nBuffett also discussed how investing had changed over the years. He recalled the 1970s when it was easier to find good investments. \"When I bought the Washington Post stock in 1973/1974, hundreds of companies made my test,\u201d he recalled. By 2006, though, finding suitable investments had become harder.\n\nStory continues\n\nResponding to Rose\u2019s question about being so big that he has to make a big play, Buffett exclaimed, \u201cThat\u2019s my problem. I thought it was a problem when we were much smaller, but it wasn\u2019t. But it\u2019s a bigger problem now. It\u2019ll be an even bigger problem in five years if I\u2019m lucky.\u201d\n\nHow GM is Doing Now\n\nAs of 2024, GM is performing robustly. Its market cap or net worth is around $56 billion. In the first quarter of 2024, GM reported revenue of $43 billion, a 7.6% increase from the previous year, and a net income of $3 billion. The company\u2019s EBIT-adjusted (earnings before interest and taxes) stood at $3.9 billion.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCan you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? \u2013 How does it compare to the average?

        "title": "Zacks.com featured highlights include General Motors, EnerSys, Ford Motor and Kinross Gold",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 22, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are General Motors Co. GM, EnerSys ENS, Ford Motor Co. F and Kinross Gold Corp. KGC.\n\nPick These 4 Low P/CF Stocks to Spruce Up Your Portfolio\n\nThe U.S. market experienced a decline on Jul 18 as investors shifted away from technology stocks and took profits from recent gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3%, the S&P 500 decreased 0.8%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7%. This broad sell-off in technology stocks occurred against a backdrop of growing optimism for a potential rate cut in September.\n\nInvestor caution is growing due to concerns about potential trade restrictions and geopolitical tensions, particularly impacting chip stocks. This shift in the market reflects a broader trend of repositioning as the earnings season unfolds. In this environment, value stocks may present a safer and more stable investment option.\n\nValue investing is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. It is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.\n\nThere are different valuation metrics to determine a stock's inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company's financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. General Motors Co., EnerSys, Ford Motor Co. and Kinross Gold Corp. boast a low P/CF ratio.\n\nThis metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis \u2014 the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.\n\nAnalysts caution that a company's earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.\n\nPositive cash flow indicates an increase in a company's liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company's liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.\n\nHere are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nGeneral Motors, which designs, builds, and sells cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts globally, sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 17.8%, on average. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors' current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 2.6% and 22.8%, respectively, from the year-ago period. General Motors has a Value Score of A. Shares of GM have risen 26.5% in the past year.\n\nEnerSys, the global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications, sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.7%, on average.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for EnerSys' current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 3.7% and 4.7%, respectively, from the year-ago period. ENS has a Value Score of A. Shares of ENS have lost 4.3% in the past year.\n\nFord Motor, which designs, manufactures, markets, and services a range of trucks, cars, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles and Lincoln luxury vehicles globally, carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 49.3%, on average.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ford Motor's current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period. Ford Motor has a Value Score of A. The stock has increased 3.7% in the past year.\n\nKinross Gold, a Canada-based gold mining company with operations and projects in the United States, Brazil, Mauritania, Chile and Canada, carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 46%, on average.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kinross Gold's current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 8.1% and 27.3%, respectively, from the year-ago period.

        "title": "5 Stocks With Attractive Price-to-Book Ratio Worth a Look",
        "content": "The price-to-book (P/B) ratio is widely favored by value investors for identifying low-priced stocks with exceptional returns. The ratio is used to compare a stock\u2019s market value/price to its book value.\n\nThe P/B ratio is calculated as below:\n\nP/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per share\n\nP/B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share. So, if the share price is $10 and the book value of equity is $5, investors are ready to pay two times the book value. Ideally, a P/B value under 1.0 is considered good as it indicates that the stock is potentially undervalued. However, value investors often consider stocks with a P/B value under 3.0.\n\nThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company GM, Park Hotels & Resorts PK, StoneCo STNE, EnerSys ENS and PayPal PYPL are some such stocks.\n\nNow, let us understand the concept of book value.\n\nWhat is Book Value?\n\nThere are several ways by which book value can be defined.\u00a0Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company\u2019s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.\n\nIt is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders\u2019 equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company\u2019s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.\n\nUnderstanding P/B Ratio\n\nBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.\n\nA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.\n\nFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.\n\nBut there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock\u2019s price may be significantly high \u2014 thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one \u2014 in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.\n\nIn any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.\n\nPrice to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company\u2019s sales/revenues \u2014 a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.\n\nPrice to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share \u2014 a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.\n\nPEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.\n\nCurrent Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\n\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\n\nValue Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.\n\nHere are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nHeadquartered in Detroit,\u00a0General Motors is one of the world\u2019s largest automakers. General Motors, along with its strategic partners, produces, sells and services cars, trucks and parts under four core brands \u2014 Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac.

        "content": "General Motors Earnings: What To Look For From GM\n\nAutomotive manufacturer General Motors (NYSE:GM) will be reporting results tomorrow before market hours. Here's what to look for.\n\nGeneral Motors beat analysts' revenue expectations by 2.8% last quarter, reporting revenues of $43.01 billion, up 7.6% year on year. It was a solid quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nIs General Motors a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting General Motors's revenue to be flat year on year at $45.16 billion, slowing from the 25.1% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $2.69 per share. General Motors Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. General Motors has only missed Wall Street's revenue estimates once over the last two years, exceeding top-line expectations by 3.8% on average.\n\nLooking at General Motors's peers in the industrials segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Winnebago's revenues decreased 12.7% year on year, missing analysts' expectations by 1.5%, and Badger Meter reported revenues up 23.2%, topping estimates by 6.5%. Winnebago traded down 4.9% following the results.\n\nRead our full analysis of Winnebago's results here and Badger Meter's results here.\n\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the industrials segment, with share prices up 4.5% on average over the last month. General Motors's stock price was unchanged during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $57.2 (compared to the current share price of $48.33).\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

        "title": "Biden/Harris, Nvidia's chips, Chinese rate cut - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- The volatile U.S. political situation took another turn, with President Joe Biden dropping out of race for re-election. China has attempted to boost its struggling economy but cutting interest rates, while Nvidia is developing an AI chip for the Chinese market.\n\n1. Biden bows out of presidential race; Harris to replace?\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday bowed to what seemed inevitable, and dropped out of the race for re-election amid concerns about his age and health.\n\nBiden backed his Vice President Kamala Harris for the job, putting her in pole position for the nomination which is officially scheduled for the Democratic convention on Aug. 19-22.\n\n\"My intention is to earn and win this nomination,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party \u2014 and unite our nation \u2014 to defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nThis talk of unity could see the party consider a virtual nomination ahead of the convention, and Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said the party would soon announce the next steps in its nomination process.\n\nGoldman Sachs in a note said they did not expect the Democrats' fiscal and trade policy agenda to shift meaningfully in the event that Harris is the nominee.\n\nHarris could consolidate Black support and bring into sharper focus the differences between the two sides on abortion rights, an issue that has proved significant in other polls.\n\nBut she also faces the full weight of history as she would become the first female and only the second black President, after Barack Obama.\n\n2. Futures edge higher, with tech earnings to the fore\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Monday, bouncing after hefty losses as investors rotated out of the major technology stocks.\n\nBy 04:15 ET (08:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 60 points, or 0.2%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 23 points, or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 125 points, or 0.6%.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell nearly 2% and 3.7%, respectively, marking their biggest weekly losses since April. On the other hand, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.7%.\n\nThe evolving political situation will remain in focus Monday, but there are more important earnings to digest, as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) feature in a busy week for earnings, kicking off results from the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacap group of stocks that have propelled markets since early 2023.\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM), Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are among some of the other big-name companies set to report during the coming week, while Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is set to report later Monday.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Nvidia developing AI chip for Chinese market - Reuters\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is developing a version of its flagship artificial intelligence chips for Chinese markets that will fall in line with U.S. export restrictions, according to a report by Reuters.\n\nThe world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker will work with Inspur, one of its biggest distributors in China, on a chip tentatively called the \u201cB20,\u201d the news agency said.\n\nNvidia\u2019s current AI offerings are geared specifically towards falling in line with U.S. export restrictions on China. But recent reports suggested that its offerings in the country, such as the H20, were seeing weak demand amid heavy competition from local chipmakers, specifically Huawei.\n\nIncreased interest in AI development has sparked a revenue bonanza for Nvidia, boosting the company\u2019s valuation to make it among the most valuable companies on Wall Street.\n\n4. PBOC cuts rates to boost the Chinese economy\n\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China unexpectedly cut its benchmark loan prime rates further into record-low territory on Monday, in an attempt to support the country\u2019s flagging economy.\n\nThe PBOC cut its one-year loan prime rate to 3.35% from 3.45%, while the five-year LPR, which is used to determine mortgage prices, was cut to 3.85% from 3.95%.\n\nThe cuts come just a week after softer-than-expected gross domestic product data for the second quarter ramped up concerns over slowing economic growth, increasing doubts that the central bank\u2019s full-year GDP growth target will be met.\n\nChinese officials had promised more stimulus during the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Third Plenum last week.\n\nSentiment surrounding Chinese markets remains weak though, amid speculation that Donald Trump will win a second term as U.S. president.\n\nTrump has maintained a largely negative stance towards China. His administration had imposed steep tariffs on China, sparking a trade war with Beijing in the late-2010s.\n\nA second term for Trump could entail a similar scenario, which bodes poorly for the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\n5. Crude market to return to surplus next year - Morgan Stanley\n\nCrude prices rose Monday, boosted by a surprise Chinese interest rate cut [see above], which is aimed at boosting the second largest economy in the world.\n\nBy 04:15 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.2% to $78.78 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $82.88 a barrel.\n\nConcerns over sluggish demand in China, the world\u2019s biggest oil importer, have weighed on the market, especially following softer-than-expected growth figures for the second quarter.\n\nThese gains may not last too long though, as although the crude market is currently tight, next year it will likely be in surplus, with Brent prices declining into the mid-to-high $70s range, Morgan Stanley said.\n\nThe tightness will hold for most of the third quarter, the bank said in a note dated on Friday, but equilibrium will return by the fourth quarter, \"when seasonal demand tailwinds abate and both OPEC and non-OPEC supply return to growth.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley said it expects OPEC and non-OPEC supply to grow by about 2.5 million barrels per day in 2025, well ahead of demand growth.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBiden/Harris, Nvidia's chips, Chinese rate cut - what's moving markets\n\nTaiwan June export orders miss forecast, China demand weakens\n\nChina to extend tariff exemptions for some US imports until 2025",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution Ltd. is slowing construction of its third plant with General Motors Co. in Michigan amid lackluster demand for electric cars and as foreign firms worry about political change in the US.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Exit Puts Trump Trade in Doubt as Election Gets Re-Set Biden Exits Race, Endorses Harris as She Shores Up Support Joe Biden Bows to Democrats Who Wanted Him Out, Upending US Politics Biden Is Out: What\u2019s Next for Democrats, Explained Trump\u2019s Remarks Spark Rebuke From Mexico\u2019s President-Elect\n\nSeoul-based LG Energy is \u201cadjusting the speed of overall investment\u201d and \u201cseeking ways for the flexible operation\u201d of its plants, according to a text message sent to Bloomberg News Monday. That doesn\u2019t mean the company is suspending construction, it said.\n\nKorea Economic Daily reported the news earlier citing sources it didn\u2019t identify. LG and GM started construction of the facility in 2022, pledging to spend around $2.6 billion. Operations were originally supposed to begin in the first half of next year.\n\nBattery makers globally are suffering from lower sales as consumer demand for electric cars wanes. For Korean companies in particular, the looming US presidential election is another big risk. Many invested heavily in North America after President Joe Biden\u2019s clean energy bill, which encourages the local manufacture of EVs and seeks to limit reliance on Chinese players.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has vowed to take action against the so-called Inflation Reduction Act and wind back Biden\u2019s pro-EV policies should he win the election.\n\nEarlier this month, LG Chief Executive Officer Kim Dong Myung said it was time to adjust the speed of investments, calling on employees to consider ways to increase investment flexibility and efficiency.\n\nGM, which had planned to have three plants with LG in the US in order to receive tax credits from the IRA, is meanwhile walking back expectations for the company\u2019s EV program. CEO Mary Barra said last week that GM won\u2019t have production capacity in place to build one million EVs at the end of next year, which was the previous target.\n\nIt\u2019s not only LG expressing worries over capital outlays and weakening demand for batteries.\n\nThe slowdown marks \u201ca new crisis,\u201d Yoonho Choi, the CEO of Samsung SDI Co., a supplier for BMW AG and Stellantis NV, said earlier this month. Samsung SDI has committed to two plants with Stellantis in Kokomo, Indiana, as well as another with GM in the state.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s third other large cell maker, SK On Co., has also declared an emergency after generating a big loss in the first quarter. It\u2019s a supplier to Ford Motor Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. Parent SK Innovation Co. is considering options to strengthen the competitiveness of SK On, including rolling the unit into other businesses housed under the conglomerate.\n\nStory continues\n\nSK On has two plants in Georgia and plans another in the state as part of a joint venture with Hyundai. It also had plans to build three more with Ford \u2014 two in Kentucky and one in Tennessee \u2014 using funds from the Biden administration, but Ford delayed the start of a second Kentucky facility as EV sales slowed.\n\nKorean battery makers may want to scale back their investment plans for battery plants in the US if there\u2019s any change in the IRA after the US presidential election, a June report from the state-run Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Airbnb Hosts Want Guests to Come to Them Directly The Zombie Mall King Doesn\u2019t Want to Be a Bottom-Feeder Forever Five Questions With Apollo Global Co-Founder Josh Harris Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "'Few Democrats willing to buy a Tesla' after Elon Musk backs Trump, investor warns",
        "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s endorsement of former President Donald Trump isn\u2019t sitting well with potential Tesla (TSLA) customers.\n\nNew data from analytics firm CivicScience shows Tesla\u2019s favorability among Democrats has dropped to 16% as of July 16, compared to 39% in January. Among Republicans, the data shows favorability decreased to 23% from 36% in the same time period.\n\nCivicScience CEO John Dick tells Yahoo Finance its \u201cdata has shown consistently that Democrats, more closely than Republicans, associate Elon Musk and his actions with the brand.\u201d\n\nAnd that could be problematic for the brand's business. Tesla short seller Mark Spiegel told Yahoo Finance a potential boycott from Democrats would be \u201cterrible\u201d for the EV maker.\n\n\u201cHe completely alienated most of his buying base\u2026 It's going to kill the business,\u201d Spiegel warned. \u201cI can't imagine a single Democrat, or, let's say, very few of them, willing to buy a Tesla at this point.\u201d\n\nLongtime Tesla investor Ross Gerber of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki told Yahoo Finance that he's considering selling his vehicle because Musk's endorsement \"doesn\u2019t align with my values.\"\n\n\u201cThis final stance of Elon has put me in a really difficult moral position,\u201d Gerber said. \"I\u2019m driving a Cybertruck and now it's like a MAGA truck.\u201d\n\nAccording to research firm Strategic Vision, the number of Tesla owners who identify as Democrats has dropped to 26% compared to 39% last year. The data shows a dramatic drop in November when Musk made antisemitic comments on X and has steadily decreased since then.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just pushback from Democrats that potentially spells trouble ahead for Tesla. Pros tell Yahoo Finance that threats from former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, to scrap government subsidies will also be a hit to the EV leader.\n\n\u201cIf the $7,500 credit goes away, Tesla is going to have to raise prices. And if it has to raise prices, it's going to sell fewer cars,\u201d Spiegel added.\n\nGuggenheim\u2019s Ron Jewsikow told Yahoo Finance the current $7,500 federal EV tax credit is a \u201ckey affordability enabler\u201d for the company and that repealing it would be a \"negative.\"\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding EV tax credits is nothing new to Tesla or legacy automakers. Gabelli Asset Management portfolio manager Brian Sponheimer told Yahoo Finance the topic has been a \"political football for quite some time,\" urging caution and a \"wait-and-see approach\" from investors.\n\nTrump, though, didn't sugarcoat his stance during his speech at the Republican National Convention. The former president told the crowd he would \"end the electric vehicle mandate on day one \u2014 thereby saving the US auto industry from complete obliteration, and saving US customers thousands of dollars per car.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIf Elon thinks paying Trump $45 million a month will somehow stop Trump from destroying the EV tax credit, he's 100% wrong,\u201d Gerber said. \u201cThe first thing they'll go after is all of the solar and EV tax credits. The government has a huge deficit and it's an easy thing to kill.\u201d\n\nMusk, though, isn\u2019t worried about a potential rollback in EV credits.\n\n\"Take away the subsidies,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"It will only help Tesla.\"\n\nMusk's support for Trump marks a shift from his past endorsements. In 2020, the billionaire said he voted for President Biden, and in 2016, he criticized Trump during his campaign against Hillary Clinton, saying, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States.\u201d\n\nRoughly thirty minutes after the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump at a Pennsylvania rally, Musk announced he was all in on the former president. In a post on X, Musk wrote, \u201cI fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\u201d\n\nSince then, Musk has used his megaphone on X to condemn Democrats and fuel narratives about the attempted assassination to his 190 million followers.\n\nTesla did not respond to Yahoo Finance\u2019s request for comment.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "As the second-quarter earnings season approaches, key companies worldwide will provide insights into sector performance. Investors will be particularly focused on updates from some of the 'Magnificent Seven', which will reveal whether the artificial intelligence (AI) trend continues.\n\nThe Mag 7 stocks have endured a challenging period, with the S&P 500\u2019s (^GSPC) major players\u2014Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and AmazonAJa (AMZN)\u2014experiencing a dramatic decline in market capitalisation. Over recent sessions, these tech giants have collectively shed $1.128tn in market value, marking the largest such loss since May 2022.\n\nWill the upcoming earnings reports show strong performance or a lack of momentum? Here\u2019s what to watch for:\n\nTesla (TSLA) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nTesla shares have experienced a dramatic surge this month, with the company's stock price surging by 33%. This increase has propelled Tesla's market valuation by $209bn in the first eight trading days of the month alone, surpassing the combined market value of European automotive giants Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Stellantis, which stands at $198bn.\n\nThis surge cannot be attributed to Tesla\u2019s first-quarter financial results, which revealed the lowest quarterly profits since Q2 2021, diminishing cash flow, and rising inventory levels. The second-quarter production and delivery figures, released earlier this month, indicated a 14% year-on-year decline in vehicle production and a 5% drop in unit sales, although this may have contributed to reducing some of the inventory backlog.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cQuite what inspired this romp is hard to divine, barring ongoing investor enthusiasm for companies that are perceived as AI (and autonomous driving) plays, Elon Musk\u2019s courtroom victories at Tesla and X and ongoing hopes surrounding the Cybertruck, the supercharger network and the ride-hailing app,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: How to invest in AI as the rally continues\n\nFor the third quarter, the current consensus is sales of $25.7bn and that would signify a return to growth in the top line of some 10% year-on-year.\n\nAnalysts and investors are also paying close attention to Tesla\u2019s revenue composition. In the first quarter of 2024, energy storage, energy generation, and other business lines contributed 19% to total revenues, up from 10% in the same period in 2022.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) fell to $0.37 in Q1, but analysts expect a rebound to $0.62 in Q2, though this still marks a one-third decrease compared to the same period last year. The consensus EPS forecast for Q3 stands at $0.63.\n\nAJ Bell also highlighted Tesla's strong financial position, with a net cash reserve of $21.5bn. Although a few quarters of weak cash flow are not overly concerning, shareholders will be looking for improvements in this area as an indicator of higher profitability and a more streamlined balance sheet through inventory reduction.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July*\n\nMicrosoft Corp is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, July 30, with analysts from Bank of America (BofA) forecasting potential revenue upside for the period.\n\nWall Street's consensus projects Microsoft to announce revenue of $64.2bn and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.90 for Q4. However, BofA analysts anticipate a 1% increase from their estimate of $64bn, indicating a 14% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by the robust performance of Azure, a premium mix in Office E3/E5, Copilot\u2019s initial success, and a stabilising PC/Windows market.\n\nAzure\u2019s growth is expected to remain balanced across sustained AI and core workloads, translating into a projected growth rate of 31.5%, slightly above the base expectation of 30.5%. The early traction of Copilot is also anticipated to bolster Office growth, maintaining its current valuation multiple.\n\nIn the more personal computing (MPC) segment, analysts foresee a $50m increase over the $15.5bn estimate, attributed to stronger-than-expected PC shipments.\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, BofA analysts predict continued double-digit revenue growth fuelled by ongoing strength in Azure and Office. However, they anticipate a 100 basis point decrease in margins due to increased capital expenditures driving higher cost of sales.\n\n\u201cIn an upside scenario, we believe the Office business could achieve 20% growth by Q1 fiscal 2026,\u201d the analysts noted.\n\nBofA has reiterated its \u2018buy\u2019 rating for Microsoft and raised the price target to $510 from $480, citing the potential for higher Office growth in fiscal 2025. They acknowledge that the current share price reflects a considerable amount of near-term upside.\n\n\"Microsoft is set to deliver fourth quarter results at some point next week. Investors will be hoping to see another strong showing from the cloud business, Azure. Analysts are looking for top line growth of 19.5% from Azure, which looks very achievable. Back in April, management said cloud-AI demand was outstripping supply. Despite a mammoth effort to build out compute, that supply/demand imbalance is likely to help underpin Azure growth for some time yet,\" Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\n*Date not confirmed\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nThe parent company of Google (GOOGL), is set to announce its second-quarter earnings, with analysts predicting robust performance driven by its Android platform and continued momentum in its search and cloud businesses. The company's expanding generative AI capabilities are also anticipated to have significantly contributed to its positive results.\n\nFor Q2, the Zacks Consensus Estimate places Alphabet's revenues at $70.55bn, reflecting a 13.7% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at $1.85 per share, marking a 28.5% rise from the previous year's reported figures. This estimate has seen a slight upward revision of 0.5% over the past week.\n\nHowever, rising litigation issues and associated expenses remain areas of concern for the tech giant.\n\nOne key risk is the US Department of Justice's so-called adtech trial, in which the government charges that Google monopolises key digital advertising technologies, collectively referred to as the adtech stack. Website publishers depend on that stack to sell ads and advertisers rely on it to buy ads.\n\n\"As Alphabet\u2019s second quarter earnings approach, the M&A rumour mill is swirling. If reports are true and Alphabet is in talks to buy cybersecurity firm Wizz for $23bn, it would mark a major move to beef up its security offering. Wizz has successfully taken on the likes of Microsoft and Palo Alto in the cyber space, taking market share over the past couple of years. Perhaps the biggest hurdle could be a regulator that\u2019s been a blocker for many large-scale deals \u2013 though a new team in the White House later this year could help things in that regard,\" Britzman said.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\nBank of America Securities analyst Justin Post remains bullish on the integration of Google\u2019s AI chatbot.\n\n\u201cWe remain positive on growing Gemini integration across [the] Google ecosystem and think [the] broader rollout of AI overviews will likely help drive higher usage, while AI integration can increase monetisation across Google,\u201d Post said. \u201cMoreover, with a focus on expense management, we think year-over-year margin growth in 2024 will be a bright spot and potential EPS upside driver.\u201d\n\nPost affirmed a buy rating and $200 price target for Alphabet.\n\nBMO Capital Markets raised its their price target from $215 to $222, driven by potential gains in YouTube revenue.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Thursday 25 July*\n\nAmazon is in the spotlight with a \"positive\" near-term view, as Morgan Stanley anticipates the e-commerce giant to significantly outperform in its Q2 earnings and provide optimistic guidance for Q3.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts project that Amazon will exceed consensus estimates for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by 17% for Q2 and 10% for Q3. This optimistic forecast is driven by enhanced profitability in North America tetail and accelerating growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"North America retail profitability and the accelerating growth of AWS are key factors behind our projections,\" the analysts noted.\n\nAs Amazon continues to leverage its robust retail operations and expand its cloud computing dominance, investors are looking forward to a strong financial performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIt is also a top pick for JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth both in the near and long term.\n\nHe anticipates a near-term acceleration in AWS, forecasting a 20% growth in Q4 2024. This growth is expected to be driven by easing optimisations, new workload migrations, and the ramping up of GenAI monetisation.\n\nRead more: UK to lose half a million millionaires by 2028\n\nAnmuth also projects a 190 basis point expansion in Amazon's North America operating income (OI) margin in 2024, supported by enhancements in shipping and inventory placement, increased automation, and stronger advertising revenue. Amazon's free cash flow is expected to reach $66bn in 2024 and $86bn in 2025.\n\nFor Q2, investors are looking for net sales to fall between $148bn and $150bn, with operating income ranging from $14bn to $15bn or more.\n\n\"There was also a strong showing from both the e-commerce and advertising segments over the first quarter, something investors will be keen to see continue. But markets were a little unhappy with the second quarter profit guidance of $10-14bn, anything toward the top end of that range will likely be met with a positive reaction,\" Britzman said.\n\n* Date not confirmed as the company might decide to announce results on 1 August.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 22 July\n\nMONY (MONY.L)\n\nAscential (ASCL.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nNXP Semiconductor (NXPI)\n\nTuesday 23 July\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nCompass (CPG.L)\n\nMitie (MTO.L)\n\nSK Hynix (HY9H.MU)\n\nLVMH (MC.PA)\n\nASM International (ASM.AS)\n\nThales (HO.PA)\n\nLindt (LISN.SW)\n\nAlfa Laval (ALFA.L)\n\nLogitech (LOGNE.SW)\n\nNorsk Hydro (NHY.OL)\n\nAkzo Nobel (AKZOY)\n\nRandstad (RSH.DU)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nCoca-Cola (KO)\n\nSpotify (SPOT)\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\n\nGE Aerospace (GE)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nMondelez (MDLZ)\n\n3M (MMM)\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\nMattel (MAT)\n\nWednesday 24 July\n\nReckitt Benckiser (RKT.L)\n\nUNITE (UTG.L)\n\nRHI Magnesita (RHIM.L)\n\nBreedon (BREE.L)\n\nAston Martin Lagonda (AML.L)\n\nPrimary Health Properties (PHP.L)\n\nFresnillo (FRES.L)\n\nEasyJet (EZJ.L)\n\nOxford Nanopore (ONT.L)\n\nIberdrola (IBE.MC)\n\nBNP Paribas (BNP.PA)\n\nEquinor (EQNR)\n\nBanco Santander (BNC.L)\n\nUniCredit (UCG.MI)\n\nKering (KER.PA)\n\nDeutsche Boerse (DB1.DE)\n\nOrange (ORA.PA)\n\nMichelin (ML.PA)\n\nRepsol (REP.MC)\n\nMoncler (MOV.F)\n\nJer\u00f3nimo Martins (JMT.LS)\n\nCarrefour (CA.PA)\n\nSSAB (SSAB-A.ST)\n\nKindred (UNBA.MU)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nFord (F)\n\nNewmont (NEM)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nInternational Paper (IP)\n\nThursday 25 July\n\nRELX (REL.L)\n\nLloyds (LLOY.L)\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nRentokil Initial (RTO.L)\n\nInforma (INF.L)\n\nCentrica (CNA.L)\n\nCentamin (CEY.L)\n\nHowden Joinery (HWDN.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nITV (ITV.L)\n\nHammerson (HMSO.L)\n\nVodafone (VOD.L)\n\nBT (BT-A.L)\n\nBritvic (BVIC.L)\n\nWorkspace (WKP.L)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nNestl\u00e9 (NESNE.SW)\n\nHerm\u00e8s (RMS.PA)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nChristian Dior (CDI.PA)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nEssilorLuxxotica (EL.PA)\n\nStellantis (STLA)\n\nENI (ENI.F)\n\nSt. Gobain (GOB.MU)\n\nRenault (RNO.PA)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nLinde (LIN)\n\nHoneywell (HON)\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC)\n\nKeurig-Dr Pepper (KDP)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV)\n\nBaxter (BAX)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nLiberty Global (LBTYK)\n\nHarley-Davidson (HOG)\n\nFriday 26 July\n\nSEGRO (SGRO.L)\n\nIMI (IMI.L)\n\nRightmove (RMV.L)\n\nDrax (DRX.L)\n\nNEC (6701.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nAir Liquide (AI.PA)\n\nMercedes Benz (MBG.HA)\n\nHolcim (HOLN.SW)\n\nBASF (BASA.BE)\n\nCapGemini (CGM.HM)\n\nAlstom (ALO.PA)\n\nVallourec (VK.PA)\n\nKone Cranes (KNCRY)\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nBristol Meyers Squibb (BMY)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Pick These 4 Low P/CF Stocks to Spruce Up Your Portfolio",
        "content": "The U.S. market experienced a decline on Jul 18 as investors shifted away from technology stocks and took profits from recent gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3%, the S&P 500 decreased 0.8%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7%. This broad sell-off in technology stocks occurred against a backdrop of growing optimism for a potential rate cut in September.\r\n\r\nInvestor caution is growing due to concerns about potential trade restrictions and geopolitical tensions, particularly impacting chip stocks. This shift in the market reflects a broader trend of repositioning as the earnings season unfolds. In this environment, value stocks may present a safer and more stable investment option.\r\n\r\nValue investing is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. It is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.\r\n\r\nThere are different valuation metrics to determine a stock\u2019s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company\u2019s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. General Motors Company GM, EnerSys ENS, Ford Motor Company F and Kinross Gold Corporation KGC boast a low P/CF ratio.\r\n\r\nThis metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis \u2014 the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.\r\n\r\nAnalysts caution that a company\u2019s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.\r\n\r\nPositive cash flow indicates an increase in a company\u2019s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company\u2019s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.\r\n\r\nHowever, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bargain Hunting Strategy\n\nHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:\u00a0\r\n\r\nP/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.\r\n\r\nPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\r\n\r\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\r\n\r\nP/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.\r\n\r\nP/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.\r\n\r\nP/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company\u2019s sales \u2014 the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.\r\n\r\nPEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\r\n\r\nValue Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.\r\n\r\nHere are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:\r\n\r\nGeneral Motors, which designs, builds, and sells cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts globally, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

        "title": "Here's Why General Motors (GM) is a Strong Value Stock",
        "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors alike.\n\nMany investors also have a go-to methodology that helps guide their buy and sell decisions. One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.\n\nWhy Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value Stock\n\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\nOne of the world\u2019s largest automakers, General Motors held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16.2% in 2023. Headquartered in Detroit, the auto giant has had a long and checkered history. Founded in 1908, the company rose to dominate the U.S. industry. However, hit by the financial crisis, General Motors filed for bankruptcy on Jun 1, 2009. Just within 40 days, the firm emerged from bankruptcy. In 2010, the company launched its IPO \u2013 the biggest in U.S. history at that time \u2013 and has been steadily profitable since then. From going bankrupt in 2009 to becoming one of the world\u2019s best-run car companies, General Motors has indeed come a long way.\n\nGM is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, with a Value Style Score of A and VGM Score of B. Shares are currently trading at a forward P/E of 5.3X for the current fiscal year compared to the Automotive - Domestic industry's P/E of 12.2X. Additionally, GM has a PEG Ratio of 0.5 and a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 2.6X. Value investors should also note GM's Price/Sales ratio of 0.3X.\n\nA company's earnings performance is important for value investors as well. For fiscal 2024, one analyst revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for GM, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.03 to $9.43 per share. GM also holds an average earnings surprise of 17.8%.\n\nGM should be on investors' short lists because of its impressive earnings and valuation fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and strong Value and VGM Style Scores.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "General Motors Company (GM) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of General Motors (GM)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3.9% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $50.5 in the previous session. General Motors has gained 38.2% since the start of the year compared to the -0.5% move for the Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector and the 2.6% return for the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 23, 2024, General Motors reported EPS of $2.62 versus consensus estimate of $2.08 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4.18%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, General Motors is expected to post earnings of $9.43 per share on $176.34 billion in revenues. This represents a 22.79% change in EPS on a 2.62% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $9.58 per share on $177.33 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 1.59% and 0.56%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nGeneral Motors may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nGeneral Motors has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 5.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 12.2X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 2.6X versus its peer group's average of 8.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.52. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, General Motors currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if General Motors passes the test. Thus, it seems as though General Motors shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.\n\nHow Does GM Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of GM have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Ford Motor Company (F). F has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of D, and a Momentum Score of D.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. Ford Motor Company beat our consensus estimate by 16.67%, and for the current fiscal year, F is expected to post earnings of $2.02 per share on revenue of $166.93 billion.\n\nShares of Ford Motor Company have gained 21.9% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 7.2X and a P/CF of 4.15X.\n\nThe Automotive - Domestic industry may rank in the bottom 59% of all the industries we have in our universe, but there still looks like there are some nice tailwinds for GM and F, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here Are My 2 Favorite Electric-Vehicle Stocks to Buy Right Now -- and Neither of Them Are Tesla",
        "content": "It's tough to have a conversation about electric-vehicle (EV) stocks without mentioning Tesla. But it's important to keep in mind that there could be other EV investments that are worth a look, and there are three that I like more than Tesla at their current prices.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm a big fan of Tesla and think the company has revolutionized the automotive world. When the Model S was introduced, Motor Trend named it 2013's \"Car of the Year,\" a well-deserved title. And we undoubtedly wouldn't be on the cusp of a full-scale EV adoption boom without Tesla's contributions to the industry.\n\nBut with Tesla trading at an $840 billion valuation and 95 times forward earnings estimates, there's a lot of growth priced in, and I think there are more compelling opportunities for long-term investors. With that in mind, here are my two favorite EV stocks to buy right now, and why I'm a big fan of each.\n\nA great automaker with a dirt cheap valuation\n\nGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM) is often dismissed as a \"legacy\" automotive stock, but I think it should be on the radar of every EV stock investor.\n\nFor one thing, the business is wildly profitable and doing quite well. It shattered analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines in the first quarter and grew its net income by 26% year over year.\n\nIts margins remain strong, and the company is using its cash flow to aggressively buy back stock. Over the past year alone, General Motors has reduced its outstanding share count by more than 18%.\n\nTo be fair, GM is still in the early stages of building out its EV business, but it's doing so by focusing on efficiency and profitability. The company recently reported second-quarter EV deliveries that grew 40% year over year. As it gradually rolls out electric versions of its most popular models, this figure could go through the roof.\n\nIn addition, GM has some big advantages, such as brand loyalty, a proprietary battery platform (Ultium), and relationships with corporations and the U.S. government. Despite its massively profitable business, the stock trades for just over six times trailing-12-month earnings.\n\nWarren Buffett's favorite EV stock\n\nBYD(OTC: BYDD.F)(OTC: BYDDY) is often referred to as the Tesla of China, and it's easy to see why. In one recent quarter, it actually overtook Tesla for the title of \"world's largest EV maker.\"\n\nWarren Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate are well-known for their aversion to new technologies, so you might be surprised to learn that Berkshire owns 6% of BYD. The company's late Vice Chairman Charlie Munger had extremely high praise for the company and its leadership and was the biggest reason Berkshire invested in the company. He even said, \"I have never helped do anything at Berkshire that was as good as BYD and I only did it once.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBYD started its life as a battery supplier to the mobile communications industry, and Motorola was a major early customer. But it eventually pivoted to producing electric vehicles, an industry where its battery expertise gave it a big advantage. These days, BYD makes many of its other vehicle components in-house, as well, and this vertical integration gives it tremendous cost advantages over its peers.\n\nWhile BYD's success is impressive with a 35% market share in China despite some tough competition, the company's best growth could still be ahead. At just 21 times earnings, it looks like an attractive value right now.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThese are two excellent automotive stocks that are highly profitable businesses with lots of room to grow in the coming years. There's absolutely nothing wrong with investing in Tesla if you like the company and its potential, but if you're looking for some attractively valued alternatives, keep these two EV stocks in mind.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in BYD right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in BYD, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and BYD wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "General Motors GM is slated to release\u00a0second-quarter 2024 results\u00a0on Jul 23, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings and revenues is pegged at $2.59 per share and $45 billion, respectively.\n\nThe earnings estimate for the to-be-reported quarter has remained stable over the past 60 days. The bottom-line projection indicates year-over-year growth of 35%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests a modest year-over-year increase of 0.4%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the current year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for GM\u2019s revenues is pegged at $176.4 billion, implying a rise of 2.7% year over year. The consensus mark for 2024 EPS is pegged at $9.38, implying growth of around 22.8% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nIn the trailing four quarters, this U.S. legacy automaker surpassed EPS estimates on all occasions, with the average earnings surprise being 17.75%.\n\nGeneral Motors Company Price and EPS Surprise General Motors Company Price and EPS Surprise\n\nGeneral Motors Company price-eps-surprise | General Motors Company Quote\n\nEarnings Whispers for Q2\n\nOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for General Motors this time around. The combination of a positive\u00a0Earnings ESP\u00a0and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That\u2019s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our\u00a0Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nGM has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nFactors to Shape GM\u2019s Q2 Results\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, General Motors reported its best U.S. quarterly sales in more than three years, driven by strong demand for full-size pickup trucks and electric vehicles (EVs).The company sold 696,086 units during the quarter under discussion, up 0.6% year over year. Approximately 229,000 full-size pickup trucks were delivered, up 6% year over year, marking the highest quarterly sales since 2021.EV deliveries rose 40% year over year to 21,930 units, fueled by robust sales of electric Hummer and LYRIQ.\n\nOur estimate for wholesale vehicle sales volumes in the GMNA (General Motors North America) segment is 845,000 units, suggesting a year-over-year uptick of 1.5%. We project revenues from the GMNA segment to be $37.5 billion, implying an increase of roughly 1%. Operating income from the unit is estimated at $3.37 billion, calling for growth of 5.6%.\n\nWhile sales in North America are likely to have provided a boost, weak deliveries in China are expected to limit overall revenues. GM and its joint venture delivered around 373,000 vehicles in China in the second quarter, down 29% year over year.\u00a0All of GM's brands in China saw significant declines. Buick deliveries were about 81,000, down from 136,000 in the previous year. Chevrolet delivered almost 10,000 vehicles, down year over year from 48,000. Cadillac delivered about 29,000 vehicles, down year over year from 55,000.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe also expect sales volumes from the GMI unit (excluding China JV) to be down roughly 7% in the quarter to be reported. Our projections call for a contraction of 7% and 38% in revenues and operating income, respectively, year over year.\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nOn a year-to-date basis, shares of GM have surged 44%, outperforming the industry. It has also performed better than its major peers, including Ford F, Stellantis STLA and Toyota TM.\n\nYTD Price Comparison Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, General Motors is trading relatively cheap. Going by its price/sales ratio, the company is trading at a forward sales multiple of 0.32, below its median of 0.34 over the last five years. It is also trading at a discount compared to the industry\u2019s 1.53. The company has a Value Score of A. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestor Considerations\n\nGeneral Motors' robust portfolio, encompassing EVs and internal combustion engine models, along with the high demand for its quality pickups and SUVs, are likely to drive the company. We are also optimistic about the company\u2019s target to deliver on its\u00a0$2 billion net cost reduction program\u00a0by the end of this year.\u00a0To add to its strengths, GM had more than $33 billion in automotive liquidity as of Mar 31, 2024, ensuring resilience against economic cycles.\n\nGM\u2019s Ultium Drive system and battery plants\u00a0in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are likely to scale up its e-mobility prowess. However, recent comments by CEO Mary Barra have raised doubts over the company\u2019s EV production target of 1 million by 2025. Speaking about the slowdown in EV growth, Barra said, \u201cWe won\u2019t get to a million just because the market is not developing, but it will get there.\u201d\u00a0 High capital and R&D expenditure, challenges in its Cruise unit and stiff competition in China are further headwinds.\n\nLast Word\n\nWhile GM is attractively valued and has strong fundamentals, it may not be the right time to buy the stock. The EV push has been a major tailwind for the stock but the recent comments by CEO Mary Barra have raised questions about the company's ambitious EV production goal. This could impact near-term sentiment. More details about GM's EV plans are expected when the company reports its second-quarter results on Jul 23. Therefore, it might be prudent to wait for the earnings report before making an investment decision.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Even better, JOBY expects to start commercial operations of its battery-electric air taxi by 2025.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that launch nearing, JOBY is a buy.\n\nFueling even more momentum is China, which has given flying car companies a green light for development.\u00a0According to\u00a0The Economist, Prime Minister Li Qiang mentioned the \u201clow altitude economy\u201d as a potential new engine for GDP growth.\u00a0Even better,\u00a0\u201cthe domestic market is now poised for an unprecedented boom,\u201d said eHang Holdings CEO Huazhi Hu in an earnings call.\n\nEven better, with the flying car boom just getting off the ground, JPMorgan predicts a potential $3 trillion market by 2040.\n\nAll of these could send flying car stocks sky-high.

Helping,\u00a0Morgan Stanley just upgraded the stock to an overweight rating with a $27.50 price target. Plus,\u00a0with China rolling out supportive policies for the low-altitude economy, \u201cthe domestic market is now poised for an unprecedented boom,\u201d said CEO Huazhi Hu, as I noted above.\n\nEven better, the company just received\u00a0certification for its EH216-S-passenger-carrying pilotless eVTOL aircraft from the Civil Aviation Administration of China. That now clears the way for the company to increase production and meet its backlog of orders.\n\nEarnings have been solid.

The\u00a0company also wants to commercialize flying cars by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nNow, at $8.40, XPEV is still a buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to XPeng affiliate\u00a0XPeng AeroHT, there are plans to start delivering flying cars to customers by 2026. And, according to company co-president Brian Gu, the cars should be available for pre-order this year, starting at $138,000 each.\n\nXPEV\u2019s upside is also being fueled by improving electric vehicle sales. In June, for example, the company said it delivered 10,668 Smart EVs, a 24% improvement year over year. For the first half of the year, it has now delivered 52,028 EVs, a 26% jump year over year.\n\nPlus, Citi analysts just raised their price target on XPEV to HK$32.20 from HK$29.90.

        "title": "Wall Street is divided on Tesla's future under a second Trump presidency",
        "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is throwing his support behind Donald Trump's presidential campaign, but a potential second term has left Wall Street split on whether it will be a boon or bust for the EV maker.\n\nAt the heart of the debate is the Biden-era $7,500 EV tax incentive. The former president, his VP pick J.D. Vance, and a number of their Republican colleagues have long opposed Biden's EV initiatives. Senator Vance introduced the Drive American Act last fall, aimed at eliminating over $100 billion in existing EV subsidies and replacing them with credits for gas or diesel-powered vehicles.\n\nHowever, a rollback in EV credits could help Tesla (TSLA) \u201cwiden the gap and technology lead\u201d over its rivals, Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives told me. The world's most valuable automaker is better positioned in an unsubsidized environment compared to younger EV companies that are burning through cash.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big advantage for Tesla and Elon Musk,\u201d Ives said, adding that Tesla\u2019s scale and scope is \u201cunmatched.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone on Wall Street is buying the argument that a Trump presidency is a positive for Tesla.\n\nGuggenheim\u2019s Ron Jewsikow told me he \u201cstruggles\u201d to see it as anything but negative, calling the EV tax credit a \u201ckey affordability enabler\u201d for Tesla.\n\nJewsikow also noted the risk of higher tariffs, as Tesla, like other auto manufacturers, uses Chinese-sourced batteries.\n\nWall Street is closely tracking Musk\u2019s support for Trump. Musk, who endorsed Trump shortly after the failed assassination attempt on July 13, wrote in a post on X that Trump's vice president pick is an \"excellent decision,\" later adding that a Trump-Vance ticket \"resounds with victory.\"\n\nHe also reportedly plans to pledge $45 million per month to support the former president's White House bid.\n\nI fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery pic.twitter.com/ZdxkF63EqF\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 13, 2024\n\nThroughout Trump\u2019s campaign, he has proposed implementing a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports, a move that would likely escalate the ongoing trade war. That\u2019s compared to the current administration\u2019s recent decision to raise the tariff rate to 25% for Chinese lithium-ion EV batteries and battery parts.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariff talk has caught the attention of others on Wall Street as analysts weigh the implications of a Trump presidency on the automotive sector beyond Tesla.\n\nRBC\u2019s Tom Narayan told me Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d behavior during his first four years in office has left the auto industry uneasy, and many automakers view his past threats as a potential challenge to their business if he were to be elected for a second term.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIn 2019 he threatened to put tariffs on Canadian aluminum and that scared everybody, but he never wound up doing it. And then he threatened to put tariffs on Europe. It\u2019s the erratic nature of threats that the auto industry does not like,\u201d Narayan said. A variety of Tesla vehicles are stored at a shopping mall parking lot of a closed movie theater Friday, June 21, 2024, in Scottsdale, Ariz. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nWhile the exact impact of a Trump presidency on Tesla is still murky, there\u2019s growing consensus that a second term will likely slow EV adoption and hurt the sector overall.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't necessarily sink Tesla's ship, but it does sink some ships. It\u2019s certainly negative for everyone,\u201d Jewsikow said.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Ives. \u201cTrump would be negative for Detroit and the EV transformation of GM (GM) and Ford (F),\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a major headwind for core EV players not named Tesla.\u201d\n\nThe debate around the election's impact comes amid shifting sentiment toward Tesla. Better-than-expected second quarter deliveries prompted an 11-day rally in the stock before shares briefly sold off this week on reports of the company delaying its robotaxi unveiling to the fall.\n\nThe stock is up 40% since the start of June.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "The market for electric vehicles and EV stocks and is going through a transition. Consumers have become frustrated by high prices, low battery range and a lack of charging infrastructure to support them. This has lead many people away from electric vehicles and towards gas-electric hybrids over the last 18 months. However, while growth in EV sales has slowed, the market is still expanding, according to industry data.\n\nCox Automotive reports that overall U.S. electric vehicle sales rose 11.3% year-over-year (YOY) in Q2. Electric cars and trucks accounted for 8% of all new cars sold in the U.S. during Q2, up from 7.2% the previous year. There are now more than 100 EV models available in the U.S. And, EV sales continue to expand faster than sales of gasoline-powered vehicles.\n\nThis is all to say that there are still investment opportunities to be found among electric vehicles. Here are three EV stocks that could grow your wealth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Cadillac car and SUV dealership. Cadillac offers a full line of gas and electric EV vehicles. GM stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nEV sales for General Motors (NYSE:GM) came roaring back in this year\u2019s second quarter. The Detroit automaker reported its best quarterly sales in nearly four years, boosted by a 40% increase in sales of its EV models. GM racked up sales of 696,086 vehicles, its highest number of units sold since Q4 of 2020.\n\nThe sales were driven higher by electric vehicles, with deliveries in Q2 rising 40% YOY to 21,930 units. While EVs still comprise only 3% of total sales, the growth seen in Q2 is encouraging for the company\u2019s long-term strategy to move away from gas-powered cars, trucks and SUVs. According to Cox Automotive, GM\u2019s Q2 sales outpaced the global automotive industry, putting the biggest U.S. motor vehicle manufacturer back on top.\n\nGM stock has risen 38% so far in 2024 and appears to have momentum.\n\nNio (NIO) NIO logo and the Nio's user center, NIO House. Retail display of store at downtown LCM mall daytime NIO is a Chinese electric car brand sales person and customers inside\n\nSource: Andy Feng / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a buy-the-dip candidate, look to Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE:NIO). The company\u2019s stock has taken a drubbing lately, having declined 41% so far this year. The shares now trade for less than $5, putting them in penny stock territory. While disappointing, there might be an opportunity with NIO stock. Especially as the automaker undertakes an aggressive turnaround strategy.\n\nIn recent days, Nio announced that its long-time CFO Steven Wei Feng has resigned from the company. His resignation was effective immediately. Feng is being replaced in the CFO role by Stanley Yu Qu, a company insider who has worked at Nio since 2016. His previous position at Nio was as a Senior Vice-President of Finance. Analysts claim to be encouraged by Qu\u2019s appointment as he has experience outside Nio having started his career at Lear Corp. (NYSE:LEA) and Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI).\n\nStory continues\n\nQu takes over the CFO role as Nio struggles with an electric vehicle price war in its home market. There have also been new tariffs imposed on Chinese EVs entering Europe. The turnaround will likely take time, but Nio remains a leading EV manufacturer in the world\u2019s biggest automotive market.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of EV stocks that have turned around, how about Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN)? The EV start-up company\u2019s stock has been on fire lately. This has been fueled by the announcement that Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) is investing up to $5 billion in Rivian\u2019s operations. In the month since the VW deal was announced, RIVN stock has gained 60%, outpacing just about every other stock in the market.\n\nDespite the increase in recent weeks, Rivian stock is still trading down 15% on the year and is 38% below its 52-week high. This means there is still an opportunity to take a position in the company\u2019s stock as it marches upwards. Prior to news of the Volkswagen cash infusion, RIVN stock had been badly beaten down on concerns about its cash burn and growing losses. The EV maker reported a net loss of $1.45 billion in this year\u2019s first quarter. All that seems like ancient history now thanks to VW riding to the rescue.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Lithium Stocks That Could Grow Your Wealth",
        "content": "Diving into lithium stocks during these challenging times for the underlying market may seem audacious. Recent data from TrendForce showed a substantial dip in lithium prices last month, spurred by the downstream battery sector\u2019s push to limit inventory. The demand for lithium salts has slowed substantially, and the short-term oversupply has resulted in the lowest prices of the year. Currently, the market sentiment towards lithium stocks remains bearish, making these stocks significantly undervalued.\n\nDespite the current slowdown, several industry experts anticipate a shift. Estimates suggest that by the end of 2025, the market could face a modest deficit of 40,000 to 60,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent. Moreover, this shortfall is likely to get even steeper, reaching 768,000 tonnes by 2030.\n\nHence, with that backdrop, it\u2019s an ideal time to invest in lithium stocks, anticipating substantial long-term growth in demand. These lithium stocks stand to benefit the most from the rebound, offering superb upside from their current prices.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLithium Stocks to Buy: Albemarle (ALB) lithium (LI) on the periodic table. top performing lithium stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is a heavyweight in the specialty chemicals arena, holding a dominant position in the lithium and bromine markets. With the expansion in the EV sphere over the past few years, ALB\u2019s focus has mostly been on its lithium mining operation.\n\nHowever, lithium carbonate prices have tumbled with the supply-demand deficit in the EV space, weighing down ALB stock. Despite the dip in spot prices, though, it\u2019s essential to look beyond these short-term fluctuations and recognize ALB stock\u2019s long-term growth runway.\n\nConcerns over the sustainability of lithium producers such as ALB have been overly exaggerated. As discussed earlier, the recent lithium price correction should not overshadow the long-term bull case for ALB and its peers. Moreover, following the dip, ALB stock trades at an attractive 2x forward sales estimates, roughly 50% below the sector median. Also, considering the inevitable rebound in commodities like lithium, Albemarle\u2019s positioning in the market is particularly promising.\n\nArcadium Lithium (ALTM) Graphic of Lithium scientific symbol (Li) in the shape of a big white gear with construction equipment and mountain around it. favorite Lithium stocks\n\nSource: GrAl / Shutterstock.com\n\nArcadium Lithium (NYSE:ALTM) is an innovative force in the lithium space, making waves with advanced extraction and processing technologies. Moreover, with substantial lithium reserves, ALTM continues to expand its reach.\n\nIn the first quarter (Q1), the firm demonstrated a robust 3% growth in sales to $261.2 million, with its EPS of 6 cents, surpassing estimates by a couple of cents. Furthermore, it achieved an average realized lithium hydroxide and carbonate prices above $20,000 per metric ton, solidifying its financial strength.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead, ALTM\u2019s future appears remarkably bright. It\u2019s on course to realize roughly $60 to $80 million in synergies and cost reductions this year. Additionally, its ambitious expansion plans involve taking production capacity to 170,000 LCEs by 2026. Moreover, analysts forecast a healthy revenue increase of 34% to $1.19 billion this year and an even more staggering growth to $1.61 billion by 2025. Hence, ALTM is poised for significant growth, making it a standout investment opportunity in the lithium market.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is one of the most talked-about lithium stocks, with tremendous asset potential. Moreover, over the past few years, it has acquired substantial financial backing for its projects. This firm foundation positions it well for superb upside as the market sentiment for lithium improves.\n\nLAC is known for its famous Thacker Pass asset, boasting an impressive after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion. Additionally, initiating both production phases could generate an average annual EBITDA of $2 billion.\n\nFurthermore, in March, it secured a conditional commitment for a $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy, supplemented by a $650 million liquidity boost in two tranches from General Motors (NYSE:GM). Therefore, the company has the impetus to take things up a notch with its business, positioning it for substantial future returns. Moreover, despite more than a 50% drop in its stock price year-to-date, the intrinsic value of Lithium Americas\u2019 assets remains undiminished.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The EV market is heating up in both domestic and international markets. While the EV sector in the U.S. has a projected compound annual growth rate of 15.5% until 2032, the international market is looking at a slightly higher target of 15.9%. This makes this a highly lucrative sector \u2013 and also one several companies want to enter.\n\nThis fragmentation has had a clear impact recently. Many were shocked when it was revealed that Tesla Motors\u2018 (NASDAQ:TSLA) market share in the U.S. fell to below 50%. This fragmentation is good for both consumers and investors \u2013 a higher supply will lead to a lower average price and more options for all types of investors.\n\nA larger number of companies in the EV space will also allow investors to diversify their EV assets. Here are three EV stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a global automotive company that designs, manufactures, and sells vehicles and vehicle parts. In the EV market, GM has made significant strides with its commitment to an all-electric future. The company aims to launch 30 new global EVs by 2025.\n\nRegarding quarterly revenue growth, GM\u2019s revenue was up in the first quarter by 7.6% from a year ago, reaching $43.1 billion. Net income of $2.98 billion was up 24.4% from a year ago. GM stock has great financials, consistently beating earnings per share predictions over the past year.\n\nFor the full year, GM increased its guidance to range of $12.5 billion and $14.5 billion in adjusted earnings, from a previous range of $12 billion to $14 billion.\n\nRecently, GM stock has been up 5.8% for the past week. Factors influencing GM stock value include a $500 million federal grant to enhance EV production at the GM Lansing Grand River plant in Michigan and a $390 million investment by GM supplier Gestamp to upgrade its Michigan-based manufacturing facilities. All this positions GM as one of the best EV stocks to buy.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer specializing in premium smart SUVs. The company emphasizes extended-range electric vehicles to alleviate range anxiety. Li Auto integrates advanced technology and luxurious design to provide safe, convenient, and comfortable mobility solutions.\n\nIt\u2019s currently trading under $21, and is up over 9% over the last month. The company has reported troubling earnings lately, missing its last quarter estimate by a huge margin of 26 cents per share. Revenue in the first quarter was $3.6 billion, up 36.4% over last year, but the company reported a loss of $81 million. Recent reports indicate positive analyst ratings, suggesting an average price target of $34.95.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has announced plans to introduce new EV models, including a pure electric vehicle, which is expected to drive future growth. Additionally, Li Auto has been ramping up its infrastructure with new manufacturing facilities and increased development in research and development. The stock\u2019s significant upside potential and the company\u2019s strategic initiatives make it a definite EV stock to buy.\n\nNissan Motor Co. (NSANY) Closeup logo nissan car with soft-focus and over light in the background\n\nSource: Memory Stockphoto / Shutterstock\n\nNissan Motor (OTCMKTS:NSANY) is one of the world\u2019s most renowned automobile companies. It operates internationally, although it is based in Japan. Nissan also operates under the Infiniti brand. While it has specialized in internal combustion engine technology, it is making moves into the EV space, especially with the sale of lithium-ion batteries.\n\nNisson is trading over the counter at $7 at this writing. Analysts have given this company a \u201cbuy\u201d rating, and an average growth target of $7.85. This is due to its strong technical and fundamental aspects. It has seen a quarterly revenue boost of 13.5% from a year ago, and has a profit margin of 3.36%, lower than the sector average. However, the company has large stockpiles of cash on hand, sitting at $2.02 trillion. This stockpile will allow the company to invest in research and development.\n\nWe have seen evidence of this recently. It has been reported that the company is collaborating with Honda (NYSE:HMC) in reference to EV charging networks and software. This will result in shared use of this technology. This creates a strong case to invest in NSANY for its future EV plans.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In the first quarter of 2024, the U.S. economy grew at a strong, annualized pace of 2.4% above inflation. And multiple experts are predicting that the economy will add another 2% of growth above inflation during the current quarter. In this environment, the demand for solar panels, personal computers, data center components, construction components and automobiles, should continue to climb. This bodes well for the transportation companies that move those products around the country. It\u2019s true that economic growth is beginning to slow thanks to households\u2019 reduced savings and the lagged effects of interest rate increases. But with the Fed likely to cut rates in September, multiple sectors, including housing, travel, commercial real estate and automobiles, will be rejuvenated, causing the financial results of many transportation companies to get a big lift. Here are three transport stocks to buy if you want to exploit the latter trend.\n\nGE Aerospace (GE) image of a plane flying in the sky representing airline stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) is purely focused on developing components for airplanes and servicing them.\n\nThe company is clearly benefiting from strong travel trends and many airlines\u2019 increased spending on the acquisition of airplanes. Additionally, the company\u2019s defense business is getting a boost from many nations\u2019 higher military outlays.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the first quarter, GE Aerospace\u2019s top line surged 11% YOY to $16.1 billion, while its orders jumped 14% YOY to $20.1 billion. Moreover, the firm raised its full-year operating profit guidance to $6.2-$6.6 billion from $6-$6.5 billion previously.\n\nGoldman Sachs says that the company has \u201climited competition\u201d and is well-positioned to continue to benefit from the \u201cmaintenance-intensive\u201d nature of airplane engines.\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect the company\u2019s earnings per share to jump to $4.09 in 2024 and $5.06 in 2025, up from $2.81 in 2023.\n\nWestinghouse Air Brake (WAB) Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation (Wabtec) logo on a phone screen in front of the Wabtec website. WAB stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nWestinghouse Air Brake (NYSE:WAB) makes train components, including railcars. The company delivered strong Q1 financial results, as its top line jumped 14% YOY to $2.5 billion. Moreover, its earnings per share, excluding certain items, soared 47.7% YOY to $1.89. Also importantly, Westinghouse increased its adjusted EPS guidance to between $7-$7.40 from $6.78. At the midpoint of that range, the company\u2019s EPS would jump 21.6% this year.\n\nIn Q1, rail carloads in the U.S. climbed 1.8% YOY after increasing 2.8% YOY in Q4. During the weeks of July 3 and July 10, U.S. weekly rail traffic climbed 3.9% and 3.3% YOY, respectively. And according to Seeking Alpha columnist Stephen Simpson, the average railcar in America is 27.4 years old. As a result, many rail operators will probably have to buy a multitude of railcars in the coming months and years, lifting Westinghouse\u2019s financial outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoing forward, Westinghouse should also benefit from the U.S. government\u2019s large outlays on passenger railroads and California\u2019s decision to ban locomotives more than 23 years old as of 2030. Finally, the company should get a lift from interest rate cuts later this year. Those reductions will likely increase the demand for raw materials used in building houses, office buildings and automobiles, lifting the demand for railcars.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough General Motors\u2019 (NYSE:GM) deliveries only rose 0.6% YOY last quarter, there was a great deal to like about the company\u2019s results beyond the headline number.\n\nSpecifically, the firm\u2019s share of the lucrative U.S. pickup truck category rose 1.6 percentage points to a huge 44.5%. Even more impressively, its share of mid-sized trucks, which also carry high margins, jumped 12.5 percentage points to a robust 28.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, the automaker\u2019s strategy for EVs appears to be working as it delivered a record 21,930 EVs in Q2, representing a YOY increase of 40%. Clearly, consumers are pleased with the many new electric models that GM has rolled out.\n\nAnd the Street has become much more enamored with GM stock in recent months as the shares have climbed over 36% so far this year.\n\nFinally, the company should get a big lift from interest rate cuts which will make its vehicles much more affordable.\n\nGiven GM\u2019s strong Q2 performance and its multiple, positive catalysts, it\u2019s one of the best transport stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "Big Auto Eyes $2B in Govt Grants to Boost EV Production",
        "content": "The Biden administration is awarding nearly $2B in grants to General Motors (NYSE:GM), Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) and other carmakers to help restart or expand electric vehicle manufacturing and assembly sites in eight states.\n\nThe Energy Department will issue grants totaling $1.7 billion to create or retain thousands of union jobs and support auto-based communities in the three presidential battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia as well Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nAccording to Biden, the grants-- paid for by the landmark IRA of 2022--will help deliver on Washington\u2019s commitment to ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. \u201cEven as our competitors invest heavily in electric vehicles, these grants ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive--and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations,\u2019\u2019 she added.\n\nLast week, GM announced it has received a $500 million federal grant to help the company convert an assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan to produce EVs. GM has already invested over $12 billion in its North American EV manufacturing and supply chain since 2020.\n\nRelated: Houthis Showcase Drone Boat as Another Merchant Ship Falls Victim\n\nThe grants were hotly contested, with the DoE revealing it received four times as many applicants as grant recipients. DoE says all projects that were awarded funding currently employ Americans working in union jobs in the U.S.\n\nThe selected projects will create more than 2,900 jobs and help ensure that about 15,000 union workers are retained across all 11 facilities, the White House has said. According to the DoE, the new grants complement $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing since Biden took office.\n\nThe UAW has, however, warned that a too rapid transition from ICE to EVs could put thousands of jobs at risk in key states such as Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana.\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain has applauded the announcement, saying the grants and loans \"makes clear to employers that the EV transition must include strong union partnerships with the high pay and safety standards that generations of UAW members have fought for and won.\"\n\nImpact On Oil Demand\n\nWith the year at the midpoint, the\u00a0EV boom shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nStory continues\n\nEV sales globally have now hit 18% of all new vehicle sales, with BEV sales up by 14% YoY in April, while plugin hybrids jumped 51% YoY. A big driver of the EV megatrend is falling costs, with Tesla Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) most affordable model now $6,500 cheaper than its ICE peer, the cheapest BMW 3 Series, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Gartner has predicted that EVs will be cheaper to produce than ICE vehicles of the same size in only three years, thanks in large part to improvements in manufacturing methods with production costs dropping faster than battery costs.\n\n\u201cNew OEM incumbents want to heavily redefine the status quo in automotive. They brought new innovations that simplify production costs such as centralized vehicle architecture or the introduction of gigacastings that help reduce manufacturing cost and assembly time, which legacy automakers had no choice to adopt to survive, \u201dPedro Pacheco, vice president of research at Gartner, has said.\n\nRapid EV adoption has elicited dire predictions for the oil sector. Last year, Bloomberg predicted that global demand for road fuel will peak in 2027 at 49 million barrels per day driven by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles, ever-improving fuel efficiency, and shared mobility. Just a week ago, British Oil & Gas giant BP Plc (NYSE:BP) predicted that global oil demand will peak next year while wind and solar capacity will continue to grow rapidly.\n\nIn its latest edition of its annual Energy Outlook, BP has published a study of the evolution of the global energy system to 2050.\u00a0 BP has modeled its predictions on two key scenarios: The Current Trajectory and Net Zero. BP has predicted that oil demand will peak by 2025 at around 102 million barrels per day (bpd) under both scenarios.\n\nHowever, the rate of decline thereafter will be determined primarily by the pace of falling oil use in road transport. In the Current Trajectory, BP sees oil consumption gradually declining over the second half of the outlook to around 75 million bpd in 2050. The drop is, however, much more pronounced in Net Zero, with demand falling somewhere between 25 million and 30 million bpd by 2050.\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\n\nU.S. Oil, Gas Drilling Activity Continues To Drop Suriname\u2019s Mega Oil Boom Is Back on Track Brent Tops $86 on Hopes of Fed Cut in September\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The market\u2019s breadth broadened last week as yields fell on a cooler inflation report. In June, the Consumer Price Index increased 3% year-on-year and declined 0.1% month-over-month, raising the prospects of a rate cut in September. In response, there was a rotation out of the Magnificent Seven into the rest of the market. If this rotation keeps up, it\u2019s an opportune time to consider some bargain stocks to buy now.\n\nAlthough rate cuts improve stock return prospects, being selective at these levels is vital. The momentum in information technology and communication sectors has carried the markets so far. But with valuations in some of the year-to-date leaders stretched, it\u2019s time to rotate into cheaper stocks. Remember, we are headed into the seasonally weak August to October period, with the U.S. elections likely to increase volatility.\n\nTherefore, seek safety in these bargain stocks to buy now. Due to their lower valuations, they offer downside protection in case volatility increases. Moreover, if market breadth improves, they have substantial upside as they catch up to their growth counterparts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDevon Energy (DVN) The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.\n\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the value sectors with many bargain stocks to buy now is energy. The sector trades at a next-twelve-month price-to-earnings of 12.1 versus the S&P 500\u2019s 21.6. Even better, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is cheaper at a 8 times forward P/E multiple.\n\nAfter shedding its Barnett Shale, Canadian interests and Enlink Midstream interest, Devon is now a U.S. shale-focused exploration and production company. Today, it\u2019s one of the lowest-cost producers with prime assets in the Bakken and Delaware Basin. All in all, Devon has exposure to five U.S. shale basins that guarantee a 17-year inventory life.\n\nMoreover, the oil company is still enhancing its assets. On July 8, it announced a $5 billion acquisition of the Williston Basin business of Grayson Mill Energy. The deal adds a higher margin production mix and makes Devon one of the largest U.S. oil producers, with estimated production of 765,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day. Furthermore, the deal is immediately accretive to free cash flow and earnings.\n\nSince the deal is accretive, Devon increased its buyback through mid-year 2026 by 67% to $5 billion. Also, the deal is accretive to its fixed-plus-variable dividend payout which means an increase to the latest $0.35 per share payout. This oil producer is cheap and has an impressive shareholder return program; it\u2019s a buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, General Motors (NYSE:GM) delivered a net income of $10.1 billion and adjusted EBIT of $12.4 billion. Despite these amazing profits, GM stock is priced like a business in decline. At 5 times forward earnings, it priced like a distressed stock, yet it grew net income by 5.2% in 2023. What\u2019s more, GM is seeing growth opportunities in EVs.\n\nThe main reason to be excited about General Motors is its capital return program at these attractive levels. The auto maker announced a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase in November 2023. Consequently, on June 11, its board approved a $6 billion buyback to allow opportunistic repurchases once the accelerated plan is exhausted.\n\nThese plans will shrink share count by over 25% and are accretive to earnings. Management estimates repurchases of $1.4 billion and $300 million in dividends in the first half of 2024. According to Oakmark\u2019s Bill Nygren, if GM maintains 2023 net income levels, EPS will go up by 40% due to these repurchases.\n\nBesides the accretive repurchases, green shoots are emerging in the EV business. Q2 new energy vehicles (NEVs) sales in China rose to over 143,000 units, a 24.1% YOY increase. With this combination of growth and value, General Motors is one of the top bargain stocks to buy now.\n\nKilroy Realty (KRC) Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room. commercial real estate\n\nSource: GaudiLab / Shutterstock\n\nKilroy Realty (NYSE:KRC) is one of the bargain stocks to buy now in the real estate sector. This REIT develops and operates mixed-use, class A office and life science real estate in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, San Diego, Seattle and Austin. Although the West Coast office market remains stressed, office occupancy rates are increasing, boosting net operating income.\n\nMoreover, a focus on the rapidly growing life sciences market is a key differentiator. Due to drug innovation and an aging population, this segment is well-positioned for growth. Kilroy is increasing life science tenants through projects such as Kilroy Oyster Point.\n\nIn Q1 2024 results, management noted improving demand trends. First, the REIT recorded the highest first quarter leasing volume since 2017. Regarding life science demand in the Bay Area and South San Francisco, they highlighted that demand was tracking at 2.5 million square feet, a 25% increase from Q4 2023.\n\nWith occupancy in office improving and the life science portfolio driving growth, Kilroy is one of the bargain stocks to buy now. A forward price-to-funds from operations of 8 and a 6% dividend yield is too attractive to pass over.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Automobiles have been around for more than a century and are still at the core of our daily transportation, even as the industry constantly evolves. Automobiles are at the heart of current and future transportation, from traditional vehicles to hybrid cars to electric vehicles to flying cars in the air.\n\nThe year\u2019s first half proved to be a good start for the automobile industry. As demand for automobiles has increased, more investors are looking to buy automobile stocks.\n\nWhen everyone is actively looking for an auto stock to invest in, the market can soon get overly saturated. Before it does and this ideal period for auto investment goes away, investors should keep an eye out and find an undervalued auto stock. Thus, below are the three most undervalued auto stocks to buy in July 2024 that will bring investors a major fortune.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nToyota (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor the past four consecutive years, Toyota (NYSE:TM) has been the largest auto company in the world. Last year, it was the only automaker to sell over 10 million vehicles. It has dominated the Asia-Pacific for decades and is a close second manufacturer in the North American market after Ford (NYSE:F).\n\nIn the changing automobile market, Toyota has emphasized the importance of both hybrid and electric vehicles. While some of its competitors were quick to fully go electric or invest a hefty sum of money into EVs, Toyota\u2019s strategy has always prioritized hybrid models over fully electric vehicles. This unique policy gives Toyota an edge over other auto companies when pure electric vehicles struggle. Out of the 11.2 million vehicles Toyota sold in 2023, a third of its sales came from hybrid cars.\n\nIn addition to great sales and market dominance, Toyota is relatively undervalued, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.33x. Now is the perfect time for investors to buy Toyota.\n\nBYD Company (BYDDF) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) is now the largest electric vehicle company globally, beating major competitors like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY). It owns a little less than 20% of the industry\u2019s market share. This Chinese EV powerhouse has established itself as the cream of the crop with active delivery, consistent performance, and constant improvements.\n\nLast month, BYD recorded another all-time high performance. It sold 341,658 new energy vehicles (NEV), which is an outstanding 35% increase from the same period last year. Sales this June contributed to a larger all-time high in second-quarter sales. This was also a 40% increase in sales year over year. The company also sealed a major $1 billion deal to open an EV factory in Turkey, which will help BYD produce nearly 150,000 vehicles annually. In addition to its dominance in the Asia-Pacific market, deals like these show that BYD is constantly making efforts to expand beyond its domestic market.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith such strong and consistent sales performance, BYD will continue to keep the top EV maker spot for an extended period of time, and now it is the cheapest price investors will be able to buy BYD.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors has been a top player in the auto industry since its founding in 1908.\n\nIn April, GM authorized a $6 billion share repurchase, another major stock buyback authorization after the $10 billion authorization in November 2023. In addition, the automobile company increased its dividend payment by 33% from 9 cents to 12 cents per share.\n\nAdditionally, GM\u2019s 2024 second-quarter sales were impressive. It sold almost 700,000 vehicles, GM\u2019s highest quarterly sales record since 2024.\n\nWhile EVs only make up less than 4% of all auto sales for GM, its EV sales are up by 40% compared to the previous quarter, a positive indication that GM is adapting to the global shift toward electric vehicles.\n\nFor those looking for an undervalued auto stock, GM is an excellent choice. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is 5.04x.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andy Kim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why General Motors Company (GM) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "General Motors (GM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this an automotive manufacturer have returned +4.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which General Motors belongs, has gained 31.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nGeneral Motors is expected to post earnings of $2.67 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +39.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $9.43 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +22.8%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.54 indicates a change of +1.1% from what General Motors is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of General Motors, the consensus sales estimate of $44.94 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.4%. The $176.44 billion and $177.49 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.7% and +0.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGeneral Motors reported revenues of $43.01 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.6%. EPS of $2.62 for the same period compares with $2.21 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.29 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.18%. The EPS surprise was +25.96%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGeneral Motors is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Many of the most undervalued stocks also pay sizable dividends.\n\nLong-term investment success often depends on uncovering these hidden gems and\u00a0then\u00a0holding them for very long periods of time.\u00a0And even\u00a0though the stock market is currently at an all-time high and many stocks are splitting after doubling or tripling their share price, there are still\u00a0bargains to be found.\n\nHere are the three most undervalued sleeper stocks to buy in July 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDelta Air Lines (DAL) Delta airlines aircraft interior full of passengers. Why are so many flights overbooked?\n\nSource: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.com\n\nA buy-the-dip opportunity\u00a0looks\u00a0to have formed in\u00a0Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) after the company\u2019s\u00a0justreleased second quarter earnings.\u00a0DAL stock fell 7% after the air carrier issued forward guidance that fell short of Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\u00a0Executives forecast record revenue for the\u00a0current third quarter due to\u00a0strong\u00a0summer travel.\u00a0But the outlook still missed analysts\u2019 lofty estimates, sending Delta stock lower.\n\nDAL stock is now down 10% over the last 12 months and trading 30% below its pre-pandemic levels of five years ago. Delta stock looks\u00a0super\u00a0cheap right now trading at just five times future earnings estimates. Other reasons to remain bullish on the long-term outlook for the airline are its quarterly dividend payment of 15 cents a share and the fact that Delta is the\u00a0most profitable U.S.-based airline after the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nAlso, Delta noted in its Q2\u00a0print\u00a0that corporate travel continues to recover from pandemic lows and\u00a0that it expects corporate travel\u00a0to continue rising going forward.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutomotive giant\u00a0General Motors (NYSE:GM) has enjoyed a nice rally this year with its share price having gained 33%. Yet even with that big move higher, GM stock is still trading at a\u00a0rock bottom\u00a0price-earnings ratio of five times future earnings estimates. This makes the automaker\u2019s stock look undervalued even as it trades near a 52-week high. Investors who buy the stock now are getting it a very cheap valuation.\n\nNow\u00a0looks to be\u00a0a great time to buy General Motors stock with the company on an upswing.\u00a0GM\u00a0just\u00a0reported its\u00a0best quarterly sales in nearly four years, driven by a 40% increase in sales of its electric vehicles (EVs). In mid-June, GM announced a new $6 billion stock buyback program.

Trading at 20 times future earnings, UPS stock is not as cheap as Delta or GM. But it\u2019s about as low as the company\u2019s P/E ratio\u00a0has been\u00a0since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. UPS also pays a monster dividend of $1.63 per share, giving it a yield of 4.72%.\n\nUPS stock has taken a hit over the last year due to a decline in e-commerce shipments and a\u00a0costly new labor agreement with its workers. That said, good things are also happening at the company. UPS has struck a deal to become the primary air cargo provider for the U.S. Postal Service, replacing rival Federal Express (NYSE:FDX). The Postal Service contract had paid FedEx about $1.75 billion a year. UPS just sold its third-party logistics business to RXO (NYSE:RXO) for $1 billion.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either\u00a0directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either\u00a0directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nIf the fact that Tesla bulls have a religious-like commitment to the stock isn\u2019t clear from social media, it sure is from its financials.\n\nTesla\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio, which divides next year\u2019s estimated earnings per share by the current share price, is 97.1x, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nOur Chart of the Week compares this figure to its peers, and it\u2019s striking.\n\nThough Nvidia has gotten most of the valuation attention during this year\u2019s bull run, Tesla\u2019s valuation has investors paying almost double: Nvidia\u2019s forward P/E stands around 48.5x. And though Nvidia\u2019s stock is up 800% since 2023 and nearly 200% so far this year, its earnings have exploded too.\n\nThe rest of Tesla and Nvidia\u2019s Magnificent peers are all trading at valuations above the S&P 500\u2019s average of around 22x. Then again, these companies have been the source of most of the market\u2019s earnings growth in recent quarters.\n\nBut there\u2019s always more to the story in markets.\n\nIn a note this week, DataTrek\u2019s Nicholas Colas wrote about how these numbers, while useful, can be broken down further by looking at how much of a stock\u2019s valuation comes from present earnings and how much comes from what is essentially an analytics version of hopes and dreams.\n\nColas calculates that around 45% of the valuation of the S&P 500 as a whole comes from current earnings, with the rest coming from the historically backed optimism that earnings will continue to grow.\n\nAnd if Tesla is simply more expensive than its Mag Seven peers, it's in a different stratosphere compared to its automaker peers, with GM and Ford trading at 5.1x and 6.5x next year\u2019s earnings, respectively. The legacy automakers' discount to the market is due to concerns about how well they\u2019d fare in a downturn.\n\n\u201cAnd then we get to Tesla, where 91% of its valuation is based on future earnings growth,\u201d Colas wrote. \u201cThat tells us this is a faith-based stock rather than one whose valuation is grounded in near-term fundamentals.\u201d\n\nWith expectations for future earnings so high, it\u2019s obvious that investors are banking on its robotaxi thesis as a paradigm shift for the company \u2014 and likely not the only shift to come.\n\nBut we\u2019d also be wise to use care when it comes to valuations.\n\nCaveats that accompany pronouncements about what\u2019s over- and undervalued often don\u2019t really matter. In the aggregate, valuation norms are more likely to hold over time: The S&P 500\u2019s average forward P/E is around 19x. In the specific, the range of outcomes is much wider.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll-time highs often follow all-time highs, and history is littered with both the losses and missed gains of investors who placed too much weight on whether a company was \u201covervalued\u201d by the book \u2014 and got steamrolled by inertia and sentiment.\n\nEspecially by a Tesla.\n\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

        "content": "Cars are here to stay. They are arguably the most important form of transportation for billions of people and have been so for decades. Almost certainly they will hold that position for decades to come. However, this vitality is not expressed as much as it should be in the stock market. Some car companies have valuations the same as their yearly revenue, showing that investors do not have high expectations for the future.\n\nBelow are three auto stocks that are heavily undervalued that investors should get their hands on.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is a Chinese EV company dominating the market but is unfairly undervalued. A key competitive edge they possess is the range of their EVs. Using their range extenders, they make their EVs more accessible and easier to use, because they are more convenient and can be used by customers far away from chargers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company is using its earnings to start new initiatives. Li recently announced plans to invest more than 6 billion yuan to build 5,000 charging stations, opening new lines of revenue. At the same Li Auto constantly creates new and improved EV models, most recently launching the Li L6.\n\nLooking at Li Auto\u2019s financials, they also back up the buy thesis. The company should be valued higher than $22 billion, which is low considering its tremendous growth. Last year Li\u2019s revenue grew to $17.4 billion, an impressive 173%. In the most recent quarter, revenue growth was only 36%, but still very impressive. At the same time, Li Auto is profitable and has been for a long time. This makes the company worth more as it makes it easier to keep growing without investor money and debt, while also providing it with a shield against bankruptcy.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is an American giant that is trading at a market cap near its yearly revenue, showing high potential for an increase in valuation. A key reason for this valuation is because of a consensus among investors that gas-fueled cars will not be popular in the future. GM solved this by heavily investing in its EV segment.\n\nIn 2023 alone, the company delivered over 75,000 EVs and expects to produce between 200,000 and 300,000 EVs just in 2024. Additionally, General Motors is investing $35 billion in EV cars through 2024. That will help it reach economies of scale and beat most smaller companies that could not fathom spending that much on development.\n\nGM is a buy based on its financials.\u00a0 In just 2023, the company sold a staggering 6.2 million cars worldwide, a number is 4% larger than the year-ago figure and equivalent to 7.1% of all vehicles sold globally. It also equates to nearly $140 billion in revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile costs are high in the auto industry, GM has strong margins that are generally around 7%, which gives the company massive profits to invest in R&D and setting up the company to thrive in the future by investing in EVs. They also have over $25 billion in cash, which protects them from negative economic downturns and allows them to keep growing.\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS: BYDDY) sells more EVs than any other manufacturer in the world. It recently took the title from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and owns roughly 18% of the global EV market. Despite this dominance, the company is valued at just a fraction of Tesla. BYD trades for approximately $100 billion compared to Tesla at $791 billion.\n\nThe company has many advantages to its competitors, too. Among them are its vertical integration, the fact it makes its own computer chips and also has lithium mines for battery production. BYD also continuously introduces successful models. It just developed a competitive hybrid car that can drive over 2,000 kilometers without stopping. It is also expanding its marketing. BYD became one of the main sponsors of the UEFA Euros, one of the most-watched sporting events internationally.\n\nBYD\u2019s financials make the company a strong buy. They are making a profit with a strong margin of around 4% versus most other EV manufacturers that lose money. However, where the EV maker experienced periods of tremendous sales growth last year of as much as 68%, sales are dramatically slowing.\n\nIn the first quarter, BYD sales rose just 2.3% year-over-year. The rest of the EV industry also got caught by the slowdown. Investors need to go in eyes wide open. Despite that, the company remains the dominant EV carmaker and is only becoming more so. It shows the market is severely undervaluing BYD.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tomas Levani did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 High-Risk Stocks Worth a Gamble for Multibagger Returns",
        "content": "I would never recommend that investors go overboard on high-risk stocks. At the same time, it\u2019s important to remember that millionaires are not made by investing in low-beta stocks. For young investors, there needs to be some brave portfolio allocation that delivers multibagger returns in relatively quick time.\n\nDepending on the age of an investor and risk-taking ability, I would recommend 10% to 20% exposure to high-risk stocks. When I talk about risk, it does not imply speculative stocks. The idea is to consider exposure to early-stage businesses or growth stocks with positive industry tailwinds. However, it\u2019s important to avoid stocks with a poor balance sheet even if industry tailwinds exist.\n\nThe high-risk stocks discussed in this column have the potential to deliver 10x to 20x returns within the next five years. While it\u2019s important to regularly review business developments, holding patiently is the key to massive wealth creation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium has remained in a sustained downtrend and this has translated into a meltdown in the best of lithium stocks. The sector looks deeply undervalued and there can be multibagger stories when lithium recovers. One stock that deserves a place in the portfolio is Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC).\n\nThere seems to be extreme fear with LAC stock having plunged by almost 60% for year-to-date. However, the underlying lithium asset exists and is a likely cash flow machine. Talking about the undervaluation, Lithium Americas trades at a market valuation of $550 million. In comparison, the company\u2019s Thacker Pass asset has an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion.\n\nAnother point to note is that the first phase of construction of the asset requires a capital expenditure of $2.93 billion. With the loan commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy, cash infusion by General Motors (NYSE:GM), and the recent equity dilution, Lithium Americas is fully financed. As the construction progresses and with the likelihood of lithium trending higher from oversold levels, LAC stock is positioned to surge.\n\nMarathon Digital (MARA) In this photo illustration, the Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong high-risk crypto stocks to buy, Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) looks attractive. The Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miner trades at a forward P/E of 23.2. Considering the expansion plans, valuations are attractive.\n\nThere are two catalysts for multibagger returns in MARA stock. First, Bitcoin trading at new highs in the coming years. This seems likely with limited supply and wider adoption of digital assets. Further, expansionary policies are likely to support a bull market in cryptocurrencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, Marathon has some ambitious growth plans that\u2019s backed by strong fundamentals. As of May, the miner reported an average operational hash rate of 25.7EH/s. This represents a year-on-year growth of 106% in hash rate capacity. Marathon is targeting to achieve capacity of 50EH/s by the end of the year. This is likely to translate into stellar revenue and cash flow upside.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that as of May, Marathon reported a cash buffer (including digital assets) of $1.5 billion. High financial flexibility will allow the company to pursue aggressive expansion beyond 2024. Last month, Marathon also announced the commencement of Kaspa (KAS-USD) mining to diversify its portfolio of digital assets.\n\nArcher Aviation (ACHR) Person holding cellphone with logo of American eVTOL aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s expected that the flying car industry will be worth $29 billion by 2030. Further, the market size is expected to swell to $1 trillion by 2040. It goes without saying that early movers in the industry with the right execution can be massive wealth creators.\n\nArcher Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) looks attractive among eVTOL companies. ACHR stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months and a breakout is imminent. The reason being that Archer is on-track to commercialize its eVTOL in the U.S. in 2025.\n\nI must mention at the onset that investors and strategic partners in Archer include Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) and United Airlines (NYSE:UAL). This underscores the potential the company holds.\n\nBesides operations in the United States, the flying car company has stitched local partnerships in UAE, India, and Korea. Over the next 24 to 30 months, Archer is likely to have healthy geographic presence. This will support stellar growth in 2025 and beyond. The company is already constructing its manufacturing facility to scale-up eVTOL production capabilities.\n\nCronos (CRON) scientist checking organic hemp wild plants in a cannabis weed commercial greenhouse. Concept of herbal alternative medicine, cbd oil, pharmaceutical industry. Cannabis stocks, FLGC stocks\n\nSource: Chokniti-Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nCannabis stock can be massive value creators if the global regulatory environment continues to turn friendly. Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) is among the most undervalued stocks to consider. If the business continues to progress in the right direction, 20x returns seem likely within five years.\n\nOne reason to like Cronos is a robust cash buffer of $855 million. The cannabis company has been conservative in utilizing its cash. Once the regulatory environment is clearer, I expect some big acquisitions.\n\nOn the organic growth front, Cronos has been making progress in the last few quarters. Earlier, the company was focused on Canada and Israel. However, Cronos has entered the new markets of Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. This is likely to support growth acceleration.\n\nRecently, Cronos announced a $51 million secured non-revolving credit facility to GrowCo (50% ownership) to fund facility expansion. The financing will help GrowCo to address the increased global market demand for high-quality cannabis flower.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) stock traded at highs of $47.3 earlier this year. There has been a steep correction from those levels and LI stock is near 52-week lows. I see this as a golden opportunity to accumulate. LI stock looks massively undervalued at a forward P/E of 18.4.\n\nThere are two important reasons for the steep correction. First, the EV company has revised its growth estimates downwards for the financial year. Further, tariff on Chinese EVs by the European Union has impacted sentiments. It\u2019s however worth noting that Li Auto is currently focused only on China.\n\nAmong the positives, Li Auto delivered 108,581 vehicles in Q2, which was higher by 25.5% on a year-on-year basis. Deliveries growth has therefore remained healthy.\n\nFurther, Li Auto ended Q1 with a strong cash buffer of $13.7 billion. This provides ample flexibility to invest in technology and product development. The Chinese EV player is targeting to launch level 3 self-driving technology in 2025. A possible expansion in the Middle-East might also be on the cards.\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US sports betting company DraftKings Inc. (DKNG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nDraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) is another high-risk, but attractive growth stock to buy. The company offers iGaming and online sports betting (OSB) in multiple states in the U.S. With a big addressable market, I believe that DraftKings is likely to remain in a high-growth trajectory. Further, as EBITDA margin expands, it\u2019s likely that DKNG stock will surge higher.\n\nTo put things into perspective, the OSB and iGaming market in the U.S. was $20 billion in 2023. The market is expected to grow at $30 billion (existing states) by 2028. Clearly, there is a big opportunity for DraftKings and this will ensure stellar top-line growth. I must add here that potential expansion in Europe is a catalyst for growth acceleration.\n\nAnother point to note is that DraftKings reported EBITDA loss of $151 million for 2023. For the current year, the company expects to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $500 million. Further, DraftKings has guided for adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion for 2026 and 2028 respectively. Clearly, with revenue growth, the business is likely to be a cash flow machine.\n\nIAMGOLD Corporation (IAG) An image of multiple gold bars. Gold prices\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLet\u2019s end the discussion with a penny stock that holds immense promise. IAMGOLD (NYSE:IAG) stock has surged by 55% in the last 12 months. However, the gold miner looks attractive at a forward P/E of 14.3. Fresh exposure can be considered with a long-term investment horizon.\n\nAn important point to note is that the outlook for gold is bullish. The precious metal has trended higher this year and trades near $2,400 an ounce. With the likelihood of rate cuts, I expect gold to trade above $2,500 an ounce in the coming months. IAMGOLD is therefore positioned to benefit from higher price realization.\n\nSpecific to the company, there are two positives to note. First, IAMGOLD has strong fundamentals and ended Q1 2024 with a liquidity buffer of $693.8 million. This allows the gold miner to aggressively invest in exploration activities.\n\nFurther, IAMGOLD has just commenced production from the C\u00f4t\u00e9 gold asset, which is among the largest gold mines in Canada. In the next few years, the C\u00f4t\u00e9 asset will support production growth coupled with revenue upside. With higher realized prices, cash flows are likely to swell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "It is becoming clear that 2024 is a very different year than the last year. Although we\u2019re still in the middle of a bull market, it is more of a broad-based rally, higher this time than it was in 2023.\n\nBack then, the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks accounted for virtually all of the market\u2019s gains. This year, although most of those companies are still performing well \u2014 and some like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continue to do very well \u2014 the seven tech giants are not having the same impact.\n\nWell, on the S&P 500 they are, because it is a market capitalization-weighted index. Six of the Magnificent Seven are worth $1 trillion or more (only laggard Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is not). That means their movements affect the index more than they do a price-weighted index like the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt is also why the S&P 500 is up 17% year-to-date and the Dow is up a measly 4%. Yet this offers investors an opportunity. It suggests undervalued Dow stocks may be more prevalent than those on the popular benchmark index.\n\nSo let\u2019s dive into the three companies below that may be some of the best undervalued Dow stocks to buy today.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is an investment bank in transition. Weighed down by acquisitions in wealth management and installment lending that it thought would diversify its operations, today the financial giant is reorganizing its efforts to concentrate on investment banking, trading, and investment management. It will continue divesting consumer-facing businesses.\n\nGoldman took big writedowns on its home improvement lender GreenSky, which it sold last October. It also scrapped its co-branded credit cards with General Motors (NYSE:GM) while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) terminated its Goldman Sachs card.\n\nThe turnaround effort is working. First-quarter profit exceeded analyst expectations as the investment banking division benefited from increases in underwriting and dealmaking. Last year was a mixed one for mergers and acquisitions. While dealmaking hit a decade low, some of the biggest acquisitions ever took place, including Exxon Mobil\u2019s (NYSE:XOM) purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources. Goldman Sachs was the lead advisor on the $60 billion transaction.\n\nThe investment banker\u2019s stock is up 50% over the past year and Wall Street expects earnings to grow 22% annually for the next five years. Trading at just a fraction to those projected growth rates, Goldman Sachs stock is one of the leading undervalued Dow stocks to buy today.\n\nStory continues\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nIndustrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM) has destroyed value for investors for years. Over the past decade, the owner of Post-It Notes and Scotch-brand tape has a total return of just 23% compared to a 190% return by the Dow.\n\nIts malaise culminated in May of this year when this former Dividend King slashed its dividend by more than half. Facing mounting lawsuits over faulty products (made by a company it acquired) and environmental pollution allegations, 3M was forced to conserve cash. But it also spun off its consumer products business Solventum (NYSE:SOLV) to return some value to shareholders and began settling the lawsuits against it.\n\nToday, 3M is a much healthier company financially and the markets approve. Shares are up 9% in 2024 which turned the conglomerate into an undervalued Dow stock worth buying. 3M goes for 12 times earnings estimates and a deeply discounted 11x free cash flow (FCF). With a lower dividend payment, 3M can now support the payout. MMM stock deserves renewed consideration by investors.\n\nDow (DOW) DOW Chemical sign outside of a corporate building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis is fun to write: chemical stock Dow (NYSE:DOW) is an undervalued Dow stock. Shares trade at 12 times earnings estimates, a fraction of sales and 14x FCF. Dow stock, though, is down 5% this year and off 2% for the last 12 months. Shares remain 27% below the all-time high they hit in 2021.\n\nThe tide is turning for the chemicals company. Demand recovered in the first quarter even though sales were down 9% year-over-year. However, they were up 1% sequentially. Chairman and CEO Jim Fitterling told investors, \u201cWe captured improving demand, maintained pricing, and benefited from lower feedstock and energy costs.\u201d As a result, volumes grew and margins expanded.\n\nBecause chemicals are a commodity and their price tends to move in tandem with Brent crude oil prices, Dow should benefit from Brent prices north of $84 a barrel. That is 5% above the price one year ago. The Energy Information Administration forecasts oil to trade around $89 a barrel in the back half of 2024. It does not expect that to change much next year as it forecasts Brent crude at $88 a barrel.\n\nThe higher prices should help Dow improve its capacity utilization. And with lower natural gas prices in the mix now and going forward, the chemicals stock should also benefit as it lowers its feedstock costs. That points to improving profitability and should have investors putting DOW stock on their buy list.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in MMM, SOLV and XOM stock.

        "title": "Tesla's US EV market share dips below 50% in Q2 as Ford, Kia, BMW see growth",
        "content": "As EV sales continue to grow in the US, albeit at a slower pace than expected, Tesla\u2019s share of the market dipped below a key level as improved competitor EV offerings hit showroom floors.\n\nCox Automotive's latest EV sales report found that Tesla\u2019s share of US EV sales fell below 50% for the first time, to 49.7%. This comes as Cox estimates overall EV sales grew to approximately 8% of the total market, up from the 7.2% seen in Q2 last year, in what it calls a \u201crecord-breaking\u201d quarter.\n\n\u201cDespite Tesla\u2019s declining sales, with its EV sales share now below 50% for the first time, the overall competitive landscape for electric vehicles is intensifying,\u201d Stephanie Valdez Streaty, industry insights director at Cox Automotive, said in the report.\n\nLooking over Cox\u2019s dataset starting in 2019, Tesla\u2019s market share hit a high of 82.5% in Q3 of 2019 and has been steadily declining ever since. The steepest drop has occurred in recent quarters, starting in Q4 2021, when Tesla\u2019s market share stood at 77.5%. It fell to 50.2% in less than two years (Q2 2023) as new brands and EVs from legacy automakers hit the market.\n\nTesla's slide in market shares coincides with a dip in Q2 deliveries. Tesla said it delivered 443,956 vehicles during the second quarter, higher than the 386,810 vehicles globally delivered in the first quarter but lower than the approximate 466,140 delivered a year ago.\n\nWith Tesla now sitting at 49.7% of the market, Cox found that Ford's Mustang Mach-E, Ford Lightning EV pickup, and E-Transit cargo vans have put it in second place with a 7.2% share. Kia, its sister brand Hyundai, and BMW rounded out the top five.\n\nDigging deeper into the fastest-growing brands in Q2, GM\u2019s Cadillac took top honors with EV sales growth of over 440%, powered by its LYRIQ midsize EV SUV. Though Cadillac\u2019s LYRIQ saw its initial rollout delayed as GM worked out kinks in its Ultium EV platform, sales momentum has been growing since the start of the year. Toyota has seen its lone EV \u2014 the bZ4X \u2014 grow sales to over 7,000 units in Q2 (from 2,000 a year ago), though reportedly with big discounts.\n\n\u201cThis increased competition is leading to continued price pressure, gradually boosting EV adoption, Cox\u2019s Valdez Streaty said. \u201cAutomakers that deliver the right product at the right price and offer an excellent consumer experience will lead the way in EV adoption.\u201d\n\nGreater affordability could be spurring sales at Ford, Kia, and Hyundai. Kia's moderately priced EV6 crossover, EV9 large SUV, and Niro subcompact are reaching larger segments of the market, along with Hyundai's similarly priced Ioniq 5 crossover and Ioniq 6 sedan.\n\nStory continues\n\nLuxury brands like BMW and Cadillac are likely excelling in the customer service arena, Valdez Streaty noted, with higher-income buyers valuing dealer experience alongside product mix in their buying decisions. BMW EVs like the BMW iX SUV, i4 coupe, and i7 luxury full-size sedan have buoyed sales.\n\nConversely, BMW rival Mercedes, which leaned heavily into luxury, high-priced EVs, has seen EV sales fall in Q2 (down 22.3%), as its offerings at lofty prices have not hit home with consumers. Mercedes has now pivoted back to gas-powered vehicles and no longer sees itself going fully electric by 2030.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

        "title": "Hyundai Is Expecting Challenges Ahead Despite Reporting Record EV Figures",
        "content": "Hyundai Is Expecting Challenges Ahead Despite Reporting Record EV Figures\n\nLast week, Hyundai Motor America, subsidiary of Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF) reported its second quarter delivery figures, showing a rise in EV sales, with\u00a0IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6 EVs setting new records in the second quarters. Its IONIQ 5 is among America\u2019s best-selling EVs. However, this week brought a cold-shower lawsuit that accuses Hyundai Motor America of artifically inflating its EV sales figures, using a false narrative to mislead\u00a0the public to believe that its EV sales are growing organically, as\u00a0\u00a0the result of desirability of its EVs and customer demand\n\nThe lawsuit for a false narrative.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in federal court in Chicago by Napleton Aurora Imports in Illinois and affiliated franchises, stating that Hyundai pressured its dealers within a system where those who agreed to play the game were rewarded, while others that refused ended up punished, such as by being forced to push unpopular vehicles.\n\nSecond Quarter And First Half Of 2024 Figures\n\nDuring the second quarter, Hyundai\u2019s figures got a boost from\u00a0\u00a0IONIQ 5, whose volume rose from first quarter\u2019s 6,819 to 7,906 in the second quarter. Together, these two make 18,728 vehicles during the first half of the year.\u00a0Hyundai reported EV sales growth of about 15% YoY, with the\u00a0IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6 EVs setting new sales records.\u00a0A total of Hyundai brand vehicle sales amounted to 214,719 vehicles, which translates to a 2.2% YoY increase, while first half total sales grew 1.2% YoY.\n\nJune had also set some records.\n\nThe IONIQ 5, Tucson HEV, Santa Fe HEV, Palisade, Elantra HEV and Elantra N had their best June. During the month,\u00a0Hyundai\u00a0 sold 4,669 EVs in the US, which translates to a YoY growth of 9%. Yet,\u00a0total June sales dropped by 2.5% YoY to 67,631 units.\n\nKia America\u2019s figures.\n\nDuring the first half of 2024, Kia reported it sold29,392 EVs, which is an impressive rise of 112% YoY and its new EV sales record with its champions EV6 and EV9. This year so far,\u00a0EV6 grew 31.3% to 10,941\u00a0sold units and the EV6 is not far behind with 9,671 units, but YoY growth is impossible to assess as it wasn\u2019t being sold last year.\n\nBut in June alone,\u00a0\u00a0Kia reported a slight overall sales drop of 6.5% YoY, second\u00a0quarter sales also decreased by 1.6% to\u00a0206,839, a\u00a0decrease\u00a0of 1.6 percent\u00a0with\u00a0first half of the year\u00a0\u00a0sales contracting by 2% YoY to 386,460 vehicles.\n\nChallenges are certainly ahead for Hyundai, one way or another.\n\nAlthough it seemed for a moment that its\u00a0three long-range, fast-charging, and affordable EVs available in the US have secured Hyundai\u2019s positioning, the automaker also noted it is expecting more challenges in the remainder of the year with rivals like General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Honda Motor (NYSE: HMC) slated to release new EVs.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Retirement Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "Investing in retirement takes some forethought and planning. Stocks need to offer both growth and protection for investors in their twilight years. Ideally, they should also pay a regular dividend that can serve as an important source of income for retired investors or be reinvested to help grow a portfolio.\n\nPutting one\u2019s nest egg into the stock of a high-flying start-up company that is unprofitable, pays no dividend and trades at a sky-high price-earnings ratio is likely not the way to go for people looking to manage a financially comfortable retirement. Generally speaking, investors will want to seek out blue-chip stocks that pay a reliable dividend and offer decent growth prospects. Here are a few stocks that fit the bill.\n\nThese are the three most undervalued retirement stocks to buy in July 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find a better stock for retirement than Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B). The holding company of famed investor Warren Buffett is incredibly diversified, stable and cash-rich. Few other stocks offer as good a combination of growth and safety as Berkshire Hathaway. The company also continues to be led by Buffett, who, at age 93, remains one of the best investors, managers and ethical leaders in Corporate America.\n\nFor this year\u2019s first quarter, Berkshire Hathaway reported that its operating profits rose 39% to a record $11.2 billion. Berkshire\u2019s cash balance swelled to $188 billion, also a record. Buffett has said that the company\u2019s cash-on-hand is likely to exceed $200 billion by the end of this year\u2019s second quarter. If there\u2019s a knock on Berkshire Hathaway, it is that the company has never paid stockholders a dividend despite the massive cash hoard. But Buffett insists the money is better spent reinvesting in Berkshire\u2019s business.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s more affordable Class B stock has risen 21% over the last 12 months, including a 15% gain this year.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a classic blue-chip stock currently trading at a very cheap multiple. The Detroit automaker\u2019s share price is changing hands at only five times future earnings estimates. That\u2019s rock bottom in the current market. The low price-earnings ratio exists despite the fact that GM stock has risen 30% so far in 2024. General Motors also pays a quarterly dividend of 12 cents a share for a yield of 1.04%.\n\nGM stock has been rising on a string of positive news. The automotive giant recently reported its best quarterly sales figures in four years, lifted by a 40% increase in sales of its electric vehicles (EVs). The company\u2019s first-quarter financial results were equally impressive. In mid-June, General Motors announced a new $6 billion stock buyback program. When one considers retirement stocks, GM ticks most boxes.\n\nStory continues\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nShares of software and snack giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) look like a steal right now. The company behind products such as Pepsi, Gatorade and Lay\u2019s potato chips has seen its stock slide 12% lower over the past year. PEP stock is currently trading 16% below its 52-week high. The stock\u2019s price-earnings ratio is a modest 24x, and it pays a quarterly dividend of $1.35 per share for a strong yield of 3.35%.\n\nThe company\u2019s most recent Q1 financial results beat Wall Street forecasts across the board as the company\u2019s international sales strengthened. However, PEP stock has taken a hit due to concerns about the impact of weight loss drugs on sales of its products and a U.S. recall of some Quaker Foods cereal and bars that lowered its sales volumes.

        "title": "The Cheapest Electric Car for 2024",
        "content": "We recently compiled a comprehensive report detailing the 15 Cheapest Electric Cars & SUVs for 2024. In this article, we\u2019ll be taking a look at the electric vehicle market and the cheapest electric car for 2024.\n\nOverview of the Electric Vehicle Market\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) market is playing a vital role in the global transition to sustainable transportation. Rising consumer interest in eco-friendly transportation options has led to a surge in demand for electric vehicles. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) EV sales have been growing rapidly, reaching nearly 14 million units in 2023, 95% of which were in China, the US, and Europe. In the US, sales of electric cars increased by over 40% in 2023 to reach a sales share of about 10% of the total vehicle market. The share of electric cars in global vehicle sales has also increased significantly, rising from around 4% in 2020 to 18% in 2023. This momentum is expected to continue through 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, more than 3 million electric cars were sold, representing an increase of about 25% compared to the same period in the previous year.\n\nCar manufacturers around the world are shifting their product focus and investment towards electric vehicles. This strategic shift is driven by the growth in EV sales. General Motors Company\u2019s (NYSE:GM) EV sales in the US surged in the second quarter of 2024, with deliveries reaching 21,930 units. This marks a 40% increase year-over-year and a 34% rise from the previous quarter. In the first half of 2024, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) delivered a record total of 38,355 electric vehicles. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) also saw impressive EV sales growth, with deliveries jumping 61% in Q2 to 23,957 units. The car manufacturer's EV sales for the first half of 2024 totaled 44,180 vehicles.\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), one of the most valuable electric car companies in the world, delivered approximately 444,000 vehicles in the second quarter of 2024, marking a 14% increase from the previous quarter. Despite being down nearly 5% from the same period in 2023, this figure exceeded most analysts' expectations.\n\nIn one of our previous articles about the largest automotive markets in the world, we discussed that China is heavily investing in EV production and Chinese manufacturers are emerging as major global players. These companies are disrupting the automotive market, both domestically and internationally, by offering affordable and technologically advanced EVs. However, on July 4, Bloomberg reported that the European Union has imposed additional tariffs of up to 37.6% on Chinese electric vehicles, on top of the existing 10% duty. This move is aimed at protecting the EU's domestic automotive industry, which the bloc claims is facing unfair competition from Chinese EVs that benefit from government subsidies. The tariffs will currently be provisional while the EU continues its investigation into China's support for its EV manufacturers. This decision is seen as a major blow to China's electric vehicle exports, as the EU is a crucial overseas market for the country's EV industry. The tariffs could lead to higher prices for EVs in the European market, potentially impacting affordability for consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn July 8, Reuters reported that China\u2019s BYD Company Limited (SHE:002594), Tesla, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) rival and the largest EV producer in the world, has agreed to build a car factory in Turkey. The company will invest about $1 billion in the factory, which will have an annual capacity of 150,000 electric and hybrid vehicles. Additionally, BYD Company Limited (SHE:002594) intends to establish a research and development center at the site focused on sustainable mobility technologies. It is important to note that Turkey is in a customs union with the European Union, which allows vehicles manufactured in Turkey to be exported to the EU without incurring tariffs.\n\nRivian: The Next Big Player in the EV Market?\n\nRivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is an American electric vehicle manufacturer and automotive technology company. The company develops and builds technologically advanced and innovative products and accessories with the goal of accelerating the global transition to zero-emission transportation. RIVN is one of the best EV stocks to buy for the long term.\n\nIn March, Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) introduced its new midsize platform, which underpins R2 and R3 product lines. The R2 is a five-seat SUV that features a distinctive Rivian design and practical features like a powered rear glass hatch and flat-folding seats for cargo and camping. The R3 is a midsize crossover that promises strong performance, off-road capability, and ample passenger and storage space. R3X is a performance variant of R3, boasting enhanced capabilities for both on-road and off-road driving. The company has focused on cost-efficient manufacturing and design to price the R2 starting at around $45,000. R3 will be priced below R2, making these new models more accessible to a wider customer base. Built on Rivian\u2019s all-new midsize platform, R2 and R3 have been engineered to provide exceptional performance, range, and cost efficiency. This platform incorporates innovative design elements that consolidate and eliminate components. The use of high-pressure die castings, a structural battery pack that also serves as the floor, and simplified closure systems are some of the key features that contribute to enhanced efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nIn its Q1 2024 earnings report, Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) reported that the company exceeded its first-quarter delivery targets and successfully completed a major plant retooling upgrade. During the first quarter, the electric vehicle manufacturer produced 13,980 vehicles and delivered 13,588 units to customers. The company also announced the transition to a new zonal network architecture, which significantly reduced the number of electronic control units in its vehicles by approximately 60%, resulting in substantial cost savings. RIVN is making steady progress and the completion of the plant retooling upgrade positions the company to enhance production efficiency and meet growing customer demand for its innovative electric vehicles.\n\nOn June 25, Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) and Volkswagen AG (ETR:VOW3) announced their intention to form a joint venture to develop advanced electrical architecture and software for their future electric vehicles. German automaker Volkswagen AG (ETR:VOW3), one of the biggest car manufacturers by revenue, will invest up to $5 billion in US electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN). The partnership aims to combine the companies' complementary strengths to accelerate software development and reduce costs. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) will contribute its expertise in zonal hardware design and integrated technology, which will serve as the foundation for the joint venture's software-defined vehicle (SDV) platform. This investment and collaboration is expected to help Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) reduce costs related to vehicle components and materials. However, both automakers aim to achieve greater cost efficiencies in their EV programs by leveraging Rivian's innovative zonal electrical architecture and software expertise to enhance the technological capabilities of future electric vehicles. Both companies plan to launch EVs benefiting from this joint venture in the coming years. RJ Scaringe, CEO of Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), told Reuters that the investment will provide Rivian with the financial resources it needs to bring its more affordable and compact R2 SUV models to market in early 2026, as well as fund the development of its upcoming R3 crossover vehicles.\n\nInvestments in EV technology and manufacturing are expected to drive significant growth in the EV market. This joint venture underscores the industry's push towards more advanced, software-centric electric vehicle architectures.\n\nNow that we have discussed what\u2019s going on in the EV market, let\u2019s take a look at the cheapest electric cars & SUVs for 2024. This is the Cheapest Electric Car for 2024\n\nA row of electric cars being charged simultaneously at a public charging station.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe compiled a list of the 15 cheapest electric cars & SUVs for 2024. To collect data for our list of the cheapest electric vehicles available, we analyzed rankings of the cheapest electric vehicles on Car and Driver, InsideEVs, U.S. News & World Report, and TrueCar Inc. (NASDAQ:TRUE). We shortlisted electric cars and SUVs that were featured in at least two of these four rankings. We then ranked the 15 cheapest electric cars & SUVs based on their Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). This methodology allowed us to objectively determine the 15 cheapest electric cars and SUVs for 2024.\n\nThe Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for each vehicle was obtained directly from the manufacturer's official website. Please note that MSRP is subject to change over time. The prices listed reflect the data available on the collection date of July 4, 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "content": "These electric vehicle (EV) stocks picks had some of the best deliveries this quarter.\n\nDue to the current economic downturn, a lot of people aren\u2019t exactly lining up to snag the latest EV model. As such, EV makers have resorted to slashing prices to deal with declining demand. That has triggered a price war while straining the profitability margins for companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the E.U. has imposed tariffs on Chinese EV exports to fend off competition from Chinese manufacturers, which the rest of the industry believes has an unfair advantage of being heavily state-subsidized.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThose are just some of the highlights of the current state of play for the EV industry.\n\nIn short, the EV market is ultra-competitive right now. Only the companies that innovate the best and sell the most will thrive. And if you\u2019re looking to bet on EV stock, those are the companies to watch.\n\nHere are the EV stocks with the best Q2 deliveries, which look pretty promising.\n\nNio (NIO) A mobile with NIO at horizontal composition.\n\nSource: Freer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese company Nio (NYSE:NIO) had one of the strongest deliveries this quarter. The Shanghai-headquartered company delivered a total of 21,209 vehicles in June. That was a record 98% surge compared to the same month in 2023. This total included 11,581 premium smart electric SUVs and 9,628 premium smart electric sedans.\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, NIO delivered 57,373 vehicles, which marked another year-on-year growth of 143.9%. It built this growth on its first quarter delivery. During the time, it marked a 134.6% increase in April compared to the year prior. Shares of the company notched around 10% in July on the news.\n\nThis strong performance illustrates Nio\u2019s aggressive inroads into both the domestic and international EV market and why it\u2019s been described as the ultimate threat to auto companies in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nShareholders are waiting to see if second-quarter results will be anything like its deliveries. In the meantime, it\u2019s clear Nio is on a winning streak.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nEV maker Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) produced 9,612 vehicles and delivered 13,790 this quarter, topping analysts\u2019 expectations. With 13,790 vehicles delivered, the company is up 9% from a year ago.\n\nAnd though production dipped from the same period last year, when the company delivered 13,992 vehicles, deliveries jumped from the previous year\u2019s 12,640 vehicles.\n\nThe California-based firm reaffirmed its annual production goal of 57,000 vehicles for the full year.\n\nStory continues\n\nRivian shares rose by 7%, closing July 2\u2019s session at $14.89 \u2014 its highest level since mid-Feb. The company\u2019s stock has received a drubbing this year amid wider industry challenges. But it\u2019s also thanks to being overshadowed by bigger industry names such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nRivian investors will get a clearer picture of the company\u2019s performance when Q2 financial results come out on August 6. Until then, this good news should keep them happy.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile other auto manufacturers companies are slowing down EV production this year due to low demand, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is staying on track with its production schedule of over 200,000 EVs this year.\n\nThis month, the company reported 21,930 deliveries of EVs in the second quarter \u2014 a 34% increase over the first quarter and a 40% from 2023. That can be attributed to the strong performance of its electric Hummer, which added a 76% increase in sales over the previous quarter. In addition, the Cadillac LYRIQ, an electric SUV, also performed well, with sales rising by 26% from the first to the second quarter.\n\nGeneral Motors also saw retail EV registrations rise 17% year-to-date \u2014 significantly outpacing the retail industry\u2019s 10% gain.\n\nTo offer consumers more choices and strengthen its inroads into the niche, the company plans to roll out 10 EV nameplates. With these developments, General Motors\u2019 stock price could shoot further. Shares are up 30% this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Hope Mutie did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the stocks mentioned in this article.

Since July 1, the company\u2019s share price has risen 27%, erasing its previous losses on the year.\n\nTrading above $250 per share, TSLA stock appears to have momentum behind it right now and could move higher in the short-term.\n\nHowever, despite the current rally, Tesla stock remains down 10% over the last 12 months and is nearly 40% below its all-time high reached in November 2021 when the pandemic rally peaked.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGiven the ongoing problems at Tesla, it is unlikely that the current rally in its shares is sustainable or likely to propel the stock to new heights.\n\nNot as Bad as Feared\n\nThe catalyst for the current run higher in Tesla stock has been the company\u2019s second quarter delivery numbers, which serve as an approximation for sales.\n\nInvestors are bidding up Tesla stock because the Q2 delivery numbers beat Wall Street forecasts. However, analysts had set a very low bar for Tesla given its recent poor financial results.\n\nMake no mistake, the latest delivery numbers from the automaker were still bad. They just weren\u2019t as bad as feared.\n\nTesla\u2019s latest deliveries totaled 443,956 vehicles in the second quarter, with total production of 410,831 vehicles. Analysts on Wall Street had expected deliveries of 439,000, according to data from FactSet.\n\nDespite beating analyst forecasts, Tesla\u2019s Q2 deliveries were down 4.8% from 466,140 vehicles a year earlier and demonstrated a continued sales decline at the company.\n\nIn comparison, rival automaker General Motors (NYSE:GM) reported its best quarterly sales in nearly four years for the second quarter, boosted by a 40% increase in sales of its electric vehicles.\n\nMake-or-Break Quarter\n\nTesla is scheduled to announce its second-quarter financial results on July 23. The print is shaping up to be a make-or-break moment for the company and its stock.\n\nThe previous quarterly results from the company were a complete train wreck and the main reason that Tesla had, until now, been among the worst performing stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 index this year.\n\nFor the first quarter, Tesla reported its biggest revenue decline since 2012 and management warned that its \u201cvolume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023.\u201d\n\nWhile the company has announced a host of new initiatives in recent months, ranging from robots to supercomputers, none of the plans seem to have firm timelines or are guaranteed to help the company\u2019s top and bottom lines. They also distract Tesla from its core business of making electric vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nSell Tesla Stock\n\nAdd in the recent drama surrounding Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s exorbitant and unjustified $56 billion pay package and there\u2019s no good reason to take a position in TSLA stock.\n\nThe company\u2019s electric vehicle sales continue to decline while competitors such as General Motors surpass them. The upcoming quarter could be an ugly one that ends the recent rally in the company\u2019s shares.\n\nPlans to shift into new ventures look like moon shots at best. For all of these reasons, Tesla stock is not a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Tesla Stock\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Comeback: What the Latest Q2 Data Means for Investors",
        "content": "Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) journey in 2024 has been anything but smooth. We\u2019ve got factory shutdowns, shipping woes, and some serious competition nipping at Tesla\u2019s heels, especially in China. Yet, Elon Musk\u2019s unwavering commitment to expanding Tesla\u2019s EV lineup has kept the company on track. The recent release of Tesla\u2019s Q2 production and delivery report has everyone talking. While the numbers show a decline compared to last year, they still managed to beat analysts\u2019 expectations, giving the stock a much-needed boost.\n\nPersonally, I am bullish on Tesla stock. While the company faces significant challenges, its ability to beat delivery expectations in a tough environment, coupled with its strong brand and leadership in EV technology, suggests potential for continued growth.\n\nQ2 Delivery and Production Highlights\n\nTesla managed to produce around 411,000 vehicles in the second quarter, which is impressive considering the challenges the firm has faced recently. Tesla delivered more cars than it produced, with approximately 444,000 vehicles going to customers\u2019 driveways. This marks a 4.8% year-over-year decline in deliveries and a 14% drop in production compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nAs expected, the Model 3 and Model Y were the stars of the show, accounting for the lion\u2019s share of production at 386,576 units and deliveries at 422,405 units. The Model S, Model X, and the much-hyped Cybertruck made up the rest, with 24,255 units produced and 21,551 units delivered.\n\nAnalysts had expected Tesla to deliver around 439,302 vehicles, so the company\u2019s performance was a welcome surprise. This news sent Tesla\u2019s stock soaring 10% to $231.26 despite being down about 7% for the year.\n\nIn just three trading days, from July 1st to July 3rd, Tesla\u2019s stock surged by a jaw-dropping 23%. That\u2019s right, nearly a quarter of the company\u2019s value was added in just 72 hours, and the stock has gone up a bit more in the past few days.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more impressive is that this surge has completely erased Tesla\u2019s year-to-date losses. The stock is now up 1.8% for the year, a far cry from where it was just two weeks ago.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that even with this recent dip, Tesla is still trading at a significant premium compared to other automakers. Its P/E ratio of 64.3x is miles above the likes of General Motors (NYSE:GM) (5.7x) and Ford (NYSE:F) (13.3x), indicating that a lot of growth is already baked into the stock price. The coming quarters will be crucial in determining whether Tesla can maintain this momentum and justify its lofty valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla\u2019s Challenges and Strategic Responses\n\nTesla is feeling the heat from competition, especially in China. BYD (OTC:BYDDF), their biggest rival, sold around 426,000 pure electric vehicles in Q2, which is just shy of Tesla\u2019s 443,956 deliveries\u2014a gap of only 17,956 units. And it\u2019s not just BYD; other Chinese automakers like Geely (OTC:GELYF) are also stepping up their game, with Geely\u2019s sales jumping 41% in the first half of 2024.\n\nIn response, Tesla has been aggressively cutting prices since early 2023, which has helped maintain sales volume but also squeezed profit margins. Its Automotive gross margin dropped to 18.5% in Q1 2024 from 21.1% in Q1 2023. Tesla also faced significant challenges earlier this year, including an arson attack at their German factory and shipping disruptions due to the Red Sea riot, contributing to a 14% year-over-year decline in Q2 production.\n\nDespite these hurdles, Tesla isn\u2019t just playing defense. Elon Musk has plans to accelerate the mass production of affordable EVs, potentially launching in the first half of 2025. This could be a game-changer for reaching a broader market. Additionally, Tesla\u2019s energy storage business is thriving, with Q1 revenue hitting a record $1.64 billion and energy deployments reaching 4.1 GWh.\n\nTesla is also heavily investing in AI and robotics, nearly doubling their AI training capacity. Musk is so confident in their Optimus humanoid robots that he thinks they could boost Tesla\u2019s market value to $25 trillion (its market cap is currently around $800 billion).\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Tesla and Its Investors?\n\nA few key events are coming up that could significantly impact Tesla\u2019s future. First, the Q2 earnings report on July 23rd will give us a detailed look at their financial performance. Analysts expect revenue to reach $23.83 billion. They also predict earnings per share (EPS) of $0.60, with a range of $0.41 to $0.87. This represents a significant improvement from the previous quarter\u2019s EPS of $0.45. If Tesla\u2019s revenue growth turns positive in Q3, it would mark a major recovery milestone.\n\nThen there\u2019s Robotaxi Day on August 8th, which could be a big deal for Tesla\u2019s autonomous driving ambitions. Nonetheless, analysts have mixed views on Tesla\u2019s stock. Dan Ives from Wedbush is optimistic, raising his price target to $300, believing the worst is behind Tesla and that upcoming innovations like the Robotaxi could drive growth.\n\nOn the other hand, Colin Langan from Wells Fargo is cautious, recommending selling Tesla shares due to concerns about declining delivery growth and the impact of price cuts on margins. His price target is a conservative $120. Guggenheim analysts also raised their price target to $134 but maintained a Sell rating, noting Tesla\u2019s impressive energy storage deployments as a key factor.\n\nIs Tesla Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nAccording to the latest analyst ratings, Tesla stock has a consensus Hold rating. Out of 35 analysts covering the stock, 13 rate it a Buy, 14 a Hold, and eight a Sell. The average TSLA stock price target of $184.41 implies downside potential of around 27.1% from the current price.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn conclusion, Tesla\u2019s Q2 delivery report was a mixed bag. While the company beat estimates, deliveries still dropped year-over-year. The market reacted positively, but analysts are divided on the stock\u2019s future. Some believe the worst is over for the company, while others remain cautious about the competitive pressures and potential margin squeezes.\n\nDespite these challenges, I\u2019m bullish on Tesla stock. The company\u2019s resilience, commitment to expanding its EV lineup, and exciting potential in AI and energy storage make it a compelling investment. The upcoming Q2 earnings report on July 23 and Robotaxi Day on August 8 could provide more clarity and potentially drive the stock higher. As always, do your homework and invest wisely.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Toyota Has Finally Hit The Accelerator On Its EV Journey",
        "content": "Toyota Has Finally Hit The Accelerator On Its EV Journey\n\nLast week, Toyota Motor\u00a0(NYSE: TM) revelaed its second quarter deliveries, joining Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F). In a nutshell, Toyota has something to brag about as its EV sales quadrupled in the second quarter.\n\nSecond Quarter Sales\n\nIn the U.S. Toyota sold 621,549\u00a0vehicles, which is a rise of 9.2 % YoY and it owes it to EVs. In the second quarter, Toyota sold almost 250,000 hybrid and electric models, which represents an even more impressive YoY rise of 63%, representing\u00a0almost 40% of the group's total volume.\u00a0EVs and PHEVs are undoubtedly Toyota\u2019s fastest-growing segment.\n\nToyota\u2019s current offering hybrids, plug-in hybrids and a fuel-cell electric vehicle consists of 29 electrified models, which is two more compared to the previous quarter.\n\nThe Toyota Group\u00a0group sold 24,266 plug-in electric cars, which translates to a 112% YoY increase, with these vehicles making 3.9% of the total volume, rising from last year\u2019s 2.0%. The Toyota brand enjoyed a 91% YoY boost as it reported 17,589 plug-in sales, while its hybrid star,\u00a0Lexus,\u00a0almost tripled its volume that grew 194% to 6,677.\n\nToyota definitely stepped on the accelerator pedal in the EV race.\n\nThe group's all-electric car sales increased by 301% YoY to 11,607 units.\u00a0For the first time in history, 1.9% of all Toyota Motor North America sales were all-electric, rising from last year\u2019s comparable quarter when they made 0.5%.During the first half of 2024, Toyota Group\u00a0\u00a0sold 42,098 plug-ins, which is double compared to the first half of 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, the EV king, Tesla is reflecting a softening EV demand.\n\nTesla revealed its global deliveries contracted by 4.8% in the second quarter to around 444,000 EVs. This is the second consecutive quarter that Tesla is reporting a volume drop, after reporting an 8.5% YoY decline in the first quarter. But fortunately for Tesla, the latest fall was milder than what analysts expected.\n\nLong gone are the days that Tesla the EV market almost to itself. With intensified competition from BYD Company Limited (OTC: BYDDY) and even newcomers like Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO), Tesla is forced to fight for its place under the EV sun. In addition, legacy automakers like Toyota, GM and Ford are determined to catch up. Although the Chinese brands succeeded to undercut Tesla on price in their home market, legacy automakers undoubtedly have their know-how on their side in building their competitive advantage on. By the looks of it, Toyota has finally picked up the pace, so the EV race is about to get even more interesting.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Electric Pickups And SUVs Continue To Power Up GM And Ford's EV Progress\n\nThis week, Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) revealed it had its second-best quarter despite challenges as its U.S. EV sales improved both during the quarter and in June. General Motors (NYSE: GM) also\u00a0posted its best quarterly sales figures in more than three years and it owes it to notable increases in pickup truck and EV sales.\u00a0Moreover, its second quarter EV deliveries reached a record, while its\u00a0full-size pickup truck deliveries were the highest since 2021.\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nIn the second quarter, GM\u00a0delivered 696,086 vehicles, marking a 0.6% YoY increase and highest since the fourth quarter of 2020.\u00a0GM reported record EV sales that grew 40% YoY to 21,930, boosted by a jump in deliveries of the Cadillac Lyriq. But, EVs still made only\u00a03.2% of its total second-quarter sales. GM sold about 229,000 full-size pickup trucks which is a 6% YoY increase.\u00a0For the first half of the year, GM\u2019s total sales contracted 0.4% YoY to almost 1.3 million vehicles. On a less bright note,\u00a0\u00a0the US Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0revealed this week thatGM failed to comply with the Clean Air Act and will need to\u00a0pay a penalty of $145.8 million penalty due to excess CO2 emissions\u00a0over a six-year span. GM has not addmited to commiting any wrongdoing but stated the\u00a0problem is the result of a change in testing procedures that the EPA put in place in 2016, showing its\u00a0willingness to\u00a0resolve the outstanding issues with the federal government.\n\nFord Motor\n\nDuring the second quarter, Ford reported a slight 0.8% YoY growth as it sold\u00a0536,050 vehicles.\u00a0\u00a0In June, Ford\u00a0reported it sold 166,448 vehicles\u00a0which means its sales contracted 6% YoY. But the bigger picture is that Ford\u00a0grew its all-electric car sales. During last year\u2019s comparable quarter, EVs made 3.5% of its total volume, and their share has now growth to 4.4%. In June, it sold 6,972 EVs which represents a YoY increase of 18%. Also in June, Ford F-150 Lightning sales grew as much as 79% YoY to 2,552 units.\n\nThis summer, electric pickups and SUVs are also in for a treat with the release of a solar powered tonneau cover by Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP). Worksport is scheduled to release an innovative power duo as the SOLIS tonneau cover is to be accompanied by COR, a portable battery system.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks to Sell in July Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "Tech stocks are not invincible. Despite the hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), many tech stocks are struggling and look vulnerable right now. Warning signs are flashing at many leading technology companies and can be plainly seen in quarterly financial statements, proxy votes and various sales and delivery data points.\n\nBeing aware of trouble brewing at companies is important if investors are to avoid poor-performing stocks that can drag down a portfolio and leave it deep in the red. Luckily, there is plenty of news and information available for public companies that investors can digest and use to make informed decisions about stocks.\n\nHere are three tech stocks to sell in July before they crash and burn.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors buying shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after the company reported its latest delivery figures might want to pump the breaks. While TSLA stock gained more than 15% after the company reported second-quarter electric vehicle (EV) delivery numbers, the stock is rising because the data was not as bad as feared. For Q2, Tesla deliveries totaled 443,956 vehicles.\n\nThe Q2 delivery number beat Wall Street forecasts that called for deliveries of 439,000. But despite beating analyst forecasts, Tesla\u2019s Q2 deliveries were down 4.8% from a year earlier amid a continued sales decline. At the same time, General Motors (NYSE:GM), one of Tesla\u2019s main competitors, reported that its electric vehicle sales rose 40% year-over-year in Q2 of this year.\n\nTesla is scheduled to announce its second-quarter financial results on July 23. It\u2019s looking increasingly like a make-or-break quarterly print for Tesla. If the company misses Wall Street targets, TSLA stock could tank.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) The logo for Micron Technology Inc (MU) is displayed on a large white and blue building.\n\nThe recent print from Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) was a letdown, sending the share price down more than 5%. While the data storage company posted decent results for its recently completed quarter, forward guidance in line with Wall Street expectations left investors wanting more. This was especially true after MU stock gained more than 60% year-to-date on expectations for big growth fueled by AI.\n\nMicron, which manufactures computer memory and data storage products, said it expects EPS of $1.08 on revenue of $7.6 billion for the second quarter of the calendar year. Analysts had been looking for earnings of $1.05 on revenue of $7.6 billion. Micron is benefitting from the current boom in AI as its advanced memory is used with AI microchips and processors. However, Micron\u2019s smartphone and personal computer (PC) business units are struggling with weak global demand, offsetting the AI gains.\n\nStory continues\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe latest blow to cloud computing firm Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is that its stockholders voted against the company\u2019s executive compensation plan, including for CEO Marc Benioff. The rejection comes after shareholder advisory groups raised public concerns about large equity awards granted to Salesforce executives, including Benioff. Last year, Benioff received $39.6 million in total compensation, up from $29.9 million the previous year.\n\nIn January, Salesforce\u2019s board of directors gave Benioff a stock award worth $20 million in recognition of the company\u2019s \u201c\u2026strong financial performance in the fiscal year.\u201d However, shareholders disagreed with the stock award, citing the trailing performance of CRM stock and disappointing financial results. Salesforce recently missed its quarterly revenue target for the first time since 2006. Plus, Benioff is already among the largest shareholders of Salesforce, with a stake worth over $8 billion.\n\nWhile the vote from the annual meeting is non-binding and the board of directors is not obligated to follow it, the situation shows that more cracks are forming at Salesforce. The company\u2019s stock has been flat so far in 2024, badly trailing the 23% year-to-date gain in the Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "General Motors (GM) Faces $146M Fine for Excess Emission",
        "content": "General Motors Company GM will pay nearly $146 million in penalties to the federal government due to 5.9 million of its older vehicles failing to meet emissions and fuel economy standards.\r\n\r\nPer the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), certain GM models from 2012 to 2018 did not comply with federal fuel economy requirements. This penalty follows the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) findings that the company's pickup trucks and SUVs emit more than 10% carbon dioxide on average than initially claimed by General Motors\u2019 compliance tests. The automaker will also cancel 50 million metric tons of greenhouse gas credits from the EPA and approximately 30.6 million gas mileage credits from the NHTSA.\r\n\r\nPer EPA, the vehicles will remain operational and cannot be repaired. On average, they consume at least 10% more fuel than indicated on the window stickers, but GM will not be required to update these stickers.\r\n\r\nPer the automaker, it adhered to all pollution and mileage certification regulations and does not admit to any wrongdoing or violations of the Clean Air Act. Per Bill Grotz, General Motors\u2019 spokesman, the issue arises from a change in EPA testing procedures implemented in 2016.\r\n\r\nVehicle owners are not required to take any action, as there is no defect in the vehicles. The enforcement action covers about 4.6 million full-size pickups and SUVs, and about 1.3 million midsize SUVs, including models like the Chevy Tahoe, Cadillac Escalade and Chevy Silverado, totaling around 40 variations.\r\n\r\nIn a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, GM estimated the total cost to resolve the matter would be $490 million. Since the automaker agreed to address the excess emissions, the EPA deemed a formal determination regarding the reasons for the excess pollution unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn similar cases, automakers have been fined under the Clean Air Act, with the Justice Department typically involved. In 2014, Hyundai and Kia paid a $100 million civil penalty to settle a two-year investigation into overstated gas mileage on window stickers for 1.2 million vehicles.\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nGM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the auto space are Blue Bird Corporation BLBD, Geely Automobile Holdings Limited GELYY and American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc.

        "title": "The 3 Best Autonomous Vehicle Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "Bloomberg Opinion columnist Matthew Iglesias wrote a great piece on June 30 about the far-too-cautious approach of the U.S. when it comes to robotaxis and autonomous vehicles. It got me thinking about the best autonomous vehicle stocks.\n\nThe article starts with the author talking about his first drive in a Waymo driverless car in the area around the Georgetown neighborhood in Washington, D.C. The 15-minute ride, which included the vehicle navigating fire trucks, was flawless.\n\nWhile Waymo is in a handful of U.S. cities, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) operates a much larger fleet across many more cities. Essentially, the Chinese are opting for more data quickly to make autonomous driving even safer in the years ahead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese observations by Iglesias are helpful for anyone looking to invest in the best autonomous vehicle stocks. They suggest investors ought to focus their investments on Chinese companies and other non-domestic industry participants.\n\nHere are the three best autonomous vehicle stocks to buy.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe beauty of investing in Baidu is that you get so many different revenue streams in addition to its autonomous vehicle business that you almost don\u2019t have to worry about setbacks in the technology as you would if it were an independent pure-play.\n\nBaidu Core accounts for about 70% of its revenue, with three segments: Mobile Ecosystem, AI Cloud and Intelligent Driving & Other Growth Initiatives accounting for this revenue. The third segment includes its Apollo Go autonomous ride-hailing services and Baidu Apollo\u2019s self-driving auto solutions that are in many of the major automaker\u2019s vehicles.\n\nIn 2023, the company\u2019s Apollo Go! RoboTaxis provided over three million rides to people living in more than 10 Chinese cities. Since July 2022, it has been charging customers for driverless rides.\n\nBaidu\u2019s robotaxi business is expected to break even this year and be profitable next year. It generated $1.14 billion in adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in the first quarter alone. Autonomous driving has a while to go before it\u2019s a big contributor to the company\u2019s bottom line.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to wait knowing that the company already has rock-solid financials.\n\nHonda Motor (HMC) honda logo on a sign outside a honda dealership\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn January, Honda Motor (NYSE:HMC) CEO Toshihiro Mibe told Bloomberg Television that it will actively seek collaboration with General Motors (NYSE:GM) in the years ahead to deliver EV products for its global customer base. In 2024, it\u2019s launching both the Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX in partnership with GM.\n\nStory continues\n\nHonda sees self-driving vehicles by 2030. It really depends on how soon the technology is available. Mibe did say that its EV launches in 2026 won\u2019t have autonomous driving technology.\n\nIn May, the company said it would launch self-driving taxis in Japan by 2026.\n\nIt is partnering with Kokusai Motorcars and Teito Motor Transportation, two existing taxi companies, to encourage the Japanese government to change the legislation to allow for this technology on its roads. Currently, Japan\u2019s legislation does not allow outsourcing of driving-related decisions. It plans to start the project with 500 driverless vehicles to determine if 2026 is feasible.\n\nHonda\u2019s stock is up 6% year-to-date and 24% over the past five years. Expect its collaborative process to deliver more value in the years ahead.\n\nHoneywell (HON) Quantum Computing Stocks - Honeywell (HON)\n\nHoneywell (NYSE:HON) announced in March that it would acquire Civitanavi Systems, an Italian company for 200 million euros.\n\n\u201cTogether with Civitanavi, Honeywell will be able to offer a broader set of technologies to its customers across the globe, whether they are traditional operators seeking to increase the autonomous capability of their existing fleets or are new entrants in the Advanced Air Mobility space,\u201d stated its March press release announcing the acquisition.\n\nCivitanavi, which specializes in high-performance fiber optic gyroscope technology, fills a gap in its aerospace navigation solutions portfolio. As a result, it is better positioned to grow its business in Europe.\n\nNow, I know when investors see the words \u201cautonomous vehicles,\u201d they think of cars and trucks. However, automation in the aerospace industry could be equally lucrative for the early entrants.\n\nIn Q1 2024, its Aerospace Technologies segment generated organic sales of 18%, its seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Add the fact that this segment has the highest margins of its three segments, and the Italian acquisition is another reason to be happy about Honeywell\u2019s moves in autonomous operations.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "RIVN, LCID or MULN: Which EV Stock Will Crash First?",
        "content": "The electric vehicle industry is in turmoil. On the one hand, EV sales are booming with volumes expected to rise 21% this year. Still, the rate of growth is declining. Fewer new car buyers are electing to choose EVs when purchasing a vehicle.\n\nPricing is certainly still an issue facing EV stocks but it is really a lack of trust in EVs themselves that is hurting sales. Not for safety reasons but rather it is a lack of charging infrastructure. Because battery range is still a concern, consumers are choosing the reliability and availability of gas-powered vehicles. It is why hybrid EV sales are taking off.\n\nToyota (NYSE:TM) saw massive growth in its hybrid cars; it sold some 3.4 million last year, and now other manufacturers, notably Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are hedging their all-in bets on battery electric vehicles. They are scaling back full-electric production and bringing forward more hybrid cars.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat poses a problem for a number of EV manufacturers who only came to market relatively recently and are trying to gain traction. With rising capital costs, lack of profitability and a slowing sales environment, the three EV stocks below could crash and burn very quickly. Let\u2019s see which one might run off the road first.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nEV maker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) was just thrown a lifeline. Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) is investing $2 billion into a joint venture with Rivian in the form of cash and loans. It is establishing a $1 billion equity stake in the EV maker now, and will invest an additional $2 billion into Rivian stock over the next two years.\n\nIt is a significant monetary influx at a time when Rivian is losing money on every car it sells. By some estimates, that is as much as $38,000 per vehicle. While the EV maker\u2019s sales rose to $1.2 billion in the first quarter, its losses rose as well.\n\nI wrote last month that Rivian stock was not one to short because it already had a substantial $6.8 billion cash windfall sitting in its bank account. I also said it might do better selling its software and that seems to be the case. The deal with Volkswagen is to create next generation software-defined vehicle (SDV) platforms to be used by both company\u2019s EVs. However, \u201cwhile that could produce a nice revenue stream for Rivian, it is unrelated to its primary business of making cars itself.\u201d\n\nRivian Automotive did update the market that it produced 9,612 vehicles in the quarter and delivered 13,790. The stock rose 7% on the news. However, at what price point it is moving these vehicles was left unsaid. The point remains that while the company is not going out of business, being a software company is also not what investors signed on for. RIVN is an EV stock that should still be avoided.\n\nStory continues\n\nLucid Group (LCID) A Lucid Air pre production electric car is seen at a Lucid showroom in Millbrae, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nIn an even more precarious spot is luxury EV maker Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID). It sold less than 2,000 high-end EVs in the first quarter, which was a nice bump year-over-year and sequentially. Its problem is that it still has a huge backlog of unsold inventory it needs to move before it can put more cars on dealer lots.\n\nWith its EVs starting just under $70,000, Lucid has an added problem that EV buyers want cheaper cars. Yes, it is a luxury vehicle but even Mercedes-Benz (OTCMKTS:MBGYY) couldn\u2019t move many and it has put its EV efforts on the back burner. With the resale value of used EVs plummeting 47%, buyers are going to be even more reticent of shelling out big bucks for one.\n\nLucid had to resort to steep price cuts to move the few vehicles it did sell and that is only going to exacerbate its attempt to achieve profitability.\n\nLike Rivian, Lucid stock has been propped up by cash infusions. The Saudi Arabian government continues to inject billions into the EV maker as it attempts to build an auto industry from the ground up. Using Lucid as a proxy, it is vested in keeping the luxury EV maker going. It\u2019s another EV stock you shouldn\u2019t short even as you should avoid buying its shares.\n\nMullen Automotive (MULN) The Mullen (MULN) Five vehicle is displayed at the 2021 LA Auto Show media day in Los Angeles, November, 18, 2021.\n\nSource: Ringo Chiu / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs sorry as Rivian and Lucid are as investments, Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ:MULN) is worse. It is likely to be the first of the three EV stocks to crash and burn. It made all of $366,000 in sales last year. Yes, that\u2019s right, sales in the thousands not millions.\n\nBut unlike its peers who build EVs for the consumer market, Mullen is building commercial vehicles, primarily Class 1 EV vans and Class 3 EV trucks. And to be fair, Mullen only started production last August, so there were only a few months of sales to record, but it hasn\u2019t improved. Year-to-date Mullen only sold $33,000 worth of vehicles, all of them in the second quarter.\n\nMullen Automotive obviously faces serious financial constraints. Last year losses widened to over $1 billion and through the first six months of fiscal 2024 has notched over $235 million in losses. To its credit, that is less than half of what it reported a year ago.\n\nBut what this indicates is that Mullen Automotive is not a growth business. Unless it starts producing serious sales soon, which seems doubtful, MULN looks like it will be the EV stock to run off the road.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "General Motors Company GM reported its best quarterly sales in the United States in more than three years, with significant increases in full-size pickup trucks and EVs.\r\n\r\nThe automaker sold 696,086 units in the second quarter, rising 0.6% year over year and the highest since the fourth quarter of 2020.\r\n\r\nEV deliveries rose 40% year over year to 21,930 units, comprising only 3.2% of total second-quarter sales. The year-over-year rise in EV sales was fueled by electric Hummer, which sold 2,929 units in the second quarter compared with 47 units in the year-ago period. LYRIQ is rapidly gaining traction in the EV market, with second-quarter sales increasing 26% compared with the first quarter.\r\n\r\nGM sold approximately 229,000 full-size pickup trucks, up 6% year over year, marking the highest quarterly sales since 2021.\r\n\r\nHowever, General Motors\u2019 total sales for the first half of the year were down 0.4% year over year, totaling around 1.3 million vehicles.\r\n\r\nGM\u2019s second-quarter sales are projected to be slightly above the overall industry. Cox Automotive and Edmunds, both auto industry forecasters, anticipate second-quarter sales industrywide, including Jul 1, 2024, to remain roughly level from a year earlier due to slowing retail demand.\r\n\r\nThe automaker is making a strong push on SUVs and plans to release eight all-new or redesigned internal combustion engine SUVs by the end of the year.\r\n\r\nA significant unknown factor in the second quarter is the impact of cyberattacks on dealer software provider CDK Global. The Jun 19, 2024, ransomware attack forced CDK, a market leader, to shut down its dealer management system, affecting nearly half of all dealerships in North America.\r\n\r\nPer GM, dealers using the CDK platform are striving to meet high customer demand despite challenging conditions. Some deliveries might be delayed until the third quarter.\r\n\r\nDealers, including the largest publicly traded ones, were compelled to delay sales or find workarounds due to the attacks.\r\n\r\nPer Automotive News, five out of the six major publicly traded franchised dealership groups use CDK as their primary dealership management system provider. Those dealership groups include Asbury Automotive Group, AutoNation Inc., Group 1 Automotive Inc., Lithia Motors Inc. and Sonic Automotive Inc.\r\n\r\nThe Hyundai brand reported sales of 214,719 vehicles in the second quarter, rising 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nKia, which releases sales figures monthly, saw a 6.5% decline in June sales.

        "title": "3 IPO Gems Flying Under the Radar (for Now)",
        "content": "Though Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) may have been the most recent big-name IPO, the initial listings market is still cooking, and undervalued IPO stocks abound. The last undervalued IPO stock I picked at the beginning of June,Nano NuclearEnergy (NASDAQ:NNE), returned over 300% since I first noticed it, further proving that undervalued IPO stocks are out there if you know where to look.\n\nIn general, the wider IPO market is improving as the year\u2019s first half saw 86 U.S.-based IPOs raise nearly $18 billion, a 12% and 67% improvement, respectively, compared to 2024\u2019s first half. That does, of course, still pale compared to 2021\u2019s shockingly high IPO rates that raised more than $450 globally, but still far better than last year as economic conditions soften. This, of course, benefits undervalued IPO stocks as many still shy away from their inherent \u201copening day\u201d risk. These undervalued IPOs often fly under the radar as investors focus primarily on tech and mega-caps \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t detract from their long-term upside.\n\nViking Holdings (VIK) MV Viking Star in North Sea Canal. Detail of funnel. VIK stock and VIK IPO\n\nSource: StudioPortoSabbia / Shutterstock.com\n\nViking Holdings (NYSE:VIK) is an undervalued IPO stock operating within a segment that\u2019s been beaten down in recent years but is due for a resurgence: luxury cruising and passenger transport. The cruise liner stock accomplishes this with a fleet of almost 100 small, high-tech ships. Viking is the largest undervalued IPO stock on our list at a $14.35 billion market cap and the company\u2019s shares jumped nearly 40% since first listing in May.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company\u2019s waterborne operations primarily focus on river boating, with 80 existing vessels and 18 more to be delivered in the next two years. But Viking is increasing its oceanic presence and will augment its existing nine seafaring ships with eight more by the end of the decade. Viking seeks to differentiate itself from most cruise liners, which emphasizes partying and ship-centric activities rather than destination arrival. A generally youth-skewing crowd says that \u201cVikings are contrarians, and hence, from the beginning, the vision has been to build a different cruise line.\u201d This led Viking to emphasize \u201cquiet, understated elegance\u201d and a destination focus that targets older demographics of 55+.\n\nViking\u2019s financials already point to a sector-wide turnaround, with revenue improving 14% year-over-year between the first quarters of 2024 and 2023. Expect these tailwinds to continue as the undervalued IPO stock sets sail.\n\nProficient Auto Logistics (PAL) A photo of a large shipping vessel at sea.\n\nSource: Daniel Wright98 / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nProficient Auto Logistics (NASDAQ:PAL) operates within a logistics and transportation segment that\u2019s nearly impossible to replace or substitute: vehicular transport, as in the type that brings cars from manufacturers to dealerships, ports and railyards. The company\u2019s IPO is unique in that it was a merger of five existing companies under a single umbrella that went public, with shares climbing about 8% since the IPO.\n\nProficient Auto\u2019s customer list is a who\u2019s who of manufacturers and includes Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) and Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN). Though some car manufacturers, like Tesla, prefer to vertically integrate their value chain as much as possible, logistics of this type tends to be a bridge too far from a pricing and resource management perspective, so Proficient Auto has plenty of business in its future.\n\nProficient saw its net deliveries slump in 2023 amid labor strikes at General Motors and Stellantis and generally reduced consumer interest in car purchases. But that downward trend is already reversing as the company\u2019s total units delivered increased by 2% in this year\u2019s first quarter report \u2014 expect that upward momentum to continue throughout the year as Proficient realizes synergies it created through combining multiple companies and generally improving its own internal processes.\n\nKindlyMD (KDLY) Nurse holding a tablet with icons representing different aspects of healthcare and healthcare data representing CANO stock. Healthcare Tech Stocks. Healthcare Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: metamorworks / Shutterstock\n\nI want to first acknowledge that, among these undervalued IPO stocks, KindlyMD (NASDAQ:KDLY) trades firmly in penny stock territory at less than $3 per share and a meager $15 million market cap. However, its small size makes KindlyMD\u2019s undervalued IPO prospects more appealing. The company operates at the forefront of two unique trends: medical cannabis, which is ready to boom, and holistic treatments that blend prescription medication, behavioral and mental therapy and alternative solutions that \u201ctreat the whole person, not just their symptoms.\u201d\n\nKindlyMD\u2019s first earnings report came shortly after its IPO, and top-line numbers were considerably low at just $829,000 in revenue. But that slim sales stat is, practically speaking, a short-term hurdle toward long-term success. Specifically, KindlyMD hit a range of benchmarks that all but assure expansion and growth in the coming years. That includes becoming Utah\u2019s first alternative medicine company to contract under the state\u2019s insurance, including Medicare/Medicaid. It contracted with mega-insurer federation Blue Cross Blue Shield and secured 16% of Utah\u2019s current total addressable medical cannabis market. Better yet, for cannabis stock enthusiasts, KindlyMD and Curaleaf (OTCMKTS:CURLF) started a collaboration to expand awareness of alternative treatment opportunities throughout Utah.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "General Motors Company (GM): The Best Consumer Cyclical Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Consumer Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) stands against the other consumer cyclical stocks.\n\nConsumer cyclical stocks are highly correlated with the economic cycle. Ideally, you'd want to buy them near the bottom of a recession when their prices are lower, anticipating a recovery and rising consumer spending. Essentially, owning consumer cyclical stocks is a bet that the economy will be growing in the near future. This is in contrast to consumer staples, or consumer defensive, stocks which allow investors to position their portfolio to hedge losses in the case of an economic downturn.\n\nSince consumer cyclical stocks are riskier than their defensive counterparts, they offer higher returns and also come with the corresponding increase in risk. Additionally, while determining the risk of consumer defensive stocks might be relatively easy and off the bat calculations can be used, conducting the same exercise for cyclical stocks is trickier. Investors determine a stock's risk by calculating its beta (\u03b2), which measures the tendency of a stock to move with the broader market. Stocks with a \u03b2 greater than one are more volatile, those with a \u03b2 less than one are less volatile, and a few (like gold mining stocks) can even have a negative \u03b2 that makes their share prices move in opposition to the market.\n\nSo why is measuring the risk of cyclical stocks tricky? Well, research shows that investors can either rely on a 'reasonable' \u03b2 estimate of 0.7 for defensive stocks or narrow them down by stock sector to define a \u03b2 that ranges between 0.6 to 0.8. On the flip side, similar shortcuts are unadvised for calculating the \u03b2 for consumer cyclical stocks. To determine the risk of these stocks, a case by case approach that takes into account the earnings volatility of a firm and the overall business model is recommended.\n\nBuilding on this, consumer cyclical stocks are dependent on the business cycle for their performance. In fact, data shows that if you're able to time the business cycle, then investing in consumer staples stocks can provide an opportunity to lead all other market sectors in terms of return. The business cycle is broadly divided into four phases, the early, mid, late, and recession phases. Each phase is marked by unique economic characteristics, and research shows that consumer cyclical stocks perform the best during the first phase. This phase marks the start of a new business cycle after the previous cycle's recession phase has ended, and its biggest traits are low interest rates and an uptick in economic activity.\n\nStory continues\n\nResearch shows that the first phase of the business cycle is the one that features the highest sector differentiated performance, with the difference between returns spreading to 25 percentage points. The stocks that lead the returns in this period are consumer cyclical stocks since lower interest rates and an uptick in economic activity allow consumers to have higher discretionary spending and enable businesses to expand operations through easy credit. The 'hit rate' (which measures the percentage of time periods in the business cycle periods in different cycles over time where the sector outperformed) of cyclical stocks during the early phase is 100%, which ties in with the performance of consumer staples in the late stage among all seven stock market sector performance across all phases of the business cycle. In terms of average returns, consumer cyclical stocks return roughly 12% as a category, implying that individual stocks will offer higher returns as the data is influenced by outliers to a large extent.\n\nSince consumer cyclical stocks are dependent on business cycles to a large extent and also rely on robust consumer spending, the next step in analyzing their performance is to see how spending varies within the cycle. Estimating what stage of the business cycle we're in is a tricky process, and analysts at the investment bank Morgan Stanley have tried to do so. Their research shows that we are currently in the downturn phase of the cycle, which precedes the early stage we've talked about above. We can also try to determine the business cycle's stage ourselves. Right now, inflation is still trending above trend in America (2.6% PCE in May vs 2% preferred), first quarter GDP growth slowed down (1.6% in Q1 from 3.4% in Q4 2023), and inventories at retailers jumped by 1% annually in February. These three metrics suggest that we might be in the late stage of the business cycle which typically precedes a recession. Consumer spending slows down in the late stages of the business cycles, the downturn and the recession, and neither cycle stage bodes well for consumer cyclical stocks. A key indicator of consumer spending is consumer confidence as it indicates future economic perceptions. On this front, US consumer confidence in March, April, May, and June stood at 103.1, 97, 101.3, and 100.4, respectively. A lower value signals lower confidence, and a value under 80 can signal a recession.\n\nTopping our analysis, let's take a look at how consumer cyclical stocks have recently fared to check whether the conclusions we've reached above are supported by stock market performance. As a refresher, 2024 has been characterized by investors pushing forward interest rate cut expectations and seeking shelter in a few stocks characterized by their strong exposure to the artificial intelligence industry. Two of the most popular consumer staples and defensive stock indexes are those managed by the S&P. Looking at their performance over the past twelve months, these are up by 14.8% and 5.8%, respectively. This is unsurprising since the US GDP has defied expectations during this time period, as it grew by 4.9% and 3.4% in Q3 and Q4 2023 and beat analyst expectations.\n\nHowever, Q1 2024 GDP growth slowed down to 1.6%, which not only missed analyst estimates of 2.4% but also came with some rather ill-boding expectations for consumer cyclical stocks as spending growth slowed down from its 3.3% growth in the previous quarter to 2.5% in Q1. This figure also sat well below Wall Street's 3% estimate. The data was released in April, and the previous release which saw the 0.4% inflation reading for March outdo analyst estimates triggered a 6% drop in the consumer cyclical stock index over the next nine days. Since then, the index has gained 6.57%.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo select the best consumer cyclical stocks to buy, we ranked the 40 biggest consumer cyclical stocks in terms of market capitalization stocks by the number of hedge funds that had held a stake in them during Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA group of technicians in a garage, inspecting car parts and ensuring safety compliance.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 78\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is one of the largest traditional automakers in the US. This means that the firm has had to keep up with the times, since the rise of Tesla to the forefront of the industry has permanently altered its dynamics. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) can no longer rely on its sizeable market share and brand image in a world where customers make the shift to electric vehicles and assisted driving technologies remove some of the fatigue involved with daily driving. However, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is still a sizeable company and its $26.6 billion in cash means that the firm has plenty of room to pursue high growth initiatives. This was evidenced by General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)'s decision in June to pump another $850 million in its Cruise self driving business, which remains beset with crashes that have rattled industry watchers. While it is also struggling in the EV industry and now plans to produce a high end of 250,000 EVs in 2024 (down from an earlier 300,000), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)'s solid balance sheet allows it to accelerate share buybacks and keep investors happy as it finds its footing in the car industry of the modern era. Not to mention, its sizeable presence in the internal combustion car industry provides General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) with room to keep finances steady even if the EV sector is struggling.\n\nDiamond Hill Capital mentioned General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\nAutomobile manufacturer General Motors continues capitalizing on the shift to electric vehicles (EVs) while maintaining the strength of its core gas-engine truck and SUV business. Though it has experienced some setbacks \u2014 such as needing to roll back its Cruise driverless car project \u2014 we believe the company remains well- positioned relative to secular tailwinds within the automobile business.\n\nOverall GM ranks 5th on our list of the consumer cyclical stocks to buy.

        "content": "If you are looking for the most undervalued lithium stocks to buy now, you\u2019ve come to the right place. These companies represent the best deals in the market, trading at attractive valuations and having promising outlooks for the future.\n\nI chose these lithium stocks to buy due to their robust competitive advantages and wide moats in the industry. They have established themselves as low-cost producers, leveraging economies of scale and favorable mineral deposit locations. Their operational strengths allow them to extract lithium cost-efficiently, providing an edge over rivals.\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) market is experiencing significant growth. The International Energy Agency reported that approximately 18% of new car sales in 2023 were electric. In the first quarter alone, more than 2.3 million EVs were sold, a 25% increase compared to the previous year. With the demand for lithium outpacing supply and this trend expected to continue through 2030, lithium stocks present a compelling investment opportunity.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are seven lithium stocks to buy now or regret forever, offering substantial growth opportunities for your portfolio.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) reported strong financial performance for the first quarter of 2024, with net sales of $1.4 billion. This growth was primarily driven by the increased demand for lithium in energy storage and electric vehicles. Despite some challenges with weaker demand in specific sectors, the company\u2019s adjusted EBITDA remained robust.\n\nFurthermore, Albemarle introduced a project plan for its Kings Mountain Mine, which is one of the few known hard-rock lithium deposits in the U.S. This mine is expected to produce approximately 420,000 tons of lithium-bearing spodumene concentrate annually, significantly bolstering the U.S. supply chain for lithium.\n\nAlso, Albemarle completed a $2.3 billion public mandatory convertible preferred stock offering. This move aims to enhance the company\u2019s financial flexibility and support its growth investments.\n\nAll of these developments position ALB well for the future, which makes it one of the best lithium stocks for investors to consider.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) stands out in the lithium market, driven by several recent strategic developments and projects.\n\nOne of the company\u2019s most significant initiatives is advancing the Thacker Pass project in Nevada, which hosts North America\u2019s largest known measured and indicated lithium resource. The first phase of this project is targeted for production by 2027, to produce 40,000 tons per annum of battery-quality lithium carbonate.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to the Thacker Pass project, Lithium Americas reported strong financial results for the first quarter of 2024. The company highlighted substantial progress in de-risking the construction of Thacker Pass, including significant earthworks and the establishment of crucial infrastructure such as water supply systems and improved transportation routes.\n\nAlso, analysts have set various price targets, with a consensus target price of around $11.46, indicating potential upside from current trading levels. This confidence is bolstered by major investments from notable entities, such as General Motors (NYSE:GM), which recently purchased over 15 million shares of Lithium Americas.\n\nArcadium Lithium (ALTM) Graphic of Lithium scientific symbol (Li) in the shape of a big white gear with construction equipment and mountain around it. favorite Lithium stocks\n\nSource: GrAl / Shutterstock.com\n\nArcadium Lithium (NYSE:ALTM) reported solid financial performance for the first quarter of 2024, driven by strong average realized lithium hydroxide and carbonate pricing, which exceeded $20,000 per metric ton. The company achieved a net income of $15.6 million. Despite facing some challenges, the company remains on track to realize significant synergies and cost savings of $60 to $80 million in 2024\u200b.\n\nAdding to the bullish thesis for ALTM is that its revenue this year and next year is expected to swell 44% and 37%, respectively, according to analysts who cover ALTM. Very sizable EPS increases in the double digits are also predicted on the horizon.\n\nGiven these facts, I think ALTM could be a great addition to many investors\u2019 portfolios. Furthermore, ALTM has one of the lowest valuations out of all the lithium stocks on this list, with the company trading at a tiny forward price-to-sales ratio of just 1.7x.\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera\u00a0de Chile (SQM) Big waving Chilean national flag symbol on square at La Moneda Palace, urban tourist attraction in business district downtown of capital city Santiago de Chile, Chile\n\nSource: Jens_Bee / Shutterstock.com\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera\u00a0de Chile (NYSE:SQM) made several strategic moves that highlight its strong position in the lithium market.\n\nSQM entered into multiple long-term supply agreements with major companies. Notably, SQM signed a significant long-term lithium supply agreement with Hyundai Motors and Kia in June. This agreement ensures a stable supply of lithium, which is crucial for producing electric vehicles.\n\nAlso, for the first quarter of 2024, SQM reported strong financial results with continued lithium and derivative sales growth. SQM\u2019s earnings report highlighted substantial contributions from its lithium segment, which is driven by the high demand for electric vehicle batteries\u200b.\n\nSQM could be a worthy pick for U.S.-based investors. It offers international diversification in a growing segment of the economy, which may improve investors\u2019 diversification and potentially risk-adjusted returns. These factors are important for all investors, but especially those who may invest primarily or solely in the U.S.\n\nPilbara Minerals (PILBF) A photo of a kangaroo on the beach at Cape Le Grand National Park in Australia.\n\nSource: John Crux / Shutterstock.com\n\nPilbara Minerals (OTCMKTS:PILBF) is a notable player in the lithium market.\n\nDespite a challenging market, Australia-based Pilbara Minerals reported a net profit of $220 million AUD ($146.4 million) for the first half of 2024, although this represented a significant decline from the previous year due to lower lithium prices. The company remains financially resilient and continues to focus on optimizing its operations.\n\nPilbara Minerals successfully extended its supply deal with Chengxin Lithium, ensuring a steady demand for its spodumene concentrate. Additionally, the company has entered into new agreements with other major players, including LG Energy Solutions.\n\nLooking ahead, PILBF is focused on expanding its Pilgangoora Project, one of the largest hard-rock lithium-tantalum deposits in the world. This project is integral to Pilbara Minerals\u2019 growth strategy, which aims to increase production capacity to meet the rising global demand for lithium, driven by the EV market and renewable energy storage solutions\u200b.\n\nPILBF may meet one\u2019s requirements if they seek to invest in a company outside of the U.S. that\u2019s heavily involved in the materials sector but in the developed economy of Australia.\n\nE3 Lithium (EEMMF) a pile of lithium. lithium stocks\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.com\n\nE3 Lithium (OTCMKTS:EEMMF) is advancing its Clearwater Lithium Project in Alberta, which boasts a substantial resource base. The project has 16 million metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in measured and indicated resources, with an additional 0.9 million metric tons inferred.\n\nE3 Lithium is actively developing relationships with potential customers, including those in the automotive and battery manufacturing sectors. These efforts are expected to culminate in agreements securing future revenue streams. Completing the Pre-Feasibility Study has been a significant milestone, enabling the company to progress toward commercial production.\n\nBeyond the Clearwater Project, E3 Lithium is evaluating additional resources in the Exshaw and Rocky areas and in Saskatchewan. The company raised over 30 CAD million in 2023 ($21.8 million) through capital raises and grant funding, leaving it capitalized to execute its 2024 plans.\n\nThese factors position EEMMF well for the future as one of those lithium stocks to buy.\n\nSigma Lithium (SGML) The Brazilian flag with the sun in the background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSigma Lithium (NASDAQ:SGML) announced a substantial 40% increase in proven and probable reserves at its flagship Grota do Cirilo mine in Brazil, raising the total to 77 million metric tons of lithium oxide (Li2O). This expansion extends the mine\u2019s productive life to an estimated 25 years, ensuring long-term resource availability. The company plans to nearly double its production capacity to 520,000 metric tons per year by 2025, from the current 270,000 metric tons yearly\u200b.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Sigma Lithium achieved a premium price of $1,290 per metric ton for its lithium concentrate, with production costs at $397 ton, positioning it as the \u201csecond-lowest cost producer in the industry.\u201d The company generated over 52,800 metric tons of lithium concentrate in the first quarter alone.\n\nSGML is another great example of a lithium stock that\u2019s rapidly scaling its production capacity to meet the global need for EVs and batteries. I believe we\u2019ve only just started to tap into its potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "A conscious shift towards the adoption of sustainable electric vehicle technology has been a boon for the best EV charging stocks on the market.\n\nThe dawn of the electric car has revolutionized the automotive industry as we know it. Effortless acceleration coupled with savvy user-interfaces has made driving EVs an exciting endeavor. Add on the positive effects of decarbonization with fossil fuel alternatives \u2014 and the growth potential of these vehicles remains endless.\n\nWhile EVs offer several use cases and utility, one key driver of its adoption is the presence of proper infrastructure. Namely EV charging stations. These stations play a pivotal role in ensuring seamless access to power, thus supporting the growth of electric vehicles on the road.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe commitment to encouraging the use of more \u2018clean cars\u2019 has led to significant increase in the presence of EV charging stations. This has served as a major tailwind for companies responsible for the deployment of these stations.\n\nAs the adoption of electric cars continues to grow, EV charging companies are poised for outsized returns.\n\nChargePoint (CHPT) Selective focus. Detail of ChargePoint commercial EV electric vehicle charging station on uncovered parking lot. CHPT stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nCalifornia-based ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) leads the EV charging market with its vast network of stations and unique product offering. Unlike traditional power supply businesses, the company uses a subscription-based model to help businesses customize their EV charging needs.\n\nChargePoint as a Service is a cloud-based offering that offers a flexible option for EV charging. This all-in-one solution includes everything a user will need to manage a fleet of commercial or personal electric vehicles. Drivers, on the other hand, can control the charging of their vehicles from a mobile app. This high-utility offering has made ChargePoint a dominant force in the global EV market.\n\nNow on the surface, the company certainly has a good story to tell. After all, it played a key role in the early adoption of electric-vehicles. However, it\u2019s worth pointing out that ChargePoint has been affected by the cool down in EV purchases. This was evident in its recent earnings report with revenue down 18% from last year.\n\nNevertheless, as macroeconomic conditions in the market improve, CHPT is one of the best EV charging stocks for long term returns. Its fundamentals continue to remain strong and with the stock down 10.12% in June, this is a great entry point.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green color\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn a sea of EV-makers, RivianAutomotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a reigning favorite for several reasons. The company faced a rocky start, plagued by high production costs and unfavorable macroeconomic conditions. However, the carmaker successfully overcame these headwinds to emerge as a leader in the space.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs an electric pick-up manufacturer, Rivian was able to carve out a niche in a market dominated by automotive juggernauts, GM (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NASDAQ:FORD). Since then, it has seen impressive gains with strong delivery numbers and demand for its vehicles. The company recently attracted a $5 billion investment from Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) that sent its stock price soaring 50% in the after hours.\n\nNow while the company\u2019s EV numbers are impressive, its EV charging initiatives are just as noteworthy. Rivian\u2019s \u2018Adventure Network\u2019 (RAN) is a network of 424 DC chargers available across 70 locations in the U.S. While the stations are typically exclusive to Rivian\u2019s customers, the company recently announced it is now compatible with Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) network. This will enable the company to expand its EV footprint while creating a more collaborative charging ecosystem.\n\nRivian\u2019s strong market position and growing charging ecosystem makes it one of the best EV charging stocks to buy now.\n\nNio (NIO) Retail display of NIO store at night. NIO is a Chinese electric car brand\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nA third company that\u2019s making waves in the EV charging market is Nio (NYSE:NIO). Known primarily for its electric cars, Nio is actively developing its charging infrastructure with EV battery swap technology. If you are unfamiliar with the jargon, battery swap stations let cars swap out empty batteries with fully charged ones.\n\nKeeping with this commitment, the company announced a partnership with several Chinese automakers to expand its battery swap network across China. A total of 2,300 swap stations have been installed with plans to build a 1,000 more this year. The growth of its charging station network will eventually translate for a higher demand for EVs.\n\nNow coming to the stock\u2019s performance, a cooling demand for EVs has pushed shares lower in recent months. Adding fuel to the fire is geopolitical tensions with the U.S. and EU with higher tariffs on Chinese EV imports. But despite the headwinds, a recent uptick in May vehicle deliveries has re-instilled investor confidence to a degree.\n\nAnalysts also remain cautiously bullish on NIO stock giving it a price upside of $6.19. The stock is currently trading around $4.44.\n\nNio is among the best EV charging stocks to consider for its expanding charging infrastructure and EV technologies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDivya has a background in finance and accounting and has worked in FP&A roles at Fortune 500 companies.

        "title": "3 Recession-Proof Consumer Brands Crushing Earnings Estimates",
        "content": "The reduction in consumer spending and increase in prices has shaken most of the consumer brands in the U.S. These trends have left most average Americans spending more on necessities such as groceries. Most non-necessary consumer brands have been forced to bear the brunt of the slowing economy.\n\nHowever, these three recession-proof consumer brands are proving resilient in the face of the biting economy. Crushing market estimates, they strongly indicate improved earnings. Whether through strategic business decisions or favorable market conditions, these consumer brands are beating all experts\u2019 earning estimates.\n\nLet\u2019s get a glimpse of the reasons these recession-proof consumer brands are crushing earning estimates. And how do analysts expect them to perform amid a slowing economy?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFedEx Corporation (FDX) A FedEx employee loads a FedEx Express truck in Manhattan.\n\nSource: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com\n\nMemphis-based FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is a household name in the U.S. Known for its transportation and e-commerce business outfits, it was among the first delivery companies to initiate overnight delivery.\n\nFDX has performed extremely well in the recent past amid market conditions. Favorable industry trends such as an increase in the e-commerce industry and the growing consumer preference for door delivery have boosted growth and expansion.\n\nThe company\u2019s Q4 EPS HIT $5.41, crushing earning estimates of $5.34. Also, it marks a year-over-year (YOY) increase of 9.5%. While FDX\u2019S revenue of $22.109 billion fell short of earring estimates of $22.115 billion, it still represented a 0.8% increase from last year\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nAs one of the recession-proof consumer brands driving revenue growth in all its segments, analysts expect 2025 to be even better for the company. FedEx Corporation\u2019s revenue is expected to grow by a low-to-mid single-digit percentage YOY, while EPS is expected to hit a record $18.25 to 20.25.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logo\n\nSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) needs no introduction. The Detroit-based multinational automotive manufacturing company is the largest automaker in the U.S. by sales. The company is known for its four major brands of Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC and Buick.\n\nEven as the economy and consumer spending slow, GM has proven resilient. The company reports an EPS of $2.62 in the quarter ending March 2024 against an estimate of $2.08. And, it is expected to reach $9.54 by the last quarter of 2025. GM stock also recently hit a 52-week high of $49.35\n\nGM\u2019s record-breaking performance has been attributed to several strategic decisions that have so far paid off. The company announced a $6 billion stock repurchase authorization, a strategic move to efficiently deploy capital and improve shareholders\u2019 profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, the company is scaling back on its electric vehicle (EV) department, aligning its production output with the projected decrease in EV demand. The U.S. EV demand is expected to account for only 8% of the total automotive sales in the U.S. in 2024, down from the projected 10%.\n\nLikewise, GM expects to produce 250,000 EV units, down from the anticipated 300,000. Also, the company is streamlining operations in its autopilot percussion line, Cruise, which has yet to break even.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle restaurant store exterior sign and storefront. CMG stock\n\nSource: Robert V Schwemmer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is a fast food chain restaurant known for its fast casual dining establishments. With over 3,200 establishments, CMG is one of the leading players in the fast-food industry in the U.S.\n\nIn February, Chipotle Mexican Grill reported its quarterly earnings, noting an EPS of $10.63 adjusted compared to Wall Street estimates of $9.75. And, it reported a revenue of $2.52 billion against an expected $2.49 billion. Fourth-quarter net revenue hit $282.1 million, up from $223.7 million the previous year.\n\nAccording to Forbes findings, American households spend about 14% of their income on food. Further, the percentage of this amount spent on fast food has declined by 5% to 40% due to a reduction of consumer purchasing power. So, many people are opting for grocery shopping instead. So why is the company still crushing earning estimates?\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill has undertaken some major strategic investments in its product offerings by returning the popular carne asada to its menu. Additionally, it is increasing employee training and hiring within its restaurants. These moves have seen an increase in foot traffic by over 7.4% in the quarter.\n\nWith such numbers, Chipotle will not slow down any time soon. It is one of the recession-proof consumer brands that is expected to grow and expand in 2025.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "I\u2019ve got a surprising fact for you:\n\nNew technologies are often astonishingly S\u2026 L\u2026 O\u2026 W\u2026 to take off.\n\nIn 1950, there were only 25 million registered vehicles in America, or one for every six people. Though Henry Ford had introduced the Model T more than four decades earlier, many families still saw no reason to buy a car.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat\u2019s because, besides \u201cworking,\u201d cars \u2014 like all new technologies \u2014 needed three other ingredients to succeed:\n\nInfrastructure. Cars need roads, gas stations and service centers. Culture. People must want to drive. Incentives. Car-friendly regulations need to be in place.\n\nIn the automobile\u2019s case, the technology required the National Highway System expansion of 1955, suburbanization and a rise of American car culture before it could truly take off. By 1970, there were 118 million cars on the road. By 1990, almost 200 million.\n\nThe automobile also illustrates how these three ingredients develop in phases. The Official Microsoft Blog calls December 20, 1922, \u201cThe Day the Horse Lost Its Job\u201d after New York City\u2019s last horse-drawn fire wagon was replaced with a motorized engine. Streetcar usage declined soon after, when motor cars began clogging up streets. It would take several more decades for railways to eventually succumb; between 1967 and 1972, six major railroads went bankrupt after competition from trucks and other intermodal transport options ate into profits.\n\nThe same was true for the fax machine, the personal computer and \u2026 even the internet. Infrastructure, culture and incentives are built in stages. That\u2019s why Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) \u201cbeat\u201d booksellers decades ago, yet still has trouble competing against fresh grocers and big-box stores like Costco (NASDAQ:COST).\n\nToday, the same battle is taking shape with artificial intelligence.\n\nSome businesses will survive for decades against this new technology. Surgeons, structural engineers and hang-gliding instructors all work with life-or-death situations. So, while AI might enhance the jobs in the near term, it would take significant cultural and regulatory shifts to replace these positions with AI.\n\nBut other companies are already beginning to struggle. These firms are finding themselves on the wrong side of history\u2026 and are failing to mount a counteroffensive.\n\nThis week, the writers and analysts at InvestorPlace.com consider three categories of firms \u2013 and nine stocks among them \u2013 that are especially exposed to \u201closing their job\u201d in these early days of artificial intelligence\u2026\n\nLow-End Content Creation: Where AI Will Hurt the Most A photo of a person's hands on a laptop keyboard. Several notebooks are on a desk surrounding the laptop.\n\nSource: Undrey / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThe lowest-hanging fruit for an AI takeover may be generic content creation \u2013 the stock imagery, clickbait articles and other low-quality content you see online.\n\nThat\u2019s because AI already has the three ingredients to compete:\n\nInfrastructure. AI-generated content is now often indistinguishable from generic human-created stuff. Culture. Consumers are becoming more accepting of low-quality AI-generated content. Incentives. Regulations around AI-generated content is lax, so companies have an incentive to cut costs by using AI.\n\nNBC, for instance, found it wise to launch an AI version of announcer Al Michaels to read sports recaps from the Paris 2024 Olympics. Similarly, here are three companies that could soon see their content-producing \u201cjobs\u201d replaced by AI:\n\nShutterstock (NYSE:SSTK). This week at InvestorPlace.com, Thomas Niel notes that Executive Chairman Jonathan Oringer is selling millions of dollars\u2019 worth of shares into strength \u2013 a big red flag in his book. The company specializes in stock images and footage, which are at risk of being replaced by AI-generated content. IZEA Worldwide(NASDAQ:IZEA). InvestorPlace Chief Investment Analyst Luke Lango previously turned bearish on this content creation firm\u2026 in 2021. He saw how much trouble the firm\u2019s influencer-marketing-as-a-service was running into. Now, at InvestorPlace.com, we note how the firm is missing on earnings and revenues \u2013 a bearish sign of more losses to come. Fiverr International (NYSE:FVRR). In April, Ian Bezek noted that there were good reasons to be skeptical of Fiverr, an online marketplace for freelancers offering their services. He notes that AI will be able to perform many rudimentary tasks offered by Fiverr in coming years. A recent 20% price spike now gives investors an ideal window to take profits.\n\nMidtier Services: The Next to Fall A stack of open textbooks on a table in front of a chalkboard background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nProfessional services will be the next area to worry about. This segment still lacks some of the infrastructure required to turn AI into usable products. (Data collection remains a fragmented and incomplete industry, making it difficult to train specialized AI.) There\u2019s also a culture issue of relying on AI to do important (though nonessential) tasks. The IRS will probably reject \u201cAI did my taxes\u201d as a reason to waive tax penalties.\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s only a matter of time before AI grows \u201csmart\u201d enough to compete. Our analysts find two companies that are already seeing earnings drop as a result.\n\nChegg (NYSE:CHGG). Louis Navellier and his team note that Chegg is facing some critical problems due to the rise of artificial intelligence. Generative AI platforms are able to help students \u2013 and even do work for them \u2013 cutting into demand for the homework assistance and online tutoring services that Chegg provides. Earnings are expected to slide 8% this year. 2U (NASDAQ:TWOU). Muslim Farooque warned in January that online education firm 2U was struggling with mounting debt costs and continuous cash burn. Shares have fallen 82% since that article. The rise of AI is now compounding this issue, because chatbots are increasingly able to tutor and help with homework. This month, 2U announced it will do a 1-for-30 reverse stock split, which is a historic sign of more losses to come.\n\nCrowding Out: The Small Become Smaller a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFinally, the rise of AI will favor larger tech companies with access to data and enough computing power to use it. To borrow the same automobile example from earlier, it\u2019s like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) or General Motors (NYSE:GM) using its dominant positions in the 1920s and 1930s to develop more powerful and efficient engines, crowding out smaller players like Brewster, Durant Motors and hundreds of others.\n\nThat puts smaller firms at a disadvantage, as the writers at InvestorPlace.com note this month. AI is already consolidating some fragmented markets, and the trend will only continue as artificial intelligence widens this gap between the \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots.\u201d\n\nVeritone (NASDAQ:VERI). Muslim Farooque observes that this AI-powered media and advertising company is at the mercy of Amazon. Veritone relies on the tech giant for 30% of its sales, and its data intelligence offerings could be quickly eclipsed if the tech giant horizontally expands into the space. Viktor Zarev goes further and calls Veritone another generic AI service provider with no competitive moat. BigBear.ai Holdings (NYSE:BBAI). Ian Bezek writes how this AI data mining and analytics firm is losing significant contracts at a time when larger rivals are growing. \u201cStop and think about that for a minute,\u201d he notes in a recent update. \u201cIn the midst of the biggest imaginable AI boom possible, BigBear.ai\u2019s revenues plunged 22% over the past 12 months.\u201d The company competes directly against public cloud firms like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which have far greater financial resources. SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN). Tyrik Torres calls SoundHound an overhyped stock to sell before it crashes and burns. He notes that the the company\u2019s product is \u201cnot very unique\u201d from what is already on the market, which puts it in direct competition with better-funded firms like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung, which have their own top-tier vocal-recognition software. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Finally, Louis Navellier and his team observe this week that Intel continues to fall behind rivals. \u201cAI and foundry growth revival is far from a near-certainty for INTC,\u201d they say. They see shares falling into the mid-$20s by 2025. Analysts predict the firm will only grow its research and development (R&D) budget in the low single-digits through 2027, right as rivals are upping their R&D spending by 60% or more annually.\n\nThe Internet\u2026 but 10X Bigger\n\nThe AI developments I\u2019ve been describing are exactly what happened with the internet in the early 2000s. Poorly run firms without the ability to adapt were the first to get wiped out. Service providers like travel agencies were next. Finally, smaller tech players disappeared as large internet firms took over.\n\nAnd almost all new technologies follow this same arc.\n\nBut major technologies and the investing mania that follow them don\u2019t come around very often\u2026 maybe once every generation. In fact, Louis Navellier is predicting that AI will be the last major financial mania that he or anyone over the age of 50 will see in time to capitalize on it.\n\nLouis talks about all that \u2013 plus what \u201cfinancial mania\u201d could lead to the rise of a \u201cNew America\u201d that\u2019ll be almost unrecognizable to anyone from our generation \u2013 in more detail in his brand-new special event, Prediction 2024.\n\nYou can check out that free event by going here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung owned shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).

        "content": "Electric vehicles are in the news again but this time for a positive reason. In news that broke earlier in the week, German automotive giant Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) will invest up to $5 billion into Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN). The influx should help Rivian produce its modestly priced (relatively speaking) vehicles. It also opens the door for other EV stocks to buy.\n\nI\u2019m not entirely convinced that Rivian would be the best beneficiary of the Volkswagen deal. Sure, it sounds great on paper. However, the theme here is that EV manufacturers will be pivoting toward addressing the middle-income crowd. Anytime you shift focus toward different elements of the income spectrum, the move comes with pros and cons.\n\nSure, more middle-income buyers exist than high-income buyers: that\u2019s just basic economic math. At the same time, such buyers may not own their own homes and thus lack access to private charging. That means public charging will become a central \u2013 if not the central \u2013 issue.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat just might change the game for these EV stocks below.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile General Motors (NYSE:GM) has nothing to do with the Volkswagen-Rivian deal, it could actually be one of the beneficiaries. Again, the focus among EV stocks appears to have shifted from addressing well-off customers to middle-income buyers. That sounds like a viable plan on paper for Rivian. But you must consider the distinct requirements of this consumer demographic.\n\nMore than likely, middle-income buyers will use their EVs as a primary transportation vehicle, not a weekend car. You know what that means \u2013 range will be an issue. So will reliability and along with that a trusted brand. Further, consumers in this income bracket will likely seek an expansive dealership network for when stuff goes wrong.\n\nThese factors benefit GM. Let\u2019s be real \u2013 the company doesn\u2019t enjoy the greatest reputation. But compared to an upstart EV maker? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to assume that buyers will prefer a legacy automaker that\u2019s been there, done that.\n\nPlus, GM is profitable, expected to generate earnings per share of $9.71 this year. It may also see a modest bump in sales to $176.29 billion. It\u2019s the prudent play among EV stocks.\n\nEVgo (EVGO) EVgo fast charging station\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nLet\u2019s get into the real meat. If you\u2019re looking for EV stocks that will benefit from the Volkswagen-Rivian deal, consider EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO). As an infrastructure specialist, EVGO represents more of a direct play in the sector. Further, the company specializes in building fast-charging networks. Again, that should be extremely relevant for middle-income drivers looking to make the transition to electric mobility.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, I made a similar argument with embattled rival enterprise ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT). Of course, both ChargePoint and EVgo suffer from financial viability concerns. Neither enterprise is profitable. However, the paradigm may be shifting. Rivian is getting serious about addressing the modest-income crowd. Other competitors may follow suit. In my opinion, that\u2019s only going to make charging companies even more attractive.\n\nThere\u2019s a direct correlation between income and homeownership: the higher the income, the greater probability that said person owns a home. When you move lower on the income scale, you\u2019re likely to encounter consumers that may not have access to home-charging solutions.\n\nCynically, that\u2019s a huge positive for EVgo. It doesn\u2019t guarantee upside, to be clear. However, the narrative just got a heckuva lot more exciting.\n\nLucid (LCID) Lucid Air Touring sedan display at the Service Center. Lucid Motors (LCID) is a manufacturer of luxury EV Electric Vehicles.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nInterestingly, Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) \u2013 a specialist in the premium vehicle segment \u2013 represented one of the beneficiaries among EV stocks. LCID stock gained almost 3% of equity value on Thursday. This performance followed a big jump during Wednesday\u2019s session. But why? Some point to the possibility that another major backer of Lucid can give the company a similar cash influx.\n\nTo be fair, Lucid presents a very tricky argument among potential EV stocks to consider. Frankly, I hope that the company does receive an influx; I just believe that it would be better served if the firm continues targeting the wealthy. Rivian may find out soon enough that going down the income spectrum sounds good in theory. However, in practice, it may present additional problems.\n\nPeople who have been driving combustion cars all their lives aren\u2019t ready for a dramatic shift to EVs at scale. Imagine: you\u2019re used to pulling up to any gas station and filling up in \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 five minutes or less. Now, you\u2019re looking at 20 minutes or more.\n\nNo, the inconveniences still mean that EVs are better suited for wealthy individuals. While Rivian is distracting itself with the middle-income crowd, Lucid can gain market share where it matters.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "As an investor its worth striving to ensure your overall portfolio beats the market average. But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. We regret to report that long term General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 21% in three years, versus a market return of about 18%. On the other hand, we note it's up 9.0% in about a month.\n\nSince shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for General Motors\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nAlthough the share price is down over three years, General Motors actually managed to grow EPS by 14% per year in that time. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or else the company was over-hyped in the past, and so its growth has disappointed.\n\nIt's worth taking a look at other metrics, because the EPS growth doesn't seem to match with the falling share price.\n\nThe modest 1.0% dividend yield is unlikely to be guiding the market view of the stock. We note that, in three years, revenue has actually grown at a 13% annual rate, so that doesn't seem to be a reason to sell shares. It's probably worth investigating General Motors further; while we may be missing something on this analysis, there might also be an opportunity.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nGeneral Motors is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. If you are thinking of buying or selling General Motors stock, you should check out this freereport showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nGeneral Motors' TSR for the year was broadly in line with the market average, at 22%. That gain looks pretty satisfying, and it is even better than the five-year TSR of 5% per year. It is possible that management foresight will bring growth well into the future, even if the share price slows down. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified  3 warning signs for General Motors (2 are a bit concerning)  that you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor those who like to find winning investments this freelist of undervalued companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

These companies boast strong fundamentals and excellent long-term upside potential. Moreover, they stand out for their superb bottom-lines, which have held firm despite the economic headwinds.\n\nAuto Stocks to Buy: Toyota (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nToyota (NYSE:TM) is a true paragon of Japanese engineering and one of the forerunners in the automotive niche. The firm has effectively navigated the shift to hybrids and EVs to strengthen its market positioning further. Hence, TM stock is an essential addition to your portfolio for those who view hybrids as the near-term future and EVs as tomorrow\u2019s horizon.\n\nIt has been over a year since Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda resigned, labeling himself too traditional for the EV shift. Despite this, Toyota continues to focus on hybrid models rather than fully commit to EVs. This strategic approach has proven lucrative at a time when the EV pure-plays struggle.\n\nToyota led global auto sales at 11.2 million vehicles last year, with hybrids making up a third of these sales. Moreover, in its most recent quarterly showing, it posted a whopping $71.1 billion in sales, beating estimates by $6 billion. To put things in perspective, it was the 16th consecutive quarter where the firm blew past top-line results.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car retail store with customers. Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is one of the best Chinese EV plays but has lost a ton of value, dropping over 50% year-to-date. Hence, for those looking for post-interest rate cut plays, it might be an excellent time to pounce on LI stock at current levels.\n\nWhat separates Li Auto from its peers is its superior margin profile. It has been consistently profitable on a gross margin basis since 2020. Moreover, from a sizeable loss of $292 million in 2022, the firm snapped back to post a net income of $1.65 billion last year. This resilience has plenty to do with its operational efficiencies and commitment to creating user value,\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Li Auto boasts a robust financial position, backed by $13.7 billion in cash reserves and an impressive vehicle margin of 19.3% in Q1. Additionally, it\u2019s gearing up to deliver level 3 autonomous driving technology in 2025 and plans to expand into the Middle East market.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a legacy automaker that smoothly steers its business toward EV and autonomous driving technologies. This is shown by the stable growth in its top-and-bottom-line results and its attractive shareholder rewards program. Following its strong Q1 showing, it announced a new $6 billion stock repurchase plan, signaling strong confidence in its future.\n\nRevenues surged 7.6% to $43 billion YOY, with a diluted EPS of $2.62 that beat last year\u2019s figures by 18.6%. Additionally, the firm has bumped its full-year earnings outlook despite adjusting its all-electric vehicle production targets. It aims to produce 200,000 to 250,000 units this year behind the upper-end of its previous estimate of 300,000. GM aims to match volume with demand, as it gears up for profitability as soon as the fourth-quarter (Q4) of 2024.\n\nFurthermore, GM is channeling its healthy cash flows into critical growth areas, notably through a joint venture with LG Chem to build battery factories in North America. This strategic partnership is set to fortify GM\u2019s position in the EV space in securing critical components for its supply chain.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "EVs are giving new owners more headaches, and Tesla is a big reason why: J.D. Power study",
        "content": "Automotive research firm J.D. Power\u2019s highly watched initial quality study is out \u2014 and it appears EVs are giving consumers big headaches.\n\nJ.D. Power\u2019s study tracks responses from nearly 100,000 purchasers and lessees of 2024 vehicles within the first 90 days of ownership, and for the first time in the study\u2019s 38-year history, it incorporates repair visit data. Overall, internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles averaged 180 PP100 (or 180 problems per 100 vehicles), while battery electric vehicles (BEVs) averaged a whopping 266 PP100, 86 points higher than ICE vehicles.\n\nAutomakers have typically said that EVs are generally less problematic and require fewer repairs than ICE vehicles because they have a smaller number of parts and systems. However, J.D. Power's study with newly incorporated repair data shows EVs, as well as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), require more repairs than gas-powered vehicles in all repair categories.\n\n\u201cOwners of cutting edge, tech-filled BEVs and PHEVs are experiencing problems that are of a severity level high enough for them to take their new vehicle into the dealership at a rate three times higher than that of gas-powered vehicle owners,\u201d wrote Frank Hanley, senior director of auto benchmarking at J.D. Power, in the study.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising that the introduction of new technology has challenged manufacturers to maintain vehicle quality,\u201d Hanley added.\n\nJ.D. Power\u2019s study reported no notable improvements in BEV quality this year, and that has to do with the biggest name in the EV space \u2014 Tesla (TSLA).\n\nTypically the gap between Tesla\u2019s quality and that of legacy automakers\u2019 EVs has been wide, with Tesla\u2019s score better than other automakers. But that disparity has narrowed, with Tesla's score and traditional automakers' average scores for EVs standing at 266 PP100. \u201cThe removal of traditional feature controls, such as turn signals and wiper stalks, has not been well received by Tesla customers,\u201d J.D. Power said, which has led to Tesla\u2019s score worsening in the latest model year (to 266 from 253 in 2023).\n\nInitial quality issues with EVs come as demand for EVs in general in the US has slowed. Obstacles like lack of charging infrastructure, range anxiety, and elevated costs (which are coming down) have hurt EV adoption. Adding quality concerns and high repair costs to the ownership bill will not help the electrification of the nation\u2019s fleet of vehicles, which is among the top priorities for the White House. A Tesla supercharging location is seen on Kipling Street, June 3, 2024 in Houston. (AP Photo/Lekan Oyekanmi) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nA recent McKinsey consumer pulse survey also found that 46% of Americans who own EVs are considering going back to ICE vehicles, a surprising stat given the overall global percentage was 29%.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking across brands in general, J.D. Power\u2019s study said Ram, Stellantis\u2019s truck brand, topped the overall rankings list with a 149 PP100 ranking, with Chevrolet, Hyundai, Kia, and Buick also near the top. Porsche, at 172 PP100, beat out all premium brands, ahead of Lexus and Genesis.\n\nOn the flip side, Polestar, Dodge, Tesla, Rivian, and Volvo (tied with Audi) were the worst in terms of overall quality, with pure EV brands like Polestar, Rivian, and the aforementioned Tesla dragging down EV rankings.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

        "title": "CDK Global works to restore dealer software after hack, but the auto sales fallout still looms",
        "content": "The CDK Global (BBU) cyberattack outage, which crippled dealerships across North America, appears to be on a path toward resolution. But the damage has been done: Lost sales and service revenue could be substantial.\n\nOn Wednesday night, CDK Global issued a statement with the first positive news from the company since the cyberattack began on June 19.\n\n\u201cWe have successfully brought a small initial test group of dealers live on the Dealer Management System (DMS), and once validation is complete, we will begin phasing in other dealers,\u201d the company said in a statement to Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe are also actively working to bring live additional applications \u2014 including our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Service solutions \u2014 and our Customer Care channels.\u201d Sales hit? Cars sit on a dealership's lot on June 20 in Chicago. (Scott Olson/Getty Images) (Scott Olson via Getty Images)\n\nCDK tried to restore services last week but had to backtrack after suffering a second cyberattack. CDK subsequently admitted that the perpetrators were demanding a ransom to restore services; Bloomberg separately reported that the group behind the attack, BlackSuit, is based in Eastern Europe and was demanding tens of millions of dollars. Currently, it is unclear if CDK Global paid any ransom; when asked by Yahoo Finance about payment, the company declined to comment.\n\nStill, the new staged rollout of its DMS seems to be a step in the right direction. However, public auto dealership groups like AutoNation (AN), Group 1 Automotive (GPI), and Lithia Motors (LAD) warned their second quarter financial results would likely be impacted by the outage. The companies have resorted to alternative means of documenting sales and services, with some even using pen and paper to record transactions.\n\nOne service center in Illinois is suing CDK Global over lost business due to the cyberattack, and other DMS operators like Dominion have said automakers want to audit their software as well to test for cybersecurity effectiveness.\n\nWith systems impacted for over a week, automotive research firms are projecting lost sales for the month of June and second quarter.\n\n\u201cBecause of the disruption to dealer software systems, June sales will not be reflective of actual consumer demand for new vehicles. Instead, a significant number of sales that would have occurred in June are now likely to occur in July,\u201d said Thomas King, JD Power\u2019s president of data and analytics, in a statement.\n\nKing and JD Power project overall June sales will dip from an initial 1.41 million unit projection to between 1.27 to 1.33 million unit sales for the month, or a 2.6% to 7.2% decrease in sales compared to a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nA positive: Those lost sales could reappear in July. But even a lost week, or slow week of sales, in June could affect overall second quarter sales for the dealer groups and automakers too, due to the historically strong end-of-June period.\n\n\u201cThe CDK cyberattacks have thrown a monkey wrench into sales during the second half of June, affecting what is arguably one of the most lucrative and busiest times of the month and quarter for dealerships,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds\u2019s head of insights. \u201cAlthough the impact of these attacks will be different from dealer to dealer, this event is another speed bump on the automotive industry\u2019s long road to recovery.\u201d\n\nCaldwell noted that despite high interest rates and other headwinds, new vehicle sales were poised to be strong in Q2 due to healthier inventory levels and return of summertime incentives. However, like JD Power, Edmunds now expects sales to be pushed to Q3, meaning sales losses could be recovered.\n\nWith Q2 earnings season coming up next month, investors will get a clearer picture of the cyberattack\u2019s impact on dealership group-level sales and overall quarterly deliveries for volume automakers like Ford, GM, and Toyota.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. no longer stands above other electric vehicles in quality because head-scratching design changes on its cars, such as removing turn-signal stalks, have frustrated its owners and lowered its score in a bellwether quality survey.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSupreme Court Poised to Allow Emergency Abortions in Idaho SpaceX Tender Offer Said to Value Company at Record $210 Billion Supreme Court Ends OxyContin Settlement, Cracking Sackler Shield China\u2019s Finance Elite Face $400,000 Pay Cap, Bonus Clawbacks Bolivia\u2019s President Arce Swears in New Army Chief After Coup Bid\n\nLong the EV quality leader, Tesla now is on par with rivals such as Rivian Automotive Inc. and the battery-powered models of legacy automakers like General Motors Co., according to J.D. Power\u2019s Initial Quality Study for the 2024 model year that was released Thursday.\n\nTesla owners complained about changes made to basic functions, like window controls and the horn, which Tesla moved from the center of the steering wheel to a button on the spoke of the wheel in some models. The EV maker also removed turn-signal stalks on some models and put directional arrow buttons on a spoke of the steering wheel instead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not being well received,\u201d Frank Hanley, J.D Power\u2019s senior director of auto benchmarking and author of the study, said in an interview. \u201cIn an emergency situation when you have to hit the horn, you don\u2019t necessarily want to have to think about it. We see customers commenting that eyes-off-the-road time is increasing because they have to hunt around.\u201d\n\nCar buyers and automakers closely watch J.D. Power\u2019s quality study, a long-time measure of the reliability of cars in the first three-months of ownership. This year, J.D. Power added data on how often owners visit car dealers for repairs and information on features like rear emergency braking and back seat reminders, Hanley said. That makes it impossible to directly compare last year\u2019s scores with this year, he said.\n\nRam, Stellantis NV\u2019s truck and van division, topped the rankings, with 149 problems per 100 vehicles, followed by GM\u2019s Chevrolet model line and Hyundai Motor Co.\u2019s namesake brand. Porsche was the top luxury maker with 172 problems per 100 vehicles, followed by Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s Lexus line and Hyundai\u2019s Genesis premium brand.\n\nThe industry average this year was 195 problems per 100 vehicles. Stellantis\u2019 Dodge model line, with 301 problems, was at the bottom of the list of manufacturers that didn\u2019t only make EVs.\n\nBut the pure EV makers scored low on the quality rankings. Tesla and Rivian both had 266 problems per 100 vehicles, while Polestar had the most of any of the brands, at 316 problems per 100 vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nEVs in general have lower quality than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. While EVs have fewer parts to break down, they also tend to be loaded with new technology that can go wrong, Hanley said.\n\nIn fact, he said, EV owners \u201care experiencing problems that are of a severity level high enough for them to take their new vehicle into the dealership at a rate three times higher than that of gas-powered vehicle owners.\u201d\n\nAs a company, GM performed the best, receiving six awards for having models score at the top of their segment, including the Chevy Equinox ranking as the most problem-free compact sport-utility vehicle and the Chevy Silverado as the top heavy duty pickup truck.\n\nFord Motor Co., which is on a push to improve quality and reduce warranty repair costs that hit $4.8 billion last year, saw improvement in its namesake brand, which ranked ninth overall and was above the industry average. However, its Lincoln luxury line was below average, pulled down by quality problems with the Nautilus SUV Ford is now making in China and shipping to the US, Hanley said.\n\nFord\u2019s redesigned F-150 pickup truck, its top seller, was not included in this year\u2019s J.D. Power study, Hanley said, because the automaker held 60,000 of them for extra quality checks in the first quarter. That omission cut both ways for Ford because the gas-fueled F-150 typically has good quality, while the electric F-150 Lightning has been sub-par, Hanley said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found Surging Returns Lure Private Equity Giants to India How Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for \u2018You\u2019 Perfume Into a Lasting Business Musk\u2019s Population Obsession Comes With a Dark History\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 3 Smartest EV Stocks to Buy With $500 Right Now",
        "content": "The EV market has seen rapid growth over the past few years. Companies like Tesla went from obscure, relatively irrelevant companies, to, suddenly, one of the most important companies out there. The issue of global warming only exacerbates the need for green vehicles, making the companies covered today uber-important. While it is true that at the moment, EVs are facing a bit of a struggle; whether it be online, where car enthusiasts have developed a predominantly negative stereotype around these vehicles, or in real life, where issues with power grids are significantly slowing down the development of commercial chargers.\n\nHowever, the automobile industry stands united, with multiple companies coming together to make technology that helps alleviate these issues. This leads me to believe that there will be significant growth in EV adoption over the upcoming years. Here are three EV stocks to buy that will benefit the most from this.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN)\n\nRivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is primarily responsible for developing, making, and selling Electronic Vehicles (EVs). They have a wide array of vehicles available to consumers, including pickup trucks. RIVN also provides vehicular-adjacent services to consumers. It is trading at $11.96 as of market close on June 26th and is up 14.78% over the last month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company\u2019s financials appear to be great. While management does need to work on improving the profit and operating margins, which are currently sitting at -111.09% and -123.26% respectively, the company is growing at a rapid pace. It recently saw year-over-year quarterly earnings growth of 82.10%. Analysts have set a price target of $15.92, representing a growth potential of a staggering 33.11%.\n\nThe stock rapidly gained value today, after Volkswagen Group announced that they would invest up to $5 billion into RIVN. This comes at a very good time for RIVN, as it allows them to invest in more research and development while showing investors potential. For their investment, VW was granted access to shared EV infrastructure and software, making this a win-win. It also heavily contributes to RIVN becoming a buy stock.\n\nON Semiconductor (ON)\n\nON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is a leading supplier of semiconductor-based solutions, including intelligent power and sensing technologies. The company\u2019s products are used in various applications, such as automotive, industrial, cloud computing, and consumer electronics.\n\nON stock is currently trading at $67.84 with a market cap of nearly $29.19 billion. The stock has gone down 23.45% in the last year, a trend which I can see reversing. It has reliable profit and operating margins, of 26.67% and 28.27% respectively. Analysts have set a one-year average price target of $83.66 for the stock, indicating a potential profit of 23.3% \u2013 suggesting the stock is underpriced. Additionally, the company\u2019s free cash flow of $2.07 billion is another positive indicator\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock has consistently beaten EPS predictions over the past year, with an average surprise of 5.1%. ON has a diverse customer base due to the number of products offered by the company, which means it does not have to be reliant on one industry. This makes the company resilient to industry slumps. Even though growth is stagnant right now, it\u2019s poised to grow in the long run, making it a definite EV stock to buy.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) designs, builds and sells trucks, crossovers, cars, and parts globally under brands like Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC. It operates through segments including GM North America, GM International, Cruise, and GM Financial, offering vehicles and after-sale services to retail dealers, fleet customers, and governments.\n\nGM stock has seen pretty good financials. A positive profit and operating margin of 6.13% and 8.88% respectively, along with a year-on-year (YOY) quarterly earnings growth of 24.40% is certainly promising. The stock has also consistently beaten EPS predictions over the past year and shows certain growth prospects. Although the heavy debt load of $124.6 billion does raise some red flags, the company has been profitable for the past four years.\n\nGM released their first EV in 1996, 28 years from now. Like ON Semiconductors, General Motors also has a diverse product lineup, although mainly dealing in the automobile industry. The company has also upped its production of battery modules by 300%, as evident by its Q1 2024 reports. All this makes GM a safe bet and a promising EV stock to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 EV Stocks to Buy on the Dip: June 2024",
        "content": "With EV sales regaining momentum, look at the top EV stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nRemember, as I said yesterday, \u201cFord Motor (NYSE:F) said its\u00a0electric vehicle sales were up 64.7% in May. It also said its EV sales were up nearly 88% higher than year-ago numbers for the first five months of the year. Even General Motors (NYSE:GM) said May was its best month for EV sales ever. Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMTF) said its U.S. EV sales were up 42% in May year over year.\u201d\n\nShould EV sales continue to improve, RMI.org predicts that by 2030, about a third of all cars sold globally will be electric. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), that number could rocket to about 50% by 2035.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAll of which makes some of the top EV stocks to buy on the dip even more attractive.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nBy now, you\u2019re well aware that lithium is needed to make an electric vehicle. You also know that lithium prices have fallen significantly due to supply-demand issues, which have destroyed related stocks like Albemarle (NYSE:ALB).\n\nHowever, it\u2019s safe to say the lithium pullback has become overkill. Not only are lithium prices starting to bottom out, but lithium is likely to see further heavy demand, combined with growing demand for electric vehicles \u2014 all of which is bullish for ALB.\n\nBetter, ALB is ridiculously oversold at $92.77. It\u2019s over-extended on RSI, MACD and Williams\u2019 %R, with a yield of 1.66% to boot. Its latest dividend of $0.40 is payable on July 1 to shareholders of record as of June 14. In addition, analysts currently rate ALB as a moderate buy with an average price target of $146.13.\n\nIn short, I\u2019d use ALB\u2019s excessive weakness as a buying opportunity. At just $92.77 a share, it\u2019s ridiculously cheap.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen I last mentioned Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), I said, \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0time to buy the fear. Granted, sales have slipped, but it\u2019s still dominating the market. With EV sales regaining momentum, I\u2019d like to see Tesla initially retest $205 from that last traded price.\u201d\n\nThat was on June 17, when Tesla traded at about $173. Today, it\u2019s up to $187.35 and is still a buy. From here, I\u2019d like to see it rally back to at least $205 in the near term. Helping, as I also noted, \u201cWedbush analysts\u00a0say the $56 billion Elon Musk compensation removes a $20 to $25 overhang on the TSLA stock.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Tesla has a major leg up on its competition. As noted by Business Insider, Tesla is building EVs cheaper than anyone else. Tesla\u2019s input cost per vehicle is less than $30,000 per vehicle, which is about $10,000 less than the industry average. This is also why Tesla dominates the market with high profit margins. We\u2019ll also get a good idea of recent Tesla numbers when the company posts delivery numbers around July 1.\n\nStory continues\n\nNio (NIO) A mobile with NIO at horizontal composition.\n\nSource: Freer / Shutterstock.com\n\nNio\u2019s (NYSE:NIO) weakness is also an opportunity.\n\nAfter running from about $3.61 to a high of $6, it pulled back to $4.37, again oversold. With delivery numbers improving, I\u2019d like to see it rally back to $6.\n\nGranted, recent earnings weren\u2019t so hot.\n\nRevenue fell about 7.2% year over year to $1.37 billion, missing estimates by $70 million. First quarter deliveries were 30,053, down 3.2% year over year. While vehicle margins were up 9.2% from 5.1% year over year, they were down from the 11.9% posted in the fourth quarter. Fortunately, the negativity appears to be baked into the NIO stock.\n\nHelping, JPMorgan recently upgraded the stock from underweight to neutral. The firm believes NIO benefits from its move into batteries and the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to reignite EV demand. NIO sales are also accelerating, with April deliveries up\u00a0134.6% year-over-year.\u00a0Year to date, Nio delivered 45,673 vehicles, a 21.2% jump year over year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Sentiments for lithium stocks are possible the most bearish in the last 24 months. From being a hot sector, the sentiments have changed to fear and investors are unwilling to buy quality lithium stocks even at deeply undervalued levels. However, in my view, it\u2019s time to be a contrarian and look at lithium stocks for long-term growth.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that depressed lithium prices have translated into lower investments in lithium projects. Once demand is back, this is likely to translate into a tight supply-demand scenario. Last year, analysts opined that lithium shortage can be due as early as 2025.\n\nFurther, the supply deficit is likely to widen further by the end of the decade. If this scenario holds true, lithium has significant upside potential in the coming years. I would therefore take a brave stance and consider exposure to quality lithium stocks with an investment horizon of five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis column discusses three lithium stocks to buy and hold for multibagger returns potential.\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) was on a high-growth trajectory before the plunge in lithium prices. With growth deceleration and scaling-back of expansion plans, ALB stock has corrected by 35% for year-to-date. The lithium stock looks undervalued and offers a dividend yield of 1.72%.\n\nThe most important point to note is that Albemarle has a strong balance sheet. As of Q1 2024, the company reported a strong liquidity buffer of $3.7 billion. Further, according to bank covenants, the net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA is at 0.9.\n\nAlbemarle has continued to focus on cost cutting and is on-track to deliver $280 million in cost benefit this year. Therefore, when Albemarle emerges from challenging times, there will be ample financial flexibility for aggressive investments.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the company continues to guide for lithium sales volume growth at a CAGR of 20% through 2027. I also believe that the markets have discounted the EBITDA compression in current prices. The downside is therefore limited and there is significant upside potential for ALB stock.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is a deeply undervalued name among lithium stocks for long-term growth. For year-to-date, LAC stock has plunged by almost 60%. Negative industry sentiments coupled with equity dilution have impacted the stock. I see current levels as a gold opportunity to accumulate with an investment horizon of five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Lithium Americas is the owner of the Thacker Pass asset in the United States. The asset has an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion. In comparison, Lithium Americas commands a market valuation of $570 million.\n\nAnother big positive for Lithium Americas is that the company has secured funding for project construction. Last year, General Motors (NYSE:GM) entered into an offtake agreement with Lithium Americas. At the same time, GM committed to invest $650 million in two tranches. Earlier this year, the company received conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy for a loan of $2.26 billion. Therefore, once industry sentiments reverse, LAC stock is likely to skyrocket from oversold levels.\n\nPiedmont Lithium (PLL) Person holding cellphone with logo of US mining company Piedmont Lithium Inc. (PLL) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nPiedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) stock has witnessed a meltdown of 83% in the last 12 months. At a current market valuation of $180 million, the company is deeply overvalued. If lithium surges higher in the next few years, investors can expect 20x to 30x returns from current levels.\n\nFor Piedmont Lithium, the biggest positive is the value of the underlying lithium assets. For now, financing the construction of these assets is a challenge and the stock is depressed. However, once lithium trends higher and Piedmont can secure financing through debt or joint ventures, PLL stock is likely to skyrocket.\n\nTo put things into perspective, Piedmont has 100% ownership in the Carolina and Tennessee assets. Both these assets have a combined after-tax net present value of $4.5 billion. I must add that these assets are likely to deliver an annual steady-state EBITDA of $834 million. Further, the company has 50% stake in the Ghana asset that has an after-tax NPV of $1.3 billion. Clearly, considering the asset potential, PLL stock can go ballistic.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Value Investing Is Back! 3 Stocks With Strong Fundamentals to Buy Now",
        "content": "Volatility has increased on Wall Street while tech stocks are taking a breather. As a result, many investors are eyeing value stocks to buy, which may hold considerable potential for future returns. Research indicates that value stocks often outperform both the market average and growth stocks during downturns, offering stability amid market volatility. Although they may not promise rapid growth as some tech stocks, value stocks typically provide consistent returns over time.\n\nFurthermore, Goldman Sachs suggests \u201cvalue stocks\u2019 cash flows are typically more evenly spread out, and so are less sensitive to changes in interest rates.\u201d So far this year, the Vanguard Value Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSEARCA:VTV) has returned over 8% and offers a dividend yield of close to 2.4%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index, which represents the broader market, has advanced around 14% and comes with a dividend yield of 1.3%.\n\nMany analysts highlight that the current sticky levels of inflation mean value stocks may continue to shine in the months ahead. Therefore, including both value and growth stocks in long-term portfolios may be appropriate for most retail investors. With that in mind, here are three top value stocks to watch in July 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDarling Ingredients (DAR) Darling Ingredients (DAR) logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst on today\u2019s list of value stocks to buy is Darling Ingredients (NYSE:DAR), which is part of the broader bioenergy and specialty ingredients industry. The company\u2019s operations are closely tied to the renewable diesel market, which is expected to grow substantially as governments and industries seek to reduce carbon footprints. DAR is also a global leader in converting rendered fats and recycled meat products into ingredients for food, pharmaceuticals and personal care products.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024 Darling reported revenues of $1.4 billion, down from $1.8 billion last year. Net income dropped 56%, mainly due to lower finished product pricing and decreased fat prices. Diluted EPS fell to 50 cents from $1.14 per share. Much of this decline was attributed to lower earnings from Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), its joint venture with Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO). We should note that DGD is one of the largest producers of renewable diesel globally.\n\nDespite setbacks, investors have been crediting positive steps taken by Darling Ingredients\u2019 management as well. For example, DGD should begin sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in late 2024, enhancing the company\u2019s revenue and profitability. Meanwhile, the acquisition of Miropasz added three poultry rendering plants. The company has also seen improvements in its core specialty ingredient business globally.\n\nStory continues\n\nDAR stock has dropped over 27% in 2024. Yet analysts anticipate improved earnings in 2025, driven by sustainable aviation fuel sales, rising low-carbon fuel standards credit prices and favorable biofuels tax changes. With a forward earnings multiple of 10.9 times and a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.9x, I believe DAR is attractively valued. Moreover, analysts\u2019 12-month median price forecast of $57.85 suggests a 57% upside potential.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother top pick among the best value stocks to buy is General Motors (NYSE:GM). Renowned for its iconic brands like Chevrolet and Cadillac, GM is pivoting towards electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous driving technology, particularly through its self-driving car unit, Cruise.\n\nIn its latest earnings statement, GM reported robust financial performance for the first quarter of 2024. Total revenues rose to $43 billion, up 7.6% from the first quarter of 2023. Diluted EPS of $2.62 exceeded last year\u2019s result by 18.6%. Additionally, GM raised its full-year earnings guidance and announced a new authorization to repurchase up to $6 billion of outstanding stock, creating shareholder value.\n\nMoreover, GM\u2019s robust cash flow enables substantial investments in growth initiatives, particularly in the EV sector. It formed a joint venture with LG Chem to build battery factories in North America. This strategic move secures a critical part of the EV supply chain.\n\nGM stock has gained 28% year-to-date (YTD) and offers a 1% dividend yield. Trading at 4.8 times forward earnings and 0.4 times sales, the shares are favorably priced. Analysts have set a 12-month median price target of $52 for GM stock, suggesting an upside potential of\u00a0nearly 13% from the current levels.\n\nOrganon (OGN) pharmaceutical industry. Production line machine conveyor with glass bottles ampoules at factory\n\nSource: Dmitry Kalinovsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe conclude today\u2019s discussion of value stocks to buy with the healthcare company Organon (NYSE:OGN), offering a robust product lineup and solid financials. Additionally, the attractive dividend yield makes OGN stocks appealing for income-focused portfolios.\n\nOrganon had a strong start to 2024, as evidenced by its first quarter earnings. The company\u2019s revenues soared to $1.6 billion, a 7% growth at constant currency across all three primary franchises. Adjusted EPS climbed to $1.22, marking a 13% YOY increase.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth trajectory looks particularly bright in its women\u2019s health and biosimilars divisions. Women\u2019s health features key products like Nexplanon/Implanon NXT and is enjoying continued, steady expansion. This segment is a core focus for Organon, addressing critical needs in contraception, fertility and other gynecological conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, the niosimilars arm, with offerings such as Brenzys and Renflexis, saw a remarkable 46% growth in the first quarter of 2024. Biosimilars offer cost-effective alternatives to expensive biologics. In addition, their adoption is on the rise due to increasing regulatory approvals and physician acceptance. The global biosimilars market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 17% from 2023 to 2028. In other words, this segment presents a lucrative avenue for Organon\u2019s expansion.\n\nOGN stock has rallied 45% since January, complemented by a substantial 5.4% dividend yield. Currently, shares trade at an enticing forward P/E ratio of 4.8x and P/S valuation of 0.9x. Finally, Wall Street analysts remain bullish, with a 12-month median price target of $22.00 for OGN stock, or a 5.5% potential upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has recently faced business setbacks due to dipping demand for electric vehicles, its approach to fully self-driving cars has kept interest in its stock high. Yet, despite being the furthest ahead, Tesla isn\u2019t the only automaker focusing on the technology. Now major competitors across markets are developing their approach to becoming autonomous driving stocks, which could form a lucrative new sub-industry for investors to get in on early.\n\nFurthermore, developed nations are increasingly improving their infrastructure, making autonomous vehicles more plausible for more drivers as commutes get longer. However, investors should remember that not all technological trends in the auto industry are in demand.\n\nIn fact, despite the current media excitement around autonomous vehicles, regulations and human nature may make it so that the technology never catches on. Bearing that in mind, here are three car companies that could become autonomous driving stocks if the industry takes off.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nThrough its Cadillac-branded sedans, General Motors (NYSE:GM) has shown the most promise for competing with Tesla\u2019s autonomous driving tech. The company\u2019s wide portfolio of cars has also enabled it to test various camera and autopilot technologies to determine its approach to the autonomous driving market.\n\nCurrently, General Motors\u2019 most developed self-driving technology is called Super Cruise, which is intended for long-range cruise control and exceptional comfort. The reason this technology could be more competitive than Tesla is that it\u2019s more applicable to the most common use cases when people need transport.\n\nWhile autonomous driving around the city might be nice, having a long-range cruise from point A to point B on the highway is likely more enticing to the broader population. Pair this with GM\u2019s brand identity and GM\u2019s broad market share, and it looks like one of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy.\n\nNissan (NSANY) Closeup logo nissan car with soft-focus and over light in the background\n\nSource: Memory Stockphoto / Shutterstock\n\nThough Nissan (OTCMKTS:NSANY) has struggled to capture profit growth in the last few years, the company\u2019s ProPILOT technology could be a big step in the right direction. Much like General Motors, Nissan is focusing its autonomous driving efforts on a more reasonable and generally applicable version of autonomous driving than a full Tesla autopilot.\n\nThe difference, however, is that this technology could improve Nissan\u2019s entire line of longer-range vehicles, such as SUVs and sedans, unlike Cadillac\u2019s relatively limited number of models that apply the Super Cruise technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, Nissan could potentially perform better if autonomous features continue to be more sought after in the new car market. However, investors should keep a close eye on the financial performance of Nissan before investing in its autonomous driving ventures. Once the company addresses its slimming profit margins and expenses, it could become one of the best autonomous driving stocks to invest in.\n\nToyota Motor Corporation (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to cars and speculating on new technologies, Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) tends to be one of the safest bets an investor can make. As the world\u2019s largest company by car sales, Toyota has the widest array of customers and markets to test its new Mobility Teammate Concept technologies for better integration. This makes TM a good prospect for autonomous driving stocks.\n\nThese technologies include the Chauffeur system and the Guardian system. Chauffeur technology enables a vehicle to drive on its own. while Toyota Guardian has the driver and an AI system share roles to improve driving safety. This is possible through Guardian\u2019s software, which constantly monitors the driving environment and steps in at a moment\u2019s notice to protect the vehicle and its passengers when a collision or other safety risk is imminent.\n\nMoreover, Toyota claims, \u201cThis is not done by braking alone but by using the full range of driving actions.\u201d This would put Toyota vehicle safety in a league of its own, if true.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "We recently compiled a comprehensive report detailing the 20 Largest Automotive Markets in the World. In this article, we\u2019ll be taking a look at what's going on in the global auto industry and the largest automotive market in the world.\n\nThe Global Automotive Industry: A Brief Overview\n\nProviding millions of jobs and supporting numerous sectors, the global automotive industry plays a crucial role in the global economy. According to a report by Towards Automotive, the global automotive industry was estimated to have reached a value of $4.07 trillion in 2023. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.66% from 2024 to 2032 to reach a value of $6.67 trillion by the end of the forecast period.\n\nThe global automotive industry has experienced significant shifts in recent years, driven by the rapid adoption of fuel-efficient cars and electric vehicles. China is heavily investing in electric vehicle (EV) production. From 2009 to 2023, the Chinese government has invested a total of $230.8 billion to support the growth and development of its electric vehicle industry, as revealed by an analysis published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nChinese electric vehicle manufacturers are emerging as significant global players, challenging automakers around the world. These Chinese companies are shaking up the competitive landscape, both within China and globally, by offering affordable and technologically advanced electric vehicles. On April 3, Bloomberg reported that Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing significant challenges in China, the largest EV market, due to intense competition from local rivals. The company\u2019s market share in China has shrunk from 10.5% in the first quarter of 2023 to around 6.7% in the fourth quarter, ending in December 2023. Chinese EV makers like BYD Company Limited (SHE:002594), NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO), XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV), and Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) are offering newer models with more advanced features compared to Tesla, Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) relatively unchanged Model 3 and Model Y. BYD Company Limited (SHE:002594), in particular, has a wide range of vehicles catering to different price points. At the more affordable end, it offers the Seagull hatchback, which features a 10-inch rotating touchscreen and is priced under $10,000. On the higher end, BYD Company Limited (SHE:002594) has the Yangwang U8 plug-in hybrid SUV, which boasts an impressive 1,200 horsepower, can float on water, and can perform a 360-degree \"tank turn\".\n\nStory continues\n\nThe transition to EVs may also start gaining significant momentum in the US. On June 7, The New York Times reported that the Biden administration has unveiled new fuel efficiency standards as part of its strategy to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles in the US. The Transportation Department's regulations require American automakers to improve the average fuel economy of their passenger cars to 65 miles per gallon by 2031, up from the current 48.7 miles per gallon. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also recently introduced strict new limits on tailpipe emissions, aiming to ensure that the majority of new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the US by 2032 are electric or hybrid vehicles. American automakers will be looking to increase both the number of all-electric and hybrid vehicles they sell, as well as improve the fuel efficiency of their conventional cars.\n\nA Look at General Motors Company\u2019s EV Ambitions\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is an American multinational automotive manufacturing company that ranks high among the world\u2019s biggest car manufacturers by revenue. The company is focused on advancing an all-electric future by leveraging its Ultium battery platform to power a diverse range of electric vehicles, from mass-market to high-performance models. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), its subsidiaries, and its joint venture entities market vehicles under the Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac, Baojun, and Wuling brands. GM is one of the best car stocks to buy right now.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is making significant progress in its EV business, ramping up production and improving profitability. In its Q1 2024 earnings report, the company reported that it has increased its battery module production by 300% over the past six months. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is on track to double its current EV production capacity by the end of the summer. GM's EV sales have also seen a sharp rise, with a 21% year-over-year increase in retail customer deliveries. The all-electric Cadillac LYRIQ, for instance, outsold all European luxury brand EVs in the first quarter of 2024. Since mid-March, GM has also been delivering the Chevrolet Blazer EV with updated and improved software, benefiting from the company's focus on end-to-end software improvements.\n\nLooking ahead, the Chevrolet Equinox EV is expected to arrive in showrooms in the second quarter of 2024 as the most affordable long-range EV in the US. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) also plans to introduce more affordable trim levels for the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Blazer EV, and Silverado EV in the second half of 2024, aiming to drive volume and market share growth. GM also aims to expand its Cadillac EV lineup with the OPTIQ and Escalade IQ later this year.\n\nFurthermore, in the first quarter of 2024, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and its joint ventures delivered more than 441,000 vehicles in China. This included a significant increase of 42.6% in sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), reaching a record high of more than 128,000 units. GM plans to launch a record number of NEV models in 2024 in China, leveraging a combination of global and local solutions, including new plug-in hybrid technologies, to cater to the diverse needs of consumers.

        "content": "A lot continues to happen with the automotive industry. New vehicle sales are bouncing back as inventory levels return to pre-pandemic levels. The resurgence of new vehicles is pushing prices and sales down for used vehicles. At the same time, consumers are moving away from electric vehicles in favor of cheaper gas-electric hybrid models.\n\nThe shift in consumer preferences and sales is requiring automakers to be nimble and adjust their strategies. After investing billions of dollars to transition to fully electric vehicles, automotive companies now find that they are having to aggressively pivot to sales of hybrids, as well as pickup trucks, which remain popular.\n\nThe shift comes after several difficult years for the auto industry that included not only the Covid-19 crisis but also a U.S. strike last fall by the United Auto Workers union. Despite the turmoil, automakers are adjusting and bouncing back. Here are three auto stocks to buy on the dip this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFord Motor (F) Ford logo badge on grill of car\n\nSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord Motor (NYSE:F) has bounced back nicely from last autumn\u2019s strike. The Detroit automotive giant reported a surprisingly strong profit for this year\u2019s first quarter due to robust sales of its commercial vehicles. Ford announced earnings per share of 49 cents, compared to 42 cents expected by analysts. Revenue totaled $39.89 billion versus $40.10 billion forecast on Wall Street. Despite the slight revenue miss, Ford\u2019s sales were up 3% from a year earlier.\n\nEarlier in 2024, Ford surprised investors and analysts by paying a special one-time dividend of 18 cents per share alongside the regular quarterly distribution of 15 cents a share. Ford\u2019s regular dividend currently yields just over 5%, making it a hefty payout.\n\nF stock also continues to look affordable, trading at only 12 times future earnings estimates. Ford stock is down 3% on the year and looks like a bargain at current levels.\n\nHonda Motor (HMC) honda logo on a sign outside a honda dealership\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo Japan now and automaker Honda Motor (NYSE:HMC). Not only is Honda known for making Civic sedans and Odyssey minivans, but the company also happens to be the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer of motorcycles, a title it has held since 1959. Most recently, Honda reported a 70% increase in net profit as the company\u2019s vehicle sales surged, particularly its gas-electric hybrid models.\n\nHonda\u2019s annual profit totaled $7 billion, and sales rose 21% during the fiscal year that ended March 31. The company said weak sales in China were offset by strong sales in the U.S. and Canada. Honda sold 2.8 million vehicles globally over the last year, up from 2.3 million in the previous fiscal year, with sales growing in Europe. Honda is finding success with hybrid vehicles, which are gaining popularity among consumers who are moving away from more expensive fully electric cars, trucks and SUVs.\n\nStory continues\n\nHMC stock is up only 2% this year. Its stock looks even cheaper than Ford\u2019s, trading at only 7 times future earnings forecasts. Plus, Honda pays a quarterly dividend of 44 cents, giving it a mighty yield of 5.6%.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is doing a lot to boost its share price, and it\u2019s working. So far in 2024, GM stock is up 32%, outperforming nearly all other auto stocks. GM stock has been climbing higher on strong earnings and other supportive measures, including a new $6 billion stock buyback program. The new share repurchase comes as a $10 billion stock buyback program announced last November ends on June 30.\n\nGeneral Motors raised its 2024 guidance after beating Wall Street expectations with its first-quarter earnings. GM reported Q1 EPS of $2.62 versus $2.15 that was expected among analysts. Revenue came in at $43.01 billion compared to the $41.92 billion that was estimated. Sales rose 7.6% from a year earlier. The company now expects earnings of $9 to $10 a share, up from a previous range of $8.50 to $9.50 per share.\n\nStrong North American sales, particularly of pickup trucks, have been largely responsible for GM\u2019s strong earnings and upbeat outlook.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "title": "3 EV Charging Stocks to Buy on the Dip: June 2024",
        "content": "It\u2019s time to revisit some of the top EV charging stocks to buy on the dip. All of this is happening as electric vehicle sales start to accelerate again.\n\nFord Motor (NYSE:F) just said its electric vehicle sales were up 64.7% in May. It also said its EV sales were up nearly 88% higher than year-ago numbers for the first five months of the year. Even General Motors (NYSE:GM) just said May was its best month for EV sales ever. Hyundai said its U.S. EV sales were up 42% in May year over year. Kia America sales were up 5.1% year over year, too.\n\nThose numbers may have even been higher if it wasn\u2019t for the shortage of EV charging stations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRemember, of the 500,000 EV charging stations that should have been installed, seven are up and running. If the current administration wants 50% of all vehicles to be electric by 2030, those other 499,993 charging stations need to be set up already. Until that happens, 80% of Americans say they won\u2019t buy an electric vehicle.\n\nWith the demand for charging stations clearly growing and improving EV sales, let\u2019s revisit some of the top EV charging stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nEVgo (EVGO) EVgo fast charging station\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nJust a couple of days ago, I said EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) has substantial upside potential.\n\nFor one, earnings have been solid.\u00a0Its earnings per share loss of nine cents beat by five cents. Revenue of $55.2 million, up 118.2% year-over-year, beat by $1.85 million. Plus, it expects to achieve\u00a0adjusted EBITDA breakeven results by 2025.\n\nTwo, I noted that\u00a0Chief Executive Officer Badar Khan just bought 125,000 shares at an average price of $2.05 for about $251,250. Plus, I noted that analysts at Benchmark just upgraded the stock to a buy rating, believing it could achieve positive EBITDA by 2025.\n\nWhile the stock has been stuck in a significant downtrend for the last two years, buy it, hold it, and forget about it. In a year or so, check back in on it, with hopes that the U.S. gets its act together and installs all of the much-needed EV charging stations.\n\nBeam Global (BEEM) Photo of charging port on electric vehicle (EV) plugged into and being charged. EV Charging Stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Nixx Photography\n\nOver the last few weeks, Beam Global (NASDAQ:BEEM) dropped on earnings.\n\nWhile its earnings per share loss of 21 cents beat by four cents, revenue of $14.6 million missed by $4.71 million. While not great, I\u2019d still use recent weakness as a buying opportunity. For one, while the $14.6 million in revenue missed analyst expectations, it was still up 12% year-over-year for the company.\n\nSecond, Beam Global saw a 310% increase in EV charging new orders in the first quarter. It received a $7.4 million order from the U.S. Army for 88 off-grid EV ARC systems, a $4.8 million order from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a $1.7 million order from the North Carolina Department of Adult Correction for sustainable EV charging infrastructure products and $1.2 million in orders from leading European market telecommunications provider.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, as noted by Chief Executive Officer Desmond Wheatley: \u201cOur sales pipeline is robust and we are working on the most significant opportunities in our history, particularly through Beam Europe. As we noted during the quarter, winning the UK\u2019s equivalent of our federal GSA contract was a significant milestone for Beam Europe, resulting in our first million-dollar EV ARC contract in\u00a0Europe\u00a0from the British Army.\u201d\n\nAgain, I\u2019d use weakness in BEEM as a buying opportunity.\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) a blink charging station, BLNK stock\n\nSource: David Tonelson/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe weakness of Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) is also a buying opportunity.\n\nAfter failing at about $3.60, Blink dropped to $2.60, which appears to have found strong support. From $2.60, I\u2019d like to see BLNK initially retest its prior high.\n\nHelping, the company says it\u2019s a step closer to being an EV charging solutions provider to the U.S. government. It now has an\u201cin process\u201d designation from the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program for EV charging solutions. If Blink becomes the government\u2019s official EV charging provider, other U.S. agencies can contract Blink for EV charging.\n\nEven better, Blink was also just chosen to provide EV charging and services for Grupo Fame, a BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) dealership, one of the biggest in Mexico.\n\nAgain, I\u2019d use recent weakness as a buying opportunity with Blink Charging. It\u2019s another one to just buy, hold, and forget about at the moment.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "content": "WASHINGTON, June 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0GM Defense, a subsidiary of General Motors, is providing commercial battery electric technology in support of the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) Pulsed Power and Energy Laboratory (PPEL) and Naval Surface Warfare Center Philadelphia Division (NSWCPD). The project, Evaluation of Electric Vehicle Batteries to Enable Directed Energy (EEVBEDE), is funded by the Operational Energy Innovation office of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), through its Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF). UTA PPEL will evaluate the technology to understand current capabilities of commercial automotive batteries under dynamic discharge and charge scenarios. The team's evaluation of the technology will help provide pathways and options for domestically supplied energy storage for future use in military platforms. GM Defense leverages GM\u2019s advanced battery electric technology, Ultium, for further evaluation in defense applications.\n\nGM Defense is leveraging GM's Ultium Platform propulsion architecture, for evaluation and testing. The Ultium Platform can deliver power, range and scale beyond any previous GM hybrid or extended range EV technology. Modular and scalable, the Ultium Platform can use different chemistries and cell form factors, making it adaptable to changing needs and new technology insertions as they become available. Utilizing the battery technologies of its parent company, GM Defense can help solve the DoD's energy and energy storage challenges. The work performed in this new effort will provide insights into the performance and design considerations when batteries are used in more dynamic, high-power operations than would be faced by more typical applications. OECIF support plays a key role in the development of new power and energy technologies, which provide the DoD with advanced capabilities and help prevent power and energy from being a limiting factor.\n\n\"The Department of Defense can benefit from billions of dollars in GM investments to develop and manufacture transformative battery technologies,\" says Steve duMont, president of GM Defense. \"These technologies offer significant potential to enhance operational capability, whether at the tactical edge or on installations throughout the world. GM Defense welcomes the opportunity to support this important project and to help transition our global defense and government customers.\"\n\n\"We are excited to work with GM Defense to test the Ultium Platform to determine its potential for use in future warfighting applications. PPEL has a long relationship with the DoD and the Office of Naval Research for testing the limits of batteries used in high power applications, and we are in a unique position to evaluate this technology and make recommendations for future use cases,\" said David Wetz, a professor of electrical engineering at UTA and director of the PPEL.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"As a Carnegie R-1 university,\u00a0UTA is committed to working with industry to better develop and understand the potential of new technology. This collaboration between PPEL, GM Defense and the DoD will not only improve our nation's military capabilities, but also adds to our workforce development efforts producing next generation engineers who will solve our nation's complex problems,\" said Peter Crouch, dean of UTA's College of Engineering.\n\nGM Defense previously announced its participation in the Defense Innovation Unit's Jumpstart for Advanced Battery Standardization (JABS) project. Similar to EEVBEDE, JABS is designed to evaluate and test high voltage battery systems to optimize commercial technologies. GM Defense provided a prototype of a battery system based on GM's Ultium Platform for the project. Under the same contract, GM Defense demonstrated mission power capabilities by integrating a high-voltage battery pack into a light tactical utility vehicle. Key learnings from JABS will help inform the integration requirements of future battery electric defense solutions.

        "content": "The latest trading session saw General Motors (GM) ending at $48.11, denoting a +0.82% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.31%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.67%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 1.09%.\n\nShares of the an automotive manufacturer have appreciated by 8.18% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's loss of 4.91% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.73%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of General Motors will be of great interest to investors. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $2.67, indicating a 39.79% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $44.94 billion, up 0.43% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $9.44 per share and a revenue of $174.72 billion, representing changes of +22.92% and +1.68%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for General Motors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

        "title": "Considering Buying Tesla Stock? This May Be A Better Alternative",
        "content": "Considering Buying Tesla Stock? This May Be A Better Alternative\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is on investors\u2019 radar after the company's shareholders approved CEO Elon Musk\u2019s $56 billion compensation package, a move analysts believe could spark the beginning of a possible rebound in the stock, which is down 25% so far this year amid growth concerns and falling demand for electric vehicles. After the shareholder approval, Musk wrote on Twitter that Tesla's \"Master Plan 4\u201d would be \"epic.\" Master plans have played a key role in the company\u2019s product and business strategy in the past. Tesla Master Plan 3 was revealed back in 2023 and touted a focus on AI capabilities to develop fully self-driving cars, a transition away from fossil fuels, and scaling the company business to \"extreme size.\"\n\nTesla bulls are also back in the limelight. Cathie Wood, who owns a $910.32 million stake in the EV maker through her ARK Investment Management, recently said the stock will hit $2,600 by 2029, while her bull case pegs the stock price estimate at $3,100. Ms. Wood\u2019s bear case price target \u2014$2,000 \u2014 represents a whopping 982% upside potential based on TSLA\u2019s closing price of $184.86 on June 18.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush Securities, another Tesla bull, said the pay package issue resolution could begin a new chapter in Tesla\u2019s growth story. He reiterated an Outperform rating on the stock with a $350 price target.\n\nMusk's Pay Package Won't Solve Tesla's Growth Problems\n\nHowever, Tesla skeptics believe even if Elon Musk succeeds in getting his multibillion-dollar pay package, the core issues haunting Tesla won\u2019t get resolved on their own. They believe investors are banking too much on the upcoming Robotaxi event scheduled for Aug. 8, in which the company is expected to reveal its much-hyped Robotaxi, which Musk claimed would be without steering wheels or pedals. Tesla's renewed focus on Robotaxis comes after Musk reportedly canceled plans to build a mass-market, affordable EV in the range of $25,000.\n\nElon Musk is likely targeting the premium Robotaxi market, as the affordable EV segment is being dominated by Chinese competitors who are rolling out electric cars with budgets as low as $10,000 (for example, BYD\u2019s Seagull EV, which was revealed earlier this year).\n\nRobotaxis \"Years Away\" from Mass Adoption\n\nBut analysts don\u2019t expect Robotaxis to solve Tesla\u2019s growth problem. According to a Wall Street Journal report, RBC Capital analyst Tom Narayan thinks Robotaxis are likely \"years away from mass-market adoption.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd then there\u2019s competition, both at home and abroad. Last year, Chinese EV maker BYD Co. surpassed Tesla to become the world\u2019s (not only China\u2019s) biggest EV company.\n\nTesla's Valuation\n\nOver the past 18 months, Tesla has missed its sales estimates and announced price cuts, layoffs, and strategy shifts. In the first quarter, Tesla\u2019s profit fell 55%. Wall Street expects Tesla\u2019s earnings to fall about 17% this year. As of June 19, the stock is still trading at 74x forward earnings, much higher than the industry average multiple of 15.88.\n\nTesla is in a major transition phase, which, if it hits the mark, would take several months if not years to bear fruit. That\u2019s why there are better alternatives to look at if you are considering buying an EV stock.\n\nGeneral Motors Co (NYSE:GM): A Better Buy Than Tesla\n\nGeneral Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has become a formidable competitor to Tesla in the EV market while its gasoline engine continues to grow. Unlike Tesla, General Motors can play on both ends of the market, ramping up investments in internal combustion engine (ICE) cars amid strong demand as well as producing affordable EVs and positioning itself for the future. General Motors recently pledged to invest more in gas-powered trucks and sport-utility vehicles and indicated a decrease in futuristic projects like robotaxis. General Motors' iconic trucks, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, raked in strong sales in the first quarter as competitors Ford and Stellantis lost ground.\n\nThe stock recently hit 52-week highs as it announced a new $6 billion stock buyback program and increased its dividend by 33%.\n\nAnalysts believe General Motors is well on its way to becoming one of the biggest EV companies in the world. General Motors expects to produce 200,000 to 250,000 EVs this year, matching Wall Street's consensus estimate. The company recently launched Chevrolet Equinox, while its low-priced version is expected later this year. GM's EV production jumped 74% in the first quarter on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\n\nGeneral Motors reported strong Q1 results in April and increased its adjusted pretax profit outlook for the year from $12.5 billion to $14.5 billion, up from $12 billion to $14 billion. Net income in the year is now expected between $10.1 billion and $11.5 billion, above its previous guidance of $9.8 billion to $11.2 billion.\n\nDespite these growth catalysts and earnings upside, General Motors is trading at a forward P/E of 4.99, much lower than the industry median multiple of 17. This multiple is paltry when compared with Tesla's (74). With a dividend, a strong pipeline of EVs as well as a growing gasoline cars business, General Motors is a much better stock to buy when compared with Tesla.\n\nAre You Missing Out on Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.\n\nThis article Considering Buying Tesla Stock?

        "title": "General Motors' (GM) Cruise to Pay $112K to Restart Operation",
        "content": "General Motors\u2019 GM self-driving car subsidiary, Cruise, agreed to pay a $112,500 fine for failing to fully disclose details about an accident involving one of its robotaxis last year. This settlement allows Cruise to avoid litigation and resume operations in California.\r\n\r\nCruise and other self-driving vehicle companies like Alphabet Inc.'s GOOG Waymo and Amazon's Zoox have faced intense scrutiny from regulators due to safety concerns following multiple crashes involving their vehicles.\r\n\r\nPer the regulator, Cruise will pay $7,500 for each of the 15 days during which it withheld information about the incident.\r\n\r\nIn October 2023, a Cruise robotaxi was involved in an accident where it ran over a pedestrian who had been thrown into its path by another vehicle. The robotaxi then dragged the pedestrian 20 feet during a pullover maneuver. Cruise\u2019s staff failed to disclose these details during the investigations, leading to the revocation of the company's permits for operating driverless vehicles in California by both the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the Department of Motor Vehicles.\r\n\r\nGeneral Motors\u2019 subsidiary has implemented several corrective measures to address the CPUC's concerns following the incident. It hired a law firm, Quinn Emanuel, for an internal investigation, enhancing corporate transparency and making personnel changes, such as the departure of former CEO Kyle Vogt.\r\n\r\nPer the commission, Cruise has owned up to its past mistakes and assured greater transparency in future dealings with the agency.\r\n\r\nPer the settlement, Cruise must regularly share incident information with the CPUC, including increased collision reporting and monthly reports on incidents involving stopped autonomous vehicles that need physical retrieval. The company has been praised for seeking a swift resolution instead of engaging in lengthy legal processes.\r\n\r\nGM\u2019s subsidiary has been gradually returning to public roads in states with less regulatory supervision. Since April, the company has brought mini-fleets into operation with human safety operators in Phoenix, Houston and Dallas for mapping and testing purposes. Like Waymo, which is rapidly expanding its footprints in California, Cruise may adopt a similar approach. Cruise has an active permit from the Department of Motor Vehicles to test its vehicles with a safety driver.\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nGM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the auto space are Blue Bird Corporation BLBD and American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc. AXL, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe consensus estimate for BLBD\u2019s 2024 sales and earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 17.29% and 155.14%, respectively.

        "title": "Brokers Suggest Investing in General Motors (GM): Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about General Motors (GM).\n\nGeneral Motors currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.77, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 22 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.77 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 22 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 63.6% and 4.6% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GM Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for GM\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for General Motors here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying General Motors, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs GM Worth Investing In?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for General Motors, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $9.44.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for General Motors. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for General Motors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Hyundai Charges Ahead To Solidify Its EV Positioning Despite The Slowdown\n\nHyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF) announced the launch of\u00a0two new electric vehicles in Europe\u00a0in an effort to boost its market share. The two new models,\u00a0an affordable\u00a0EV\u00a0called the Inster EV,and a new IONIQ model, are key segment launches. While its\u00a0rivals, including traditional automakers like General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F), but also the EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) are scaling back their efforts, Hyundai is increasing its efforts to fight for\u00a0leadership in the EV era. According to data from the Korean Automobile & Mobility Association, May already brought some sales records.\n\nAffordable EVs Are In The Air\n\nLast week, Hyundai provided a teaser of its low-cost\u00a0EV for the first time, with the\u00a0official debut of the Inster EV\u00a0scheduled for\u00a0the Busan International Mobility\u00a0that is scheduled to\u00a0kick off on June 27th.\u00a0The Inster\u00a0is key to Hyundai\u2019s plan for EVs to account for\u00a0at least\u00a014 percent of\u00a0its\u00a0total sales in Europe this year. Volkswagen Group (OTC: VWAGY) also just finished design work on its affordable all-electric ID. 2. Volkswagen is expected to launch the ID.2. by the end of the year, while Hyundai\u2019s Inster EV will\u00a0make its official global debut\u00a0before June ends and Tesla is only talking about working on a low-cost EV. With the looming debut of its entry-level EV, Volkswagen promised the ID.2. turned out even better than the concept. It\u00a0will be\u00a0will be one of ten new EVs that Volkswagen plans to launch by 2027.\n\nHyundai Already Made A\u00a0Record In\u00a0May\n\nIn May,\u00a0IONIQ 5 set a\u00a0new monthly sales record with\u00a04,449 units sold, bringing the cumulative total of the first five months of 2024 to\u00a0nearly 15,000\u00a0units. Kia also made its own record as it\u00a0sold 7,766 electric SUVs through May, while it also expects to gain the\u00a0$7,500 tax credit\u00a0and further boost demand. Later this year,\u00a0Hyundai is opening its first EV and battery plant in the US\u00a0and once it\u00a0begins\u00a0assembling the IONIQ 5,\u00a0it should also have a contender to\u00a0qualify for the tax credit.Already, the IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6, are some of the most affordable and efficient EVs on the market, with the upcoming IONIQ yet to be unveiled.\n\nHyundai and Kia show South Korean automakers have what it takes for the EV race.\n\nHyundai started off 2024 on a good note or more precisely, with a record start. In May, it sold more than 17,000 EVs across the globe. In the U.S., it is even challenging the EV king, Tesla. In May, Hyundai Motor Group that includes Kia, made 11.2% of the EV market in the U.S. By hitting double digits in market share, Hyundai and Kia are getting closer to close the gap with Tesla.\u00a0While Tesla led by 52.9%\u00a0last year, the gap fell to\u00a040.5% through May\u00a0this year as Hyundai continues to grow its\u00a0market share. Although the fall of Tesla and its market share was bound to happen at some point, figures show that Hyundai and Kia are doing something right with their EV offerings and strategies.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "General Motors Company (GM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "General Motors (GM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this an automotive manufacturer have returned +9.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors falls in, has gained 3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, General Motors is expected to post earnings of $2.67 per share, indicating a change of +39.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $9.44 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +22.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.51 indicates a change of +0.8% from what General Motors is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for General Motors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor General Motors, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $44.94 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $174.72 billion and $175.39 billion estimates indicate +1.7% and +0.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGeneral Motors reported revenues of $43.01 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.6%. EPS of $2.62 for the same period compares with $2.21 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.29 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.18%. The EPS surprise was +25.96%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGeneral Motors is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Stocks Ready to Rev Up Returns With Buyback Boosts Like GM",
        "content": "Are you looking for stocks to buy for buyback boosts?\n\nOn June 11, General Motors (NYSE:GM) announced a new $6 billion stock buyback program. That was on top of the accelerated share repurchase it did last November, and there was $1.4 billion left from its previous share repurchase plan. It is certainly an option.\n\nIn terms of dividends and share repurchases, GM returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in 2022, plus $11.6 billion last year. It expects to return $1.7 billion in the first six months of 2024 through June 30.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile the auto maker is a big buyer of its stock, it\u2019s not the largest in the S&P 500 by any means.\n\nWhat makes a good buyback? Generally, it\u2019s when excess cash is returned to shareholders when all other levers have been exhausted, such as dividends, debt repayment, acquisitions and internal investments in its business operations.\n\nWho are the good share repurchasers? Here are three companies that are doing it right.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced its quarterly earnings May 2. They exceeded analyst expectations. However, it was the iPhone maker\u2019s plan to buy back an additional $110 billion of its stock that got investors excited.\n\nNot only was it the largest buyback in U.S. history, it exceeded its own record of $100 billion set in May 2018. In fact, Apple accounts for six of the 10 largest. Apple\u2019s six share repurchase announcements add up to $555 billion since 2018.\n\n\u201c\u2018An astonishing number,\u2019 said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers LLC. \u2018Apple may be acknowledging that they are becoming a value stock that returns money to shareholders rather than a high powered growth stock that needs its cash for R&D or expansion,\u2019\u201d Bloomberg reported on May 2.\n\nWhile we know it generates a ton of cash from its business, it\u2019s vital that Apple be smart with its excess cash outlays for its shares.\n\nIn fiscal 2018 (September year-end), Apple bought back 405.1 million of its shares for $73.1 billion, an average price of $180.45. However, on a post-split basis \u2014 its shares split four-for-1 in August 2020 \u2014 it was $45.11. That\u2019s a compound annual growth rate of 29.7% over the past six years.\n\nAAPL investors have been loving these buyback boosts. I would gladly take that kind of annual return on my investments.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported Q2 2024 results on June 13. They beat the analyst estimates with sales of $5.31 billion and earnings of $4.48 a share, which was 9 cents better than the consensus.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe quarter was so strong that it raised its outlook for the year to $18.10 a share in earnings on $21.45 billion in revenue. The earnings outlook is 10 cents above analyst expectations. Its shares jumped 15% on the news.\n\nOn March 14, Adobe announced a new stock repurchase plan for $25 billion, good through March 14, 2028. That\u2019s approximately 11% of its outstanding shares.\n\n\u201cOur new $25 billion share repurchase authorization underscores what a special company Adobe is, with the profitability and cash flows to drive growth and invest in innovation while returning significant capital to our shareholders,\u201d said Dan Durn, executive vice president and CFO, Adobe.\n\nIn the second quarter, it repurchased $2.5 billion of its stock at an average price of $543.48, higher than its current share price. However, in fiscal 2023 (November year-end), it repurchased $4.61 billion of its stock at an average price of $400.87, a return of 30.3% in less than a year.\u00a0This makes ADBE a stock to consider for buyback boosts.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) The back of a Caterpillar (CAT) work vehicle displaying company logo\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) announced on June 12 that it was adding $20 billion to its 2022 share repurchase authorization, which has no expiry. It now has $21.8 billion to repurchase its shares.\n\nIn its announcement, the company said that it would return most of the free cash flow from its Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) segment to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Caterpillar has paid a dividend since 1933 and is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index.\n\nIn the first quarter, Caterpillar paid $5.1 billion in dividends and share repurchases. In 2023, it repurchased $4.98 billion of its stock and paid out $2.56 billion in dividends. The company\u2019s average price paid for shares repurchased was $255.83. That\u2019s a return on investment of over 27% in less than one year.\n\nThe $20 billion share repurchase added to its existing plan is nearly 13% of its shares outstanding.\n\nIts ME&T free cash flow in 2023 was $10.03 billion, nearly double what it was a year earlier. It paid 75% of that for dividends and share repurchases.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are at the forefront of innovation in transportation. Unlike gas-fueled cars, they can cause less harm to the planet while oftentimes being cheaper due to subsidies. Looking at the industry\u2019s current and expected growth, it is clear that EVs are here to stay. Just by 2030, a short six years from now, 50% of cars sold in the U.S. will likely be EVs, and the industry is expected to grow at a compounding annual growth rate of around 18% up until 2030, representing a huge upside. In order to be a part of the revolution that EVs will cause, below are the best EV stocks to buy.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) has been one of the leaders in the automobile industry, and it is now investing heavily in the electric vehicle market. Last year, GM sold 75,000 electric vehicles. While the sales came largely short of its initial 150,000 EV goals, GM still plans to delve aggressively into the EV segment. By 2025, GM will have spent over 35 billion in EV and AV investments, a 75% increase from its pre-COVID plan.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of GM\u2019s electric vehicle sales is its retail partnership. For instance, GM has an Auto Program with Costco (NASDAQ:COST), which makes it easier for GM to reach consumers and amass sales. Costco members would get a special discount when purchasing GM electric vehicles, and considering that there are more than 50 million active Costco members in the U.S., the partnership opens a market expansion opportunity for GM.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 5.80x, GM offers an excellent investment opportunity for those looking for undervalued EV stocks.\n\nXpeng\u00a0(XPEV) XPeng (XPEV) car logo in Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition\n\nSource: THINK A / Shutterstock.com\n\nXpeng (NYSE:XPEV) is a Chinese EV company that started in Guangzhou, China. Although this Chinese EV startup is a relatively small player in the market, it has one of the greater growth potentials among numerous EV makers. Even though the stock has been performing poorly this year, Xpeng has promising news on both financial and nonfinancial ends that will convince investors the stock will bounce back.\n\nOne of the main strategies Xpeng will implement in the near future is its shift into more affordable and mass-market models instead of current models targeting the high-end EV market. The company also announced it will launch more than 10 new models in the next 3 years.\n\nFinancially, Xpeng is a buy. With gross margins of 13%, there is hope of them eventually reaching profitability. Many EV companies have negative gross margins, leading to large negative net margins \u2014 though Xpeng\u2019s 13% is a positive sign. Its revenue is also up a massive 62% year-over-year, showing the company is not slowing down and still has significant upside left. As its growth continues, margins will improve, and so will the conditions of the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) is currently the largest EV company in the world, even bigger than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), owning an 18% market share of the entire industry. BYD\u2019s business model is a success story that has propelled the company to its current position. Through the use of vertical integration, the company profits from multiple aspects of EVs, providing its own batteries, and even its own computer chips. Through large investments in innovation, BYD is trying to keep the top EV spot. One recent project was an investment of $1.4 billion that guarantees the production of 720,000 power device products and 6 billion optical microelectronic products.\n\nAfter taking a look at the financials, BYD is clearly a buy. The company is growing at a very rapid rate. In just one of the quarters last fiscal year, the company experienced year-over-year growth of 67%, showing massive potential for continued expansion. BYD is also profitable, which makes growing easier as profits can be reinvested to give the company an edge. Many EV companies are unprofitable, though this one can still consistently keep its net profit margin in the black.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tomas Levani did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "EV Slowdown Might Be Undebatable But EV Innovation Is Unstoppable\n\nAt the beginning of June, Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ: RIVN) announced the redesign of its\u00a0its all-electric R1 pickup and SUV models. By using Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) chips, Rivian improved the range, performance and computing power of its vehicles. Rivian already made history by bringing the world\u2019s first all-electric pickup to the road, beating even the EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) whose long-anticipated Cybertruck came to life a while after. But, the EV concept continues to evolve as the automotive industry continues its all-electric transformation and EV makers need to evolve along with it.\n\nRivian revamped its R1S and R1T with the help of Nvidia.\n\nEveryone, especially traditional automakers like General Motors, (NYSE: GM), Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM), know very well that unlike internal combustion engine vehicles, EVs are more about software than hardware. But, Rivian even changed more than half the hardware components,\u00a0although\u00a0the 2025\u00a0models\u00a0do not outwardly look too different than the current\u00a0ones. Besides pushing the technical boundaries of its second-generation\u00a0products\u00a0further,Rivian\u00a0reengineered their batteries and electrical architectures,\u00a0known as the\u00a0brains of a vehicle, while adding\u00a0driver-assistant features\u00a0through the\u00a0new system\u00a0that\u00a0uses dual Nvidia DRIVE Orin processors. Like Tesla, Rivian also plans to launch a less-expensive EV, with the less expensive variation of R2 models expected to start at about\u00a0$45,000\u00a0upon their launch in the first half of 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, electric pickups are in for a treat this summer with the launch of the Alpha version of the world\u2019s first solar-powered tonneau cover SOLIS. Made by\u00a0Worksport\u00ae Ltd. (NASDAQ: WKSP),together with a COR portable battery system, the power duo promises to extend the range of electric pickups and much more, considering the capability to offer off-grid power-on-the-go. Worksport just reported its best sales month ever,\u00a0achieving $739,417\u00a0in May, which alone is\u00a0332%\u00a0higher to the monthly average from the first quarter, whose overall sales of\u00a0$512,637 was also surpassed.\u00a0Worksport reported its sales surged due to\u00a0its Made-in-America portfolio whose\u00a0scaled production\u00a0kicked off in January. Worksport also recently received\u00a0the \u2018Innovator of the Year' award in Western New York\u00a0as its products promise to revolutionize the market, which is expected to translate to significant market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nDifficult times often bring out the greatest inventions.\n\nAs the saying goes, one can cut all the flowers one cannot stop Spring from coming. Same can be said for innovation that happens even during the most challenging times as this is when it is most needed.\u00a0The EV slowdown might in the air all year long, but Rivian getting the power of Nvidia and Worksport bringing in solar power to the table are examples that show the EV evolution is not showing any signs of stopping, as even unfavorable macroeconomic conditions cannot stop innovation.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "3 Lithium Stocks That Can Make Millionaires by 2030",
        "content": "Lithium stocks have plunged on the back of a steep correction in lithium. It\u2019s worth noting that the markets tend to react to the extremes. Currently, the sentiment for lithium stocks is bearish, and quality stocks seem deeply undervalued. I believe this is a golden opportunity to consider some lithium stocks to buy for the long term.\n\nThe most important point to note is that the correction in lithium is temporary. Analysts expect that by the end of 2025, there will be a \u201cmodest deficit\u201d of 40,000 to 60,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent. Further, the deficit is expected to increase to 768,000 tonnes by the end of 2030.\n\nIf this estimate holds true, the upside in lithium is likely to be significant in the next five years. This will also translate into a big rally for some of the best lithium stocks. This column focuses on three lithium stocks to buy that have the potential to make millionaires by the end of the decade.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrom October 2023, when it reached a high of $12.4, Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) stock plunged to its current level of $2.8. The big correction is a golden buying opportunity for long-term investors. Once sentiments reverse, I expect LAC stock to skyrocket from deeply undervalued levels.\n\nTo put things into perspective, Lithium Americas commands a market valuation of $610 million. This seems miniscule when compared to the Thacker Pass asset potential. The lithium asset is estimated to have an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion. Once production commences in 2027, the asset will likely deliver robust EBITDA and free cash flows.\n\nOne concern last year was related to financing the construction of the project. In 2023, General Motors (NYSE:GM) signed an agreement to infuse $650 million in liquidity in two tranches.\n\nHowever, the major financing development came this year, with the U.S. Department of Energy providing a conditional commitment for a $2.26 billion loan. Additionally, Lithium Americas diluted equity to raise $275 million. Therefore, the focus in 2024 and beyond is likely to be on completing the project within the stipulated time.\n\nPiedmont Lithium (PLL) Person holding cellphone with logo of US mining company Piedmont Lithium Inc. (PLL) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nPiedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) is another lithium miner trading at a massive valuation gap. PLL stock has plunged 83% in the last 12 months and looks oversold. I would expect a sharp bounce-back from current levels.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Piedmont Lithium has a current market valuation of $210 million. The company\u2019s Quebec assets (25% ownership) have an after-tax NPV of $250 million. The NPV of the smallest asset is higher than the current market valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, the Carolina, Tennessee and Ghana assets have a combined after-tax NPV of $5.2 billion. PLL stock is deeply undervalued, and 20x to 30x returns from current levels are likely in the long term.\n\nIn my view, there are two catalysts for a sharp reversal rally. First, lithium trending higher after a deep correction. Further, Piedmont is securing financing for its assets in Carolina and Tennessee (both 100% ownership). Both these assets promise a steady-state annual EBITDA of $835 million.\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) is among the bigger names in the industry. However, ALB stock has not been spared and has corrected by 57% in the last 12 months. A part of the correction has been due to equity dilution in March, when the company raised $2.3 billion.\n\nWith Albemarle focused on conserving cash and maintaining a strong balance sheet, it\u2019s a good time to accumulate. For 2024, Albemarle has guided for $280 million in productivity benefits.\n\nRegarding fundamentals, Albemarle reported a liquidity buffer of $3.7 billion as of March. Further, with low leverage, Albemarle will likely emerge from challenging times with high financial flexibility.\n\nThis will allow Albemarle to make aggressive investments in lithium recovery. I must add that between 2022 and 2027, Albemarle has maintained its guidance for lithium sales volume growth at a CAGR of 20%. Once lithium trends are higher, the volume growth will translate into a significant upside in cash flows.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Electric Vehicle Stocks That Perform Better Than Their Fossil Fuel Counterparts",
        "content": "Believe it or not, electric vehicles do outperform their fossil fuel counterparts in some ways. From the perspective of sheer performance, that most obviously manifests as dramatically faster acceleration times. EV stocks to buy also outperform their fossil fuel counterparts in several important ways.\n\nI\u2019ll explain that in more depth throughout the article but it essentially all boils down to pricing. The average cost of an electric vehicle was greater than $55,000 in April 2024. The average\u00a0price for a new gasoline-powered vehicle was just below $45,000.\n\nHigher prices generally lead to higher margins, creating all kinds of strong business economics in the process. Although the price gap between EVs and gasoline-powered vehicles is narrowing, it is still significant, creating appreciable margins.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat simple fact is a strong reason to believe that the EV stocks to buy discussed below have a significant advantage over their\u00a0non-EV competitors.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is arguably one of the most maligned stocks best positioned to reward investors at the moment. Everyone is aware that Tesla is under substantial pressure to reduce its prices on its vehicles to become more competitive. That has caused a lot of fear around the EV industry in general.\n\n2023 was a year marked by tremendous slowdowns in EV sales activity overall. Tesla\u2019s revenues grew by more than 51% in 2022. Sales grew by less than 19% in 2023. 19% sales growth, as strong as it sounds, is still comparatively weaker.\n\nHowever, that still equates to overall gross margins above 18%. Those are well above margins at Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM), and in line with those fromToyota (NYSE:TM).\n\nIn other words, Tesla performed as well as Toyota in 2023. That\u2019s hardly bad company to keep and still puts Tesla far ahead of the other big gasoline vehicle manufacturers. Those companies are also proving particularly poor at producing EVs, losing lots of money in the process.\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) stock is entering a period of strength as it perfects its profitability recipe.\n\nThe company continues to mature and is recording margins above the 20% level. That puts its performance in that regard above Tesla. The other important thing to note is that BYD is actually the biggest producer of EVs globally. The company produced more than three million vehicles in 2023, beating Tesla for the second straight year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, BYD stands out as an EV stock to buy with a very strong combination of strong internal economics and incredible volume.\n\nThe result\u00a0is an opportunity for investors. EV stocks continue to be maligned in general. While the average investor sits around bickering about EVs and how gasoline vehicles are always better, consider BYD\u2019s unique advantages.\n\nThe company\u2019s already carved out a massive share of the market overall. BYD has a bright future ahead of it. And it\u2019s currently undervalued. Based on the factors that I just discussed, it\u2019s hard to find a better EV stock to buy anywhere.\n\nON Semiconductor (ON) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is among the most competitive chip companies and chip stocks overall.\n\nCompetitiveness usually manifests as an ability to sell your products at higher prices than your competitors while keeping costs low. The result is high margins. ON Semiconductor certainly has high margins, better than roughly 81% of all publicly listed chipmakers.\n\nOne of the reasons ON Semiconductor has been so successful is that it has carved out a niche as a chip provider to the electric vehicle industry. The company is currently applying some of the technological know-how it developed in manufacturing those chips to the AI industry. The company believes it may be able to increase AI chip efficiency by utilizing its silicon carbide technology.\n\nIf so, it\u2019s logical to assume that ON Semiconductor\u2019s margins will rise even higher as a result of higher chip prices due to AI demand. Beyond all of those positives, it should also be noted that ON Semiconductor stock is highly regarded and has substantial potential above its current price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "General Motors Company (GM): Does this Feminist Stock Remain Well-positioned Despite the Setbacks?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Feminist Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) stands against the other feminist stocks.\n\nWith the passage of time, the role of women in the modern day workplace has slowly started to grow. In less than a century, more women not only lead companies but are also among some of the wealthiest individuals in the world. At the same time, women have demonstrated that they are equal to men when it comes to disrupting industries. One of the best examples of this phenomena is America\u2019s best known rocket company SpaceX. While SpaceX is famous for its founder and billionaire Elon Musk, the firm\u2019s chief operations officer and president Gwynne Shotwell has been equally responsible for its massive success in the rocket industry which has dislodged decades of monopolies held by a few defense contractors.\n\nIn fact, this rising trend of women leading the charge at some of the biggest companies in the world has also generated interesting statistics when it comes to compensation. Data from Equilar shows that in 2023, out of the 341 CEOs part of the study, 25 were women. Their median pay package stood at $17.6 million, which according to Equilar, was 7.7% higher than the figure for the complete data set. At the same time, the 25 female CEOs saw five new executives added to the list when compared to 2022.\n\nConsidering this, it would appear that the gender pay gap in the US appears to be narrowing. To confirm this, we\u2019ll have to look at the pay statistics for the entire country as opposed to only S&P 500 CEOs. Well, on this front, data gathered by Pew shows that there\u2019s a lot to be done. The research firm points out that in 2002, women earned 80% of what men were paid. Two decades later, i.e. in 2022, this stood at 82%, indicating that there\u2019s a lot more to be done to decrease the wage gap between the two genders. However, at the same time, younger women might be changing these trends. This is because according to Pew, women aged between 25 and 34 earned 92% of their male counterparts, which is quite higher than the figure of 86% in 2002.\n\nWith these details in mind, we decided to take a look at the best feminist stocks to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best feminist stocks to invest in, we ranked publicly traded Fortune 500 companies with female CEOs by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nA group of technicians in a garage, inspecting car parts and ensuring safety compliance.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q1 2024: 78\n\nCEO: Mary T. Barra\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is one of the oldest and most iconic car manufacturers in America. Amidst a tumultuous couple of months which have seen General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) resume its autonomous driving efforts and settle disputes with unions for a battery manufacturing facility. Citi kept its Buy rating for the shares and a $96 share price target in June 2024. The two key reasons behind the sustained optimism even as General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) has struggled in the EV industry are Citi\u2019s belief that the US auto industry is robust and the car maker\u2019s $11 billion share buyback. Between Q2 2024 and 2025, Citi now expects $7.1 billion in share buybacks which is significantly higher than the earlier estimate of $6.3 billion in buybacks.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM)\u2019s forward price to earnings ratio is just 5.02, which is less than 4x the S&P 500\u2019s reading. This shouldn\u2019t fool you though. We remember\u00a0David Einhorn pitching GM at an investment conference more than 10 years ago and telling investors that GM\u2019s PE ratio is 8 and it is an extremely cheap stock. If GM\u2019s true PE ratio was really 8 and the company was managed by talented individuals, they would have bought back enough shares to buy 1.5 GMs in 12 years. GM is still an \u201cextremely\u201d cheap company after 12 years and it underperformed the market S&P 500 Index during this period. GM\u2019s market cap is around $50 billion, but it also has nearly $100 billion in net debt. It is a risky stock with a bankruptcy in its history. Unless General Motors\u2019 management demonstrates a clear commitment to prioritizing shareholder interests over those of employees, we remain cautious about the GM stock.\n\nDiamond Hill Capital mentioned the firm in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\nAutomobile manufacturer General Motors continues capitalizing on the shift to electric vehicles (EVs) while maintaining the strength of its core gas-engine truck and SUV business. Though it has experienced some setbacks \u2014 such as needing to roll back its Cruise driverless car project \u2014 we believe the company remains well-positioned relative to secular tailwinds within the automobile business.\n\nOverall PH ranks 5th on our list of the best feminist stocks to buy. You can visit 11 Best Feminist Stocks To Invest Into see the other feminist stocks that are on hedge funds' radar. While we acknowledge the potential of GM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 EV Stocks to Buy as the Electric Vehicle Market Revs Back Up",
        "content": "The global electric vehicle (EV) market has suffered more than anyone ever imagined it would. While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to make news, there is so much more going on in the EV industry. The sales have slowed over the past few months, and EV makers have already addressed this issue by cutting down on the production targets, which ultimately impacted EV stocks. However, there is a bright side to the current situation for investors looking for EV stocks to buy.\n\nThe U.S. has incentivized the purchase of EVs through tax subsidies and grants. While the EV market is not expected to pick up anytime soon, one cannot deny the future is electric. Sooner or later, people will have to transition towards electric vehicles. Developing nations like India have started to see higher demand and adoption of EVs over the past year. If you can take a little risk and have the patience to hold onto your stock until the market improves, here are three stocks to buy.\n\nEV Stocks to Buy: BYD (BYDDF) BYD Company Limited logo in front of their website. BYDDY stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nIn the period between Jan and May 2024, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) continued to hold the largest share in China\u2019s EV market, taking the crown from Tesla. It holds a 33.4% passenger market share in China, with retail sales of 268,226 vehicles in May.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDuring this period, the company\u2019s sales rose by 20% year over year (YOY), giving it a top spot in the industry. Trading at $29 today, the stock is up 8% year-to-date (YTD) but down 11% in the past 12 months. BYDDF has become one of the best EV stocks to buy.\n\nBYD is a global powerhouse that is expanding at a rapid pace. Besides holding the largest market share for batteries, the company also beat Tesla in EV deliveries in 2023. The company is now entering the electric bus market in London and intends to replace the Boris Bus.\n\nBYD doesn\u2019t have to worry about the high tariff concerns in the U.K. It has ample space to grow in Europe and will have the lowest additional tax levy. That means BYD can also enjoy pricing power in Europe and expand its market share. It is currently building a factory in Europe and will export to the E.U.\n\nThe company is also building a factory in Hungary, making it the first Chinese automaker to build cars in Europe. The biggest benefit that BYD has is its global presence. It is already an established player in the industry and is set to benefit once the market revs up. Citi(NYSE:C) opened a 30-day upside catalyst watch and has a Buy rating for the stock.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nA top 2023 EV stock, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) had a very slow start to 2024. Having reported impressive delivery numbers and fundamentals, the company saw a drop in EV demand, leading to lower production and sales.\n\nHowever, I think Li Auto is one of the best EV players out there. LI stock is trading for $18 today and has lost 49% of its value since the beginning of the year. The EV maker is focused on SUVs and enjoys a price advantage. The company started delivering EVs in 2019 and saw a tremendous upside in 2023. That allowed the company to turn profitable last year, and analysts are expecting to see a steady revenue increase this year.\n\nThe company delivered a total of 80,400 cars in the first quarter and delivered nearly 61,000 vehicles in April and May combined. Li Auto is not the one to sit back and wait for the industry to improve. Instead, it is scaling up production, working on new marketing campaigns and ramping up the Mega shipments.\n\nIt recently launched the Li L6. The company will also be investing over 6 billion yuan in building 5,000 charging stations. While the process may take time, it will open a new revenue line for the business. The company is profitable, setting it apart from several other EV companies.\n\nAn improvement in the macro environment could boost the EV market, and Li Auto will be the first one to benefit. Once the sales stabilize, there is no going back for the company. LI is one of the best EV stocks to buy.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutomaker General Motors (NYSE:GM) has been in the industry for many years and has seen several market ups and downs. The company is investing heavily in the EV segment and managed to deliver 75,000 EVs last year and 9,500 EVs in May this year.\n\nIt has committed to invest $35 billion in the sector in 2024. Once the economy recovers, we could see General Motors report tremendous growth. It managed to sell a total of 2.6 million cars last year, which shows its strong position in the auto industry\n\nIt saw a 21% jump in EV retail customer deliveries in the first quarter and has ambitious goals to produce 200,000 and 300,000 EVs this year. The management announced a $6 billion share repurchase plan and also hiked its dividend by 33% in the quarter. General Motors is doing well as compared to its competitors, who are bleeding cash due to the slow EV demand.\n\nWhile the company has slowed down EV production, it will manage to return cash to shareholders. Once the market picks up, GM will be ready with its lineup. It is aiming to end gas-powered vehicle sales by 2035. The management will invest $850 million in Cruise, the self-driving car subsidiary this month to relaunch it.\n\nTrading at $47, the stock is up 33% YTD and is very close to its 52-week high of $49. The stock still looks undervalued to me and is a buy below $50.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Amidst positive market trends and robust financial performance, several analysts have rated strong buy auto stocks to capitalize on the industry\u2019s growth.\n\nThe auto sector is well on its way to a strong recovery this year after a rough 2023. Much of this optimism is driven by the shift in market conditions with increasing supply and declining prices. Analysts predict this will be a tailwind for auto stocks, creating numerous investment opportunities that are too promising to overlook.\n\nA second catalyst for the industry is the electrification of cars. While the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is still in its early days, concerns over climate change give us good reason to believe that there will be a turnaround. Companies are making major advancements in EV technology to keep up with this anticipated demand.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs the auto industry experiences a paradigm shift, driven by changing market conditions and technological breakthroughs, there is no better time to get behind highly rated names in the sector.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) 2024 Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup truck at the New York Auto Show. GM stock.\n\nSource: quiggyt4 / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors\u2019 (NYSE:GM) stock is on an upward trajectory after announcing a 33% increase in its dividend and a $10 billion share repurchase program earlier this year. The auto giant is appealing to its investors once again with an additional $6 billion in stock buybacks.\n\nThe news of the share buyback is reflective of GM\u2019s increased profitability and commitment to rewarding shareholders for their loyalty. The company hopes to keep this momentum going through the fiscal year with annual earnings expected to increase by 22%.\n\nAs anticipated, shares of the company gained 1.35% on announcing the share buyback program, and analysts reiterated their optimism toward GM stock. Among the positive sentiments was that of Bank of America, which reissued its buy rating, projecting a 53.48% upside on its current price.\n\nCiti also maintained its buy rating, stating that recent proprietary surveys indicate a resilient, strong U.S. auto market, which further bolstered its confidence in the stock\u2019s performance. The bank holds its target price for GM stock at $96.\n\nGeneral Motors\u2019 commitment to expanding the bottom line and rewarding shareholders through its buyback programs makes this one of the top strong buy auto stocks on the market.\n\nCarvana (CVNA) Tower of Carvana cars in a 'car vending machine.'\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to auto stocks, the online used car giant Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) has become an investor favorite in recent months. After years of battling high logistical and fixed costs, the company developed a two-step cost and debt restructuring plan. This put it on a path of profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe results of these initiatives came to fruition in Q1 of 2024 when the company reported the best financial results in its history. Now with its troubles in the rearview mirror, analyst and investor sentiments towards this stock are at an all-time high.\n\nIn its most recent earnings, Carvana reported revenue of $3.1 billion, up from $2.7 billion a year ago. However, its most impressive metric was its net income of $49 million over a net loss from the same quarter a year ago. The company raised income levels by optimizing its tech operations and prioritizing vehicle reconditioning.\n\nWhile Carvana is still actively working to control debt levels, its ability to successfully cut costs signals brighter days ahead. If the company plays its cards right, it could be a huge winner in the next decade.\n\nAnalysts seem to agree, anticipating a double digit upside for CVNA stock at the $115 to $125 range.\n\nThe company\u2019s impressive turnaround story makes this one of the best strong buy stocks in the auto sector today.\n\nFerrari (RACE) Ferarri car on the streets of France.\n\nSource: Hadrian / Shutterstock\n\nFerrari (NYSE:RACE) is perhaps most well known for its sports cars, but the company holds a strong lead in the luxury goods market. The diversity of its brand, which many consider a status symbol, has helped maintain its loyal customer base through good and bad times. A prime example of this: RACE stock took a hit after its recent quarterly earnings but still received a positive rating from Bernstein analysts.\n\nInvestor sentiment toward Ferrari stock waned after the company\u2019s delivery numbers took a hit in Q1. Across the region of Taiwan and China with Hong Kong, shipments dropped by 20% and remained flat globally compared to last year. However, analysts kept their weight behind the stock for its strong baseline performance. Ferrari reported a 11% uptick in revenue and maintained its revenue guidance at $6.4 billion. This was below analyst estimates but a 4% growth versus the prior year.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, RACE stock has a consensus buy rating with 22 analysts giving it a buy rating.\n\nFerrari is a name that deserves a spot in your wallet. Its unique position in the luxury goods market and strong financials makes RACE one of the best strong buy auto stocks on the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Rivian Automotive has been charting a path toward recovery, making it one of the top EV stocks to buy now. It has bounced back impressively in recent quarters, fueled by promising developments and renewed investor interest.\n\nThe EV upstart has shown solid progress in ramping up delivery volumes and moving toward profitability. Additionally, it unveiled next-generation versions of its R1S SUV and R1T truck models, likely to be a major growth catalyst ahead. Moreover, rumors swirling over a potential partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the anticipated launch of its more affordable R2 models are stoking investor enthusiasm.\n\nHowever, Rivian\u2019s not the only EV stock that\u2019s worth betting on at this time. The industry is up against multiple headwinds, but these three are among the best EV stocks to buy now. Coupled with Rivian, these dynamic EV stocks should build a superb portfolio poised for long-term growth and exciting returns ahead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) is arguably the most compelling EV story. Defying current market headwinds, it has effectively transformed from a top-tier battery maker to a juggernaut in the EV space.\n\nThe firm\u2019s strategy revolves around blending accessibility with affordability, allowing it to effectively dominate the Chinese market. However, it\u2019s not stopping there. It\u2019s set on dominating the global EV scene, revving its presence everywhere, from Europe to Southeast Asia.\n\nRecent results have been tremendous despite industry challenges. Sales of new energy vehicles were up 38.1%, totaling 331,817 units in May. This includes a 54.1% rise in plug-in hybrid sales and a 22.4% boost in battery electric vehicles.\n\nAlso, introducing new models like the \u2018Shark\u2019 pickup truck and the budget-friendly \u2018Seagull\u2019 EV underscores its stellar long-term bull case. BYD is effectively laying the groundwork for sustained dominance in the EV realm.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is a trailblazer in the Chinese EV market, and it stands out for its robust bottom-line position. Unlike most of its peers domestically and globally, Li Auto has been consistently profitable on a gross profit basis since 2020. Moreover, it swung from a $292 million loss in 2022 to rake in a cool $1.65 billion net income last year.\n\nFurthermore, its recent financials underscore its stellar upward trajectory. Despite the relatively muted performance in Q1, it expects to deliver between 105,000 to 110,000 vehicles in the second quarter, roughly a 21.3% to 27.1% increase from the prior-year period. Last month\u2019s results, in particular, underscore its bright outlook ahead. It posted a 23.8% increase in car deliveries year-over-year (YOY) to 35,020 vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs we advance, Li Auto is laser-focused on dominating the Chinese market through model innovation and next-generation autonomous driving technology. It also plans to invest over 6 billion yuan in building 5,000 charging stations, significantly boosting its service network while opening up a lucrative new income stream.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is one of the biggest names in the automotive industry, and it continues to navigate the weaknesses in the EV space. In doing so, the automotive giant is looking to advance its hybrid technologies effectively in tandem with its expansive EV and autonomous vehicle projects.\n\nIn 2023, the firm delivered over 75,000 EVs and projected a substantial increase between 200,000 and 300,000 EVs this year. Bolstering its commitment further, GM plans to invest a whopping $35 billion in its EV initiatives through the current year, along with major investments in its powerful Ultium EV platform, including enhancements in its connected vehicle services.\n\nFinancially, GM remains in excellent shape, marked by robust agility and growth potential. It reported an 8% YOY increase in sales for Q1, hitting $43 billion. This substantial growth was accompanied by a hefty 19% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.62, prompting an optimistic revision of its full-year financial outlook.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either\u00a0directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Why automakers are backtracking on their ambitious EV game plans",
        "content": "As summer unfolds with spring in the rear-view mirror, sales staff at car dealerships across the country are clearing out inventory to make way for the new 2025 models coming in the fall.\n\nBut one car group is still clogging up dealer lots: EVs. The relatively high cost of EVs, range anxiety, and American consumer preference for hybrids are a few factors to blame.\n\nThe latest data from S&P Mobility finds that EV inventory at the end of April climbed 5.7% compared to the prior month and rose 105% compared to a year ago. This despite steep discounting for EVs through most of the year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough sledding out there,\u201d Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said.\n\nEV-only startups are especially feeling the pain. California-based Fisker just filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday. Its demise follows Lordstown Motors' filing only a year ago.\n\nGiven that automakers other than Tesla are selling EVs at a loss, it's not surprising car manufacturers across the board have been backtracking. Last week, Ford (F) CFO John Lawler said COVID boosted EV sales. But once those buyers and early adopters were accounted for, the broader group of buyers failed to jump in. A Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles are shown on a dealership lot, Wednesday, May 29, 2024, in Salem, N.H. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, Pool) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nMainstream buyers are \"not willing to put up with some of the other issues that you might have with an EV around range and those types of things,\u201d Lawler told Yahoo Finance .\u201cI think you're going to see the growth continue, [but] it's going be a little bit slower than what we've seen in the past.\u201d\n\nLawler believes Ford\u2019s second-generation EVs are where the company will see profitability, but those vehicles won\u2019t be coming until late 2025 or 2026 at the earliest. Meanwhile, the company said back in April it was pushing back EV production at its massive BlueOval City EV campus in Tennessee to 2026 from its initial 2025 start date. It also shared that Ford was \u201cretiming\u201d the launch of upcoming EVs.\n\nGM (GM) is plotting a similar strategy. The company has backed away from its initial big EV plans, with CFO Paul Jacobson revealing at a Deutsche Bank conference that GM now expects to produce 200,000 to 250,000 EVs this year, slightly lower than the 200,000 to 300,000 unit plan. GM at one point projected a production run on as many as 400,000 EVs this year.\n\nStill, Jacobson told Yahoo Finance at the conference, \u201cWe're picking up significant [EV market] share; we sold over 9,500 EVs in North America last month.\" The Chevrolet Blazer and Cadillac LYRIQ EV had \u201creally strong gains,\u201d Jacobson added.\n\nThe moves by Ford and GM follow similar pivots from Big Three rival Stellantis (STLA), which paused development of a joint venture battery factory with Mercedes (STLA), and instead signed a deal with China\u2019s Leapmotor to build EVs.\n\nStory continues\n\nMercedes pivoted hard from its plan to be all-electric by 2030, with the German luxury automaker seeing only 50% of sales being \u201celectrified\u201d \u2014 meaning both hybrids and full EVs \u2014 by 2030.\n\nGermany\u2019s Volkswagen (VOW3.DE) has also pulled back. For instance, the company canceled the US release of its ID.7 EV sedan last month. Customers \u201cwant plug-in hybrids now, including in China and the US,\u201d Volkswagen Passenger Cars CEO Thomas Sch\u00e4fer said in an interview at a conference in London, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nHow did automakers get the EV timing wrong? Visitors at the New York International Auto Show in New York last March. (Liu Yanan/Xinhua via Getty Images) (Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cAmericans were never prepared to embrace electric vehicles at the rate predicted by many industry and government 'experts,'\" iSeeCars executive analyst Karl Brauer told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt was obvious getting from 3% to 7% EV share was much easier than getting from 7% to 10%. And getting EV share to 20%, 30%, or more percent? That was clearly a long ways off.\u201d\n\nSaid CarGurus director of industry insights Kevin Roberts: \u201cThe hoped-for EV adoption curve always felt accelerated by an understandable mix of government desire to reduce emissions, along with automakers looking to match Tesla\u2019s margins and stock price success.\u201d He added, \"Decisions were made to attempt to go straight to EVs, and bypass a transitional generation of hybrid powertrains that would\u2019ve allowed for more time to develop consumer comfort in the segment and build up charging infrastructure.\u201d\n\nFor companies like Ford and GM, refocusing on gas-powered and hybrid powertrains seems like a logical move. And the prospect of producing cars that are already cash-flow positive \u2014 and leveraging Chinese partners for EVs \u2014 was sweet music to Wall Street.\n\n\u201cBased on our analysis, the automakers best positioned to capitalize on the growing popularity of hybrids include Asian original equipment manufacturers ... such as Toyota (TM), Honda (HMC), and Hyundai (HYMTF), as well as U.S. automaker Ford,\u201d CFRA\u2019s Garrett Nelson wrote in a research piece in April.\n\n\u201cFord had considerable success with the sale of traditional hybrid versions of two pickup truck models: the Maverick (52,361 units) and the F-150 (50,103 units) in 2023. Also worth mentioning is Stellantis, whose Jeep Wrangler 4xe and Grand Cherokee 4xe were the two bestselling plug-in hybrid models in the U.S. last year,\u201d Nelson added.\n\nConversely, Nelson said automakers who made larger bets on pure battery EVs, such as GM, are less favorably positioned.\n\nTrouble down the road?\n\nThe question remains: Will companies like Ford, GM, Stellantis, and others who have pulled back investments eventually lose EV market share \u2014 and will companies who have kept innovating and spending emerge as the big winners in the eventual EV transformation?\n\nChinese EV makers are going full force into new vehicles with cutting-edge tech and self-driving features. For example, take the success of newer tech brands like Xiaomi and established EV makers like BYD.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese already have every advantage when it comes to EVs, from controlling the global lithium supply to aligning their government and manufacturing sectors to reduce production costs,\u201d iSeeCars\u2019 Brauer added.\n\n\u201c[American automakers] are not ready,\u201d said Stella Li, BYD Americas CEO, about US automakers and their EV game plans in an interview with NBC News in April. \u201cWe are ready. We are ready for technology, and we are more ready on supply chain.\u201d\n\nIn response to the China EV threat, the US and EU announced tariffs against Chinese EV makers, with the US quadrupling levies to 100%, and EU rates going as high as 38.1%. But tariffs and other trade restrictions are not usually a long-term answer, with the failed restrictions on Japanese automakers in the \u201880s a prime example.\n\nPerhaps the old adage, \u201cif you can\u2019t beat them, join them,\u201d might be how automakers like GM, Ford, and Stellantis handle their EV pivots.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Western auto firms (including Tesla) have come to a unanimous and simultaneous realization: China has won the contest for EV supremacy,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas wrote in a note to clients last month. Jonas predicts the industry will enter a new phase of lower spending, higher protectionism through tariffs, and likely cooperation with China with regards to producing and developing EVs.\n\nHowever, tastes in automobiles in the US versus the rest of the world may play in favor of legacy automakers \u2014 the Big Three plus Toyota, VW, and others \u2014 who have been making cars tailored for Americans for some time.\n\nSaid CarGurus' Roberts, \u201cThe US market might prove to be unique enough in its vehicle taste\" like SUVs and pickups, \"while most of the low-cost Chinese EVs tend to be much smaller vehicles, which US consumers tend to shun.\u201d\n\nIn other words, for American automakers, there may be a path to success.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights General Motors, Tesla, ChargePoint, Blink Charging and Lion Electric",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 June 18, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: General Motors GM, Tesla TSLA, ChargePoint CHPT, Blink Charging BLNK and Lion Electric LEV.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nEV Roundup: Tesla's Musk Gets His Big Payday & More\n\nIn an escalating trade dispute, the European Union (EU) imposed up to 38% additional tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). This move is part of the EU's broader strategy to protect its car industry, which supports millions of well-paid jobs and is critical to the region's economic stability.The EU's decision to slap China with higher tariffs follows a much more aggressive move by the United States last month.\n\nOn the news front, U.S. auto biggie General Motors trimmed its forecast for EV production and sales for 2024 amid cooling demand for the same.\n\nMeanwhile, in a show of enduring faith for the EV giant Tesla's visionary CEO, shareholders approved Elon Musk's hefty pay package, currently valued at more than $45 billion (composed of stock options) during the company's annual general meeting. Shareholders also voted in favor of the company's headquarters' shift from Delaware to Texas. In a separate development, Tesla is set to increase Model 3 prices in Europe due to potential higher tariffs by the EU on imported electric cars from China.\n\nEV charging company ChargePoint and Porsche Cars North America have collaborated to integrate CHPT's network into the Porsche Charging Service. CHPT's peer Blink Charging received \"In Process\" FedRAMP status for its EV charging. The manufacturer of zero-emission vehicles, Lion Electric, got the final certification of its LionBattery HD battery pack.\n\nWhile BLNK currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), GM, TSLA, CHPT and LEV carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nLast Week's Top Stories\n\nTesla is set to raise prices for its Model 3 in Europe starting July 1, 2024.Notices regarding the price hike have been posted on Tesla's websites in various European countries. The U.S. automaker has not disclosed the exact increase for the Model 3, which starts at $44,000 in Germany. In another development, shareholders voted in favor of Musk's massive pay package.The saga of Musk's pay package began in 2018 when it was first approved at a staggering $56 billion. However, earlier this year, a Delaware court invalidated it. This led to a fresh shareholder vote, which ultimately reaffirmed support for Musk.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving said that, Musk needs court approval to receive the compensation, and the legal dispute over the compensation plan is far from over. Legal experts predict that the resolution of the lawsuit could take months. But the vote has boosted Tesla's position in ongoing litigation.\n\nGeneral Motors is reducing its expected sales and production of all-electric vehicles for 2024 due to slower-than-anticipated U.S. adoption of EVs. The company now anticipates producing 200,000 to 250,000 all-electric vehicles this year, down from the previous estimate of 200,000 to 300,000. GM expects EVs to comprise 8% of U.S. sales industrywide this year, which is lower than many other auto analyst forecasts of around 10% for 2024.\n\nThe EVs will become profitable on a production basis once they reach 200,000 units, a milestone still expected in the fourth quarter. In May, the company sold more than 9,500 EVs in North America. In the first quarter, EV sales were 16,425 units, representing 2.8% of GM's overall sales.\n\nChargePoint has partnered with Porsche Cars North America (\"PCNA\") to integrate its network into the Porsche Charging Service. This collaboration will expand the number of available charging points for Porsche customers to more than 100,000 across North America. Timo Resch, president and CEO of PCNA, emphasized the partnership's role in broadening charging options and improving customer experience, especially with the upcoming releases of the Taycan and Macan Electric.\n\nThe My Porsche app will facilitate easy access to ChargePoint and partner stations, covering more than 75% of charging ports available to Porsche drivers. The integration is set to go live in the fourth quarter of 2024, aligning with Porsche's adoption of the North American Charging Standard.\n\nBlink has achieved the \"In Process\" designation from the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) for its EV charging solutions. This milestone is crucial as full accreditation will allow government agencies to contract with Blink or its federal resellers for networked EV charging. Blink anticipates achieving full FedRAMP compliance by the end of third-quarter 2024.\n\nFedRAMP ensures secure cloud services for federal agencies, which are committed to deploying 24,000 charging stations by 2035. Blink's CEO, Brendan Jones, emphasized the importance of providing reliable EV charging for government agencies, highlighting the company's readiness to support the federal transition to EVs.\n\nLion Electric has achieved final certification for its LionBattery HD, a heavy-duty lithium-ion battery pack designed for its electric trucks, ensuring compliance with stringent safety standards. These 105 kWh batteries will power the Lion8 Tractor, an all-electric Class 8 commercial truck unveiled at the ACT Expo in Las Vegas.\n\nThis certification follows the previous approval of the LionBattery MD pack for medium-duty trucks and school buses. Lion's facility, with a 1.7 gigawatt-hour annual capacity, can produce batteries for 5,000 vehicles per year. CEO Marc Bedard emphasized the company's commitment to innovation, safety and production efficiency, solidifying Lion Electric's standing in North America's transportation electrification.\n\nWhat's Next in the EV Space?\n\nStay tuned for the announcements of upcoming EV models and any important updates from the red-hot industry.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "3 EV Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "Electric vehicle (EV) companies are in uncharted territory. A few years ago, the market was anticipated to see a bustling demand for this new technology. However, the current reality in this market paints an unsettling picture for some in the industry. Many companies are seeing tepid demand, layoffs and the call to scale back on production. But that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t good picks for EV stocks to buy right now.\n\nCompanies that are surviving or thriving despite this slump are those that have diversified their offerings either alone or by collaboration with other automakers. But in some cases, a few of these companies are somehow powering through the slump and posting great sales.\n\nOther companies\u2019 stocks that can be described as EV-adjacent are better positioned than pure-play EV stocks at the moment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are some of the best EV stocks to buy now.\n\nXpeng (XPEV) The Logo of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng (Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors, also known as XMotors.ai) on tablet. XPEV Stock\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock\n\nWith a market cap of $6.9 billion, Chinese EV maker XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) is a relatively small player in the EV market \u2014 but it is holding its own impressively and might be one of the best EV stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestor reaction was positive after the company turned a profit for Q1 and issued an optimistic guidance for second-quarter car sales. Xpeng\u2019s vehicle margin \u2014 a key profitability metric, jumped over eight percentage points in the first quarter. The company expects to sell at least 25% more units this quarter compared to last year.\n\nAlso, Xpeng is making more money per car and selling more cars overall.\u00a0Its average revenue per vehicle shot to $42,000, thanks to strong sales of the X9 model. This helped push gross margins up to 13% \u2014 a significant improvement from the previous year.\n\nThis success is partly due to its doubled revenue stream from technical services, such as its partnership with Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VLKAF). Xpeng now expects to ship between 29,000 and 32,000 cars this quarter \u2014 which is a year-over-year (YOY) increase of up to 38%.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) An image of the silver logo for GM Global Headquarters being displayed in a building.\n\nSource: ehrlif / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of General Motors (NYSE:GM) are up over 30% this year, which is a rarity if we\u2019re looking at other big players in the U.S. auto market. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford Motors (NYSE:F) and Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) have not seen nearly that level of success.\n\nGeneral Motors posted strong financial results for quarter one of 2024, with a profit of $2.97 billion, exceeding analyst expectations. Revenue also grew by 7.6% YOY \u2014 reaching just over $43 billion and surpassing analyst predictions of $41.15 billion. Earnings per share came in at $2.62, which significantly topped Wall Street estimates of $2.13 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd while other companies, such as Ford, are pivoting to hybrid cars thanks to a cooling in demand for their EVs, GM expects to ramp up production of its all-electric vehicles. The company is on track to produce between 200,000 to 300,000 units this year.\n\nIt also helps that GM shares have an overweight analyst recommendation per MarketWatch, which signals it\u2019s a good bet among EV stocks to buy this June.\n\nOnsemi (ON) a machine manufactures semiconductor chips in a factory setting. AI Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDue to the overall decline in EV stocks in recent years, some investors are looking to dip their toe into the next best thing in the EV space: semiconductors for the auto industry.\n\nOnsemi (NASDAQ:ON) supplies semiconductors and sensors for the automotive industry, and is one such company benefiting from this phenomenon. Shares rose in April after the Scottsdale, Arizona-based EV chips provider posted better-than-expected results for the first quarter.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, ON is profitable. Its price shot by over 50% in the first three quarters of last year, unlike many pure-play EV stocks. Revenue in 2022 jumped 24% to $8.33 billion.\n\nAlso, while the overall stock market took a beating in 2022, ON was relatively unscathed. Its stock value dipped just 9%, compared to the Nasdaq tanking 33% during the same period.\n\nCurrently, analysts are generally bullish on Onsemi, with 18 \u201cbuy\u201d and 13 \u201coverweight\u201d ratings and only one \u201csell\u201d rating.

        "title": "Rags to Riches: 3 EV Stocks That Could Make Early Investors Rich",
        "content": "At one point, electric vehicles were seen as the next world-changing industry. It seemed inevitable that electric vehicle adoption would take over the automotive world. However, while many people have tended to lump together EV developments with the tech sector, it\u2019s important to remember that consumers ultimately drive EV success. Over the past few years, consumer sentiment has been challenged by inflation and EV companies have struggled as a result.\n\nNonetheless, beaten-down sectors like EV currently have long been a target of value investing. Even though EV stocks are being treated as if they are going out of business, in 2023, the total number of EVs on the road hit 40 million worldwide, representing one in every five cars sold. As consumer sentiment restrengthens and inflation gets under control, we\u2019re bound to see a new wave of EV buyers. Here are three EV stocks that are ready to take you from rags to riches!\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere may be no stock that exemplifies rag to riches more than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Over the past five years, shares of TSLA have returned over 1,100% to shareholders. Despite Tesla being one of the most widely covered stocks on Wall Street, analysts are all over the map with price targets. The stock has a one-year price target range of $22.86 to $320.00. Currently, it is trading at just below its average price target of $181.22.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla shareholders recently voted to provide CEO Elon Musk with a record-breaking payday. Musk will now be paid a $56 billion pay package as per the 2018 agreement with the company. What does this mean for the long term? Musk will now be incentivized to help bring Tesla to key milestones including revenue and income goals. In particular, its CyberCab event in August will be the first of many such milestones that shareholders will be looking forward to for renewed optimism and growth confirmation.\n\nAnother thing to note is how cheap Tesla\u2019s stock is right now. Shares are trading at 5.7x forward sales which is well below its five-year average of 9.2x. Putting your money into Elon Musk\u2019s hands has historically been a winning proposition, and for now, Musk looks to be staying on as the head of Tesla for the foreseeable future.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) GM stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a legacy automaker that has long-term aspirations of being an all-electric company. This stock has historically been valued as just an automaker, unlike Tesla which prices in future growth of its AI and robotics segments. Currently, analysts agree that GM is an underpriced stock with a lofty average price target of $54.87 and a street-high price target of $96.00.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, why should you invest in GM for EV exposure? Well, not only does GM have a strong financial standing, but its also making heavy investments into EV technology. In fact, this year, GM expects to produce up to 300,000 electric vehicles! This number should continue to grow and take market share from GM\u2019s internal combustion engine offerings, essentially solidifying itself as a key EV manufacturing player.\n\nDespite its growth in EV production, GM continues to trade at a rock-bottom valuation. Shares of GM are trading at just 0.35x sales and 4.9x forward earnings. Both of these multiples are considerably lower than the five-year average for GM\u2019s stock. Investors looking to find an industry leader at all-time lows, look no further than GM as a future-looking EV leader.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nNot all EV investments are automakers. Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is the world\u2019s largest lithium producer and a key part of the EV battery market. Wall Street analysts agree with how valuable Albemarle is to the industry. In fact, the high end of analyst\u2019s one-year price target\u2019s sit at $216, over 100% higher than its current price.\n\nThis company is the key supplier to EV makers like Tesla and Ford (NYSE:F) as well as countless other traditional non-EV car makers. While Albemarle has seen some pullback due to plunging lithium prices, their recent quarter has demonstrated that their financials are still on track. They even recently announced a 40-cent dividend, thus demonstrating its confidence in using its cash flow to bring shareholder value.\n\nAlbemarle\u2019s stock has been beaten down and has lost about 30% so far this year. This has provided an intriguing entry point for new investors. For example, ALB\u2019s 2.0x forward sales are currently sitting well below its five-year average of 3.9x. If you are bullish on EV stocks bringing you from rags to riches, then Albemarle needs to be at the top of your watchlist!\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors.\n\nAchieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.\n\nWhy Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value Stock\n\nDifferent than growth or momentum investors, value-focused investors are all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under what their true value is before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\nOne of the world\u2019s largest automakers, General Motors held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16.2% in 2023. Headquartered in Detroit, the auto giant has had a long and checkered history. Founded in 1908, the company rose to dominate the U.S. industry. However, hit by the financial crisis, General Motors filed for bankruptcy on Jun 1, 2009. Just within 40 days, the firm emerged from bankruptcy. In 2010, the company launched its IPO \u2013 the biggest in U.S. history at that time \u2013 and has been steadily profitable since then. From going bankrupt in 2009 to becoming one of the world\u2019s best-run car companies, General Motors has indeed come a long way.\n\nGM boasts a Value Style Score of A and VGM Score of A, and holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. Shares of General Motors are trading at a forward earnings multiple of 5X, as well as a PEG Ratio of 0.5, a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 2.4X, and a Price/Sales ratio of 0.3X.\n\nValue investors don't just pay attention to a company's valuation ratios; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. Six analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.34 to $9.44 per share. GM has an average earnings surprise of 17.8%.\n\nWith strong valuation and earnings metrics, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, investors should strongly think about adding GM to their portfolios.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Last week, the China Passenger Car Association released vehicle sales data for May. China's retail sales of passenger vehicles were down 1.9% year over year to 1.7 million units, but 11.4% higher than in April. Retail sales of passenger vehicles in the first five months of 2024 increased 5.7% year over year to 8.07 million units. Sales of new energy vehicles in the country surged 38.5% last month to 804,000 units.\n\nOn the news front, U.S. auto giant General Motors GM provided various updates including a new authorization of stock buyback and investment in Cruise business. One of the leading US auto retailers, Lithia Motors LAD, continued with its buyout binge and forayed into the Memphis market. Japanese auto biggie Honda HMC entered into a JV with Mitsubishi to reduce EV ownership costs and develop power-supply operations for long-term battery use. Italian-American automaker Stellantis STLA held its investor day and reaffirmed its 2024 outlook.\n\nWhile HMC holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), GM and STLA currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. Meanwhile, LAD is Ranked #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nYou can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nLast Week\u2019s Top Stories\n\nGeneral Motors approved a new $6 billion stock repurchase authorization. This follows the $10 billion in accelerated share repurchase program announced in November 2023, which is expected to be completed by the end of this month. In a separate development, the company is investing $850 million into Cruise to cover operational costs after shutting down its robotaxi service following a pedestrian accident. The investment will support Cruise as it resumes autonomous vehicle testing in several U.S. cities. Cruise is also seeking new external investors. In yet another update, GM\u2019s joint venture facility in Ohio struck a tentative local agreement with United Auto Workers.\n\nLithia has expanded its presence in the U.S. Southeast Region by acquiring Sunrise Chevrolet Buick GMC at Collierville and Sunrise Buick GMC at Wolfchase in Memphis, TN, and Woodbridge Hyundai in the greater Toronto area. These new acquisitions are expected to generate more than $240 million in annualized revenues. The prominent Sunrise stores in Tennessee represent LAD's entry into the Memphis market, enhancing its footprint in one of the country's most lucrative regions. The acquisition increases LAD's total expected annualized revenues acquired this year to more than $5.6 billion. The purchases were financed through existing on-balance sheet resources.\n\nHonda and Mitsubishi are set to form a 50/50 joint venture (JV), ALTNA Co., Ltd., in July 2024. The JV is aimed at advancing EV implementation and decarbonization. Combining Honda's EV and battery technologies with Mitsubishi's power-generation expertise, ALTNA will offer mobility services to reduce EV ownership costs and develop power-supply operations for long-term battery use.\u00a0In another development, Honda has partnered with Emporia, a leader in energy management technology, to innovate in-home energy management. This collaboration includes a strategic investment by Honda in Emporia and a joint development agreement in North America focusing on smart EV charging and home energy management.\n\nStory continues\n\nStellantis held its investor day, wherein CEO Carlos Tavares highlighted the company\u2019s unique differentiators that position it strongly amid industry disruptions. STLA\u2019s multi-energy approach spans products, platforms and supply chains, enabling it to adapt to various electrification scenarios. The company reaffirmed its 2024 financial guidance. CFO Natalie Knight emphasized double-digit adjusted operating income margins and positive industrial free cash flows despite short-term headwinds. Stellantis plans to return at least \u20ac7.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in 2024, highlighting its robust capital return strategy.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nThe following table shows the price movement of some of the major auto players over the last week and six-month period.

To ride the vehicle-electrification trend, invest in General Motors stock.\n\nBesides, value-focused investors ought to know that General Motors shares are cheap, cheap, cheap. Believe it or not, General Motors\u2019 GAAP-measured trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is just 5.62x.\n\nIs General Motors serious about the electric vehicle (EV) movement, though? As we\u2019ll discover, the answer is a resounding yes. Even beyond the company\u2019s reasonable valuation, General Motors offers investors prime portfolio access to the latest and greatest in clean-energy vehicles.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEV Production Ramp-Up Coming\n\nNotably, a recent report from Bloomberg identified General Motors as potentially becoming the \u201cbiggest driver of EV growth in the U.S.\u201d for the remainder of 2024. That\u2019s a big statement, but it\u2019s not unjustified.\n\nFor one thing, General Motors is making EVs more affordable with the company\u2019s $35,000 Equinox electric SUV. General Motors is also producing its \u201cSilverado and GMC Sierra electric pickups with up to 450 miles of range,\u201d Bloomberg observed.\n\nHere\u2019s the real kicker, though. General Motors expects to \u201cproduce 200,000 to 300,000 Ultium-based EVs this year,\u201d with Ultium referring to a line of EV batteries.\n\nAmazingly, this could represent a 50x annualized production-rate increase when compared to the 5,800 Cadillac Lyrics that General Motors sold in\u00a02024\u2019s first quarter.\n\nCostco Helps General Motors Sell EVs\n\nHere\u2019s a not-so-trivia piece of trivia that you probably didn\u2019t know. Surprisingly, shoppers can buy a General Motors EV at big-box retail store chain Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST).\n\nI never imagined purchasing an EV along with my groceries, but it\u2019s 2024 and the game has changed for vehicle sellers. Come to think of it, the Costco partnership is a brilliant move for General Motors.\n\nCNBC recently reported that Costco had over 50 million members in the U.S. Plus, General Motors is the \u201cexclusive automotive partner for Costco Auto in Canada.\u201d\n\nThus, offering General Motors\u2019 EVs at Costco locations throughout North America actually makes perfect sense. At the very least, the partnership might expose casual shoppers to clean-energy vehicles.\n\nThis could open the door to faster EV adoption while also spurring sales of General Motors\u2019 electric cars and trucks.\n\nGeneral Motors Stock: The Right EV Pick at the Right Price\n\nGeneral Motors isn\u2019t overvalued at all, and clearly, the company is serious about ramping up its EV production pace. Selling EVs with Costco\u2019s help is a savvy strategy for General Motors.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeneral Motors is a clean-energy vehicle manufacturer that investors can\u2019t afford to ignore. So, whether you\u2019re a value hunter or an EV-industry bull or both, now\u2019s the time to buy General Motors stock\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 7 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "The concept of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy primarily centers on one attribute: industry projections calling for blistering growth over the next several years. To be sure, the sector faces incredible technical (and down the road legal) challenges. However, the spirit of innovation only has one direction \u2013 forward.\n\nInvestors considering the autonomy space can rely on compelling market projections. According to Grand View Research, the global autonomous vehicle market size reached a valuation of $42.37 billion in 2022. Between 2023 and 2030, the sector could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.9%. At the culmination point, the segment may be worth $214.32 billion.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this estimate could be an understatement. Per Fortune Business Insights, the sector could actually expand at a CAGR of 32.3%. Of course, projections represent a nice way of saying opinions. But the point is that autonomy could impact other innovations, such as smart city infrastructure.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith so many downwind relevancies, it\u2019s worth checking this space out. With that, below are the best autonomous driving stocks to buy.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nOne of the biggest semiconductor specialists in the world, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) admittedly lost much of its shine recently. Encumbered with missteps and other misfortunes, INTC has lagged behind the competition. Nevertheless, it could make a comeback with its investments in self-driving solutions. In particular, Intel processors undergird several projects tied to autonomous shuttles and other smart transportation methods.\n\nGranted, INTC stock represents a higher-risk idea, in part due to a lack of analyst support. Right now, the expert consensus on Intel sits as a hold. That\u2019s not exactly encouraging. However, it should be noted that the average price target of $38.02 implies almost 25% upside potential. What\u2019s more, the most optimistic target calls for a price per share of $68. That might get some speculators interested.\n\nLet\u2019s talk financials. Between the second quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, the company\u2019s average earnings per share landed at 30.25 cents. This performance translated to an earnings surprise of 167.28%. Therefore, I would put the skepticism of INTC under a more positive framework. It may very well be one of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother semiconductor powerhouse, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) focuses on the telecommunications sector. As the world moves forward into an increasingly connected ecosystem, Qualcomm should rise above, delivering core relevancies. Regarding autonomous driving, the tech juggernaut collaborates with leading automotive giants to forward self-driving solutions. Plus, its state-of-the-art chips integrate with advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT), making it an ideal choice for mobility.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, the thing about Qualcomm is that while analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy, the average price target sits at only $198. That implies about 9% downside risk. However, it should be noted that the high-side target calls for $245. Also, Qualcomm provides passive income, which shouldn\u2019t be ignored in the tightly competitive tech space.\n\nIn terms of the financials, the company posted an average EPS of around $2.23 in the past four quarters. This performance translated to an average earnings surprise of 7.55%. That\u2019s not necessarily the most resoundingly impressive print out there. However, Qualcomm consistently delivers the goods. As a stable idea, QCOM ranks among the best autonomous driving stocks to buy.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logo\n\nSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdmittedly, General Motors (NYSE:GM) represents a tricky idea when it comes to the best autonomous driving stocks to buy. Late last year, the famous automaker cut about 25% of employees working in its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise. Following an October incident involving one of its autonomous vehicles, California regulators shut down the robotaxi business.\n\nObviously, that\u2019s not a great look for the brand. However, the road to full autonomy will come with significant hurdles. Over the long run, GM has a vision to continue pushing the envelope of what is possible. In the meantime, it\u2019s leveraging its developed acumen to implement advanced driver assistance systems. While not exactly full autonomy, such systems can help save lives.\n\nOnto the financial equation, GM posted an average EPS of $2.01 during the past four quarters. This performance yielded an average earnings surprise of nearly 14%. That\u2019s quite impressive, with the company beating bottom-line targets in each of the quarters between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $56.27 average price target. That implies just over 18%, with the high-side target clocking in at $96. It\u2019s one of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother stalwart in the technology space, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and other innovative solutions. Therefore, it\u2019s no surprise that GOOGL ranks among the best autonomous driving stocks to buy. Specifically, Alphabet offers its business unit Waymo, which bills itself as the world\u2019s first autonomous ride-hailing service.\n\nFrankly, Waymo could be the ultimate disrupter in a fluid dynamic where the hunter becomes the prey. As you know, the global ride-sharing industry caught fire, with the sector projected to hit a double-digit percentage CAGR from now until 2030. Independent contractors (i.e. gig workers) replaced professional taxis. However, autonomous ride-hailing services could disrupt the disruptive gig workers.\n\nI suppose it\u2019s a dog-eat-dog world. Financially, the beauty of Waymo is that parent company Alphabet is a powerhouse. In the past four quarters, the company posted EPS of $1.63. That came out to an average earnings surprise of 10.68%.\n\nAnalysts rate GOOGL a consensus strong buy with a $197.67 price target, implying nearly 13% upside potential. There\u2019s no stopping this beast. It\u2019s one of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nCommonly referred to as the Google of China, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) makes an intriguing case for the best autonomous driving stocks to buy. First, the company re1ported that revenue from its generative AI applications has helped boost the top line. Second, it can apply this acumen to its robotics and self-driving mobility lab. With China commanding the world\u2019s biggest automotive market, Baidu enjoys a massive opportunity.\n\nWhat sweetens the narrative is that BIDU stock is also undervalued. Right now, shares trade at 12.52X trailing-year earnings and 9.27X forward earnings. Both stats are well below their respective industry median metrics. Further, the market prices BIDU at a trailing-year revenue multiple of 1.8X. While not quite as discounted relative to earnings, the sector median lands at 1.93X.\n\nRegarding its earnings performance, Baidu in the past four quarters posted EPS of around $2.96. This translated to an average earnings surprise of 26.33%. That\u2019s impressive considering that the \u201cworst\u201d quarter represented a beat of 22.6%.\n\nAnalysts overall rate BIDU a consensus strong buy with a $151.56 average price target. That implies over 61% upside potential.\n\nAptiv (APTV) An Aptiv (APTV) office building in Poland.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Dublin, Ireland, Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) falls under the auto parts industry. It\u2019s a massive company, featuring 154,000 full-time employees. While it may not be a household name here in the vein of Intel or Google, the reality is that Aptiv ranks among the best autonomous driving stocks to buy. Per its website, the enterprise features partnerships with some leading automakers to develop self-driving capabilities.\n\nAnalysts are intrigued with the idea, rating shares a consensus strong buy. Further, the average price target stands at $107.38, implying over 44% upside potential. What\u2019s more, the high-side target runs up to $145, almost double the value of Thursday\u2019s close. Perhaps most impressive is that the least-optimistic view calls for a price of $83. That still implies growth from Thursday.\n\nThe company continues to impress in the financial department. Between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024, Aptiv beat all four bottom-line targets, with the average EPS landing at nearly $1.28. This performance translated to an average earnings surprise of 12.43%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS to expand over 24% to reach $6.05. Sales may also rise 5.5% to hit $21.15 billion.\n\nAeva Technologies (AEVA) Mobile phone with logo of American autonomous driving company Aeva Inc. on screen in front of business web page. Focus on left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nEasily the riskiest idea on this list of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy, Aeva Technologies (NYSE:AEVA) isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. With a market capitalization of only $147.44 million, AEVA is liable to go anywhere. Right now, that direction seems to be down, with shares slipping more than 26% in the trailing month. Still, the idea is compelling for visionary speculators.\n\nAeva specializes in its proprietary 4D sensory solution. Rather than merely \u201cseeing\u201d objects around the system-integrated vehicle, Aeva\u2019s advanced algorithms calculate the forward trajectory of said objects. In this manner, the tech-integrated vehicle isn\u2019t just avoiding obstacles, which is a reactionary move. Rather, it anticipates where objects may be in space and time. That may lead to much more sensible safety maneuvers.\n\nIn my opinion, the narrative is strong \u2013 there\u2019s no doubt about that. However, the performance has not been up to snuff. In the past four quarters, Aeva posted a negative surprise (can\u2019t really call it \u201cearnings\u201d) of 6.08%.\n\nStill, analysts expect big things from AEVA stock, rating it a moderate buy with a $5.87 price target. We\u2019re talking over 110% upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "content": "Tech Innovation To Solve EV Challenges\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) got the lead on the EV front as a pioneer with Elon Musk\u2019s visionary leadership. But regulatory challenges, competition and an unfavorable macroeconomic environment made the ambitious Tesla focus on making an affordable vehicle while autonomous driving remains work in progress. Tesla aims to build its more cost-effective next-generation EV at its new factory in Mexico.\n\nMeanwhile, an Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) company just revealed its solution to an EV challenge and\u00a0Worksport Ltd. (NASDAQ: WKSP)\u00a0just got recognized as innovator for its contribution to the automotive sector as it\u2019s about to release the Alpha launch of its eagerly anticipated solar-powered accessories for pickups.\n\nIntel To Lower Costs Of EV Making And Boost EV Performance\n\nIntel just presented a new SOC solution that promises to accelerate EV innovation. The groundbreaking OLEA U310 SoC streamlines e-motor technology, lowering EV design and manufacturing costs. With today\u2019s lunch from\u00a0Silicon Mobility, an Intel Company, the new OLEA U310 system-on-chip (SoC)\u00a0promises to enhance\u00a0the efficiency of the existing battery technology through energy savings at the vehicle level. First for the industry, this next generation technology also promises to improve overall EV performance along with streamlining design and production.\n\nBuffalo Business First Awards Worksport As Innovator Of The Year\n\nWorksport just got rewarded as innovator of the year for its\u00a0pioneering\u00a0advancement\u00a0in the automotive sector.\u00a0The Alpha launch of Worksport\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0SOLIS solar-powered truck bed cover and COR portable battery system is expected as early as this summer. SOLIS will be the first-to-market solar-integrated tonneau cover, reflecting Worksport\u2019s innovative edge. Along with the COR, Worksport is bringing a game-changing power duo to the industry, promising off-grid power on the go. Tapping into the multibillion-dollar market,\u00a0the SOLIS cover\u00a0is\u00a0expected to be compatible with Ford\u00a0Motor (NYSE: F)\u00a0F-Series,\u00a0General Motor (NYSE: GM)-owned\u00a0Chevrolet Silverado, and\u00a0Stellantis (NYSE: STLA)\u00a0Ram pickups, providing options for partnership with Tesla as well. On the other hand, the COR will be offered to all consumers, independently of pickups, as anyone will be able to use it, anywhere, to power almost anything. Therefore, Worksport\u2019s pitch goes beyond building a battery that will extend a pickups\u2019 range, easing the EV range anxiety, but it promises to craft outdoor experiences like no other.\n\nStory continues\n\n2024 - A\u00a0Year Of EV Innovation\n\n2023 was the year of the electric pickup, with Tesla\u2019s eagerly anticipated Cybertruck finally hitting the road. In May, GM and Ford showed that, thanks to electric pickups and SUV, they managed to refute the EV slowdown. This year, Worksport promises to\u00a0revolutionize the\u00a0automotive accessory\u00a0market with its integrated solar technology\u00a0for pickups and Intel is set to accelerate EV innovation.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

This strategic investment approach ensures recovery-led gains and positions one\u2019s portfolio to benefit from broader macroeconomic recoveries and sector-specific booms. Hence, here are three discounted stocks to buy now.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs we navigate through a tense political landscape with looming tariffs against China, GeneralMotors (NYSE:GM) is positioned to benefit, given its significant domestic operations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnderpinning GM\u2019s resilience is its strategic management decisions. The company has actively engaged in share buybacks. This move underscores management\u2019s confidence in the company\u2019s financial health and enhances shareholder value. Moreover, the company\u2019s first-quarter results were particularly impressive. GM reported a non-GAAP EPS of $2.62, surpassing Wall Street expectations by a considerable margin.\n\nGM faces potential headwinds from a weaker macroeconomic environment, which could dampen consumer spending and lower auto sales. Yet, GM\u2019s proactive strategies in share repurchases and technological advancements and a solid balance sheet place it in a strong position to navigate challenges. With a forward P/E ratio of 5.6x, considerably lower than the industry average, and a strong earnings outlook, GM stands out as a resilient player in a fluctuating market. It\u2019s a top pick for investors seeking value and growth.\n\nCVS Health (CVS) The logo for CVS Pharmacy is displayed on a retail storefront.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCVS Health (NYSE:CVS) has been a leading player in the healthcare and retail pharmacy landscape. The company is known for its extensive network of CVS pharmacy retail stores, the pharmacy benefits manager CVS Caremark, primary care provider Oak Street Health and health insurance provider Aetna. Despite facing challenges, CVS presents a compelling investment opportunity. This is especially true considering recent market reactions seem to underscore its potential undervaluation.\n\nStory continues\n\nCVS\u2019s stock experienced significant volatility following the first quarter of the 2024 earnings report, reflected mixed financial outcomes and triggered a sharp decline in stock price to about $55 per share. It marked a steep discount from previous levels. The stock is currently trading at a forward P/E of 10.8x, a significant discount from the sector median of 27x.\n\nMoreover, CVS pays a substantial dividend, offering an appealing forward dividend yield of 4.4% that complements the investment case for those seeking income along with price appreciation. The potential for a rebound in stock price, supported by fundamental business strengths and strategic initiatives, makes CVS a promising candidate for investors looking for undervalued opportunities in the healthcare sector.\n\nEOG Resources (EOG)\n\nSource: iStock\n\nEOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) has pioneered advanced drilling techniques that have substantially lowered its breakeven costs. It\u2019s one of the most cost-efficient producers in the shale industry. The company\u2019s focus on premium drilling locations has enabled it to maintain profitability even in fluctuating market conditions.\n\nThe Utica Shale play, primarily located in eastern Ohio, has recently come into focus as a potentially game-changing asset. The company\u2019s aggressive acreage acquisition strategy has positioned it favorably in this play, which promises a rich mix of oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nEOG Resources\u2019 financial discipline is a cornerstone of its industry leadership. The company boasts a strong balance sheet. It\u2019s underscored by a low debt-to-assets ratio and significant liquidity, providing ample flexibility to navigate market cycles. The company\u2019s stock is trading at a discounted valuation, with a forward P/E of 9.95x. This is below the sector\u2019s forward P/E of 11.62x.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohammed Saqib did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Chinese EVs are 'driving into Mexico' \u2014 and it's starting to worry the US",
        "content": "Four years after the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA) was adopted, Mexico and the US face a common concern: the prospect of cheap Chinese electric vehicles dominating a fast-growing market and undermining regional carmakers like GM (GM), Ford (F), and Tesla (TSLA) in the process.\n\nChinese imports have already begun south of the US border. EV and plug-in hybrid imports jumped 443.9%, by value, in the first quarter compared to the same period the previous year, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nOverall, 1 in 10 cars sold in Mexico today comes from a Chinese automaker, according to Reuters, with seven new brands entering the market last year alone.\n\n\u201cAlmost overnight, we started seeing Chinese cars driving in Mexico,\u201d said Juan Carlos Baker, Mexico's former vice minister for foreign trade. \u201cIn terms of how often you see them and how aggressive their marketing and sales campaigns have been on the part of Chinese cars, that is really pretty evident.\u201d Electric taxis are being charged at a charging station in downtown Mexico City, Mexico, at night. (Getty Images) (benedek via Getty Images)\n\nHowever, calls to curb Chinese EV makers in the US and Mexico have intensified recently in response to increased imports and investment. According to Baker, who played a critical role in crafting the USMCA, the threat of cheap Chinese EVs flooding the market never emerged as a concern in the two years the trade pact was being negotiated.\n\n\"I was present in every single meeting, and I don't remember once Ambassador Lighthizer or anyone at [the US Trade Representative office] saying, 'We need to make these rules of origin or other elements very strict because the Chinese are coming,'\" he said.\n\nAlthough Baker noted that no Chinese carmaker has started manufacturing vehicles in Mexico yet, the country's proximity to the US has raised particular alarm in Washington. Lawmakers fear auto companies will use the country as a backdoor to skirt US tariffs on Chinese car imports, which President Joe Biden raised to 100% last month.\n\nBYD has publicly expressed its intention to set up a factory in Mexico; however, its top executive has insisted the company has no plans to enter the US market.\n\nMexico is 'the perfect match'\n\nForeign markets have taken on increased importance for Chinese firms as the domestic market matures and sales in China slow.\n\nThe early success of Chinese auto brands in Latin America offers a glimpse into their expansion strategy to build a presence in countries with a large number of free trade agreements, easy access to resources, and a labor force that offers high-quality production at a lower cost.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cYou have the perfect match,\u201d said Felipe Munoz, an analyst at automotive intelligence firm Jato. \u201c'We\u2019re talking about [a market with sales projected at] 1.2 million units per year. \u2026 This still has growth potential. And so [Mexico] is attractive for any carmaker.\u201d\n\nMexico is following in the path of Latin America\u2019s largest car market, Brazil, where Chinese firms like BYD (BYDDY) and Great Wall Motor (GWLLF) have already set up manufacturing operations.\n\nBrazil \u2014 already the fourth-largest importer of Chinese vehicles \u2014 saw new electric vehicle sales jump 91%, according to data from the Brazilian Association of Electric Vehicles. Chinese automakers BYD, Chery, and Great Wall were three of the top five car brands.\n\nIn Latin America broadly, Chinese EV makers already have 86% market share, according to Jato, in large part due to aggressive price competition.\n\n\u201cThey are applying more or less the same formula in these developing economies in the way that they are becoming the only choice to drive electric because the other ones are very expensive,\u201d said Munoz. \u201cThe regulation and safety standards are not as difficult or complex in those economies.\u201d Chinese EV manufacturer BYD, shown here at the Paris Car Show on Oct. 17, 2022, has made its plans to expand in Mexico and Latin America clear. (AP Photo/Michel Euler, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nRevisiting trade rules\n\nStill, Chinese car manufacturers' push to export and expand abroad has faced resistance, particularly in developed markets where lawmakers are revisiting existing trade rules in order to prevent a flood of cheap vehicle imports.\n\nConcerns in Europe, where Chinese EVs now have roughly 7% market share, according to Jato, prompted an anti-subsidy investigation earlier this year. And on Wednesday, the EU imposed tariffs of up to 38% on Chinese EV imports.\n\nThat came weeks after Biden raised the tariff rate on imports of Chinese EVs from 25% to 100%. The tariff rate on lithium-ion batteries and battery parts also increased from 7.5% to 25%.\n\nDuo Fu, vice president of battery markets for Rystad Energy, said that the tariff announcements have already started to shift carmakers' investment decisions away from the most developed markets.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t think the US is a critical market for the Chinese at the moment,\u201d Fu said. A man walks past a mural depicting Tesla CEO Elon Musk in Santa Catarina, Nuevo Leon state, Mexico on April 29, 2024. (ALFREDO ESTRELLA/AFP via Getty Images) (ALFREDO ESTRELLA via Getty Images)\n\nThe changing dynamics are also prompting a rethink of the USMCA two years ahead of its scheduled review. Though, new leadership in Mexico and a potential return of the Trump administration could complicate the approach to tackling Chinese EVs.\n\nIn the meantime, Baker said Chinese firms are unlikely to find a workaround to be in compliance with stringent automotive rules of origin in the existing trade agreement. The USMCA specifies that automakers have to meet three rules of origin to qualify for preferential treatment under the act: a regional value content requirement for the overall vehicle, a labor value content rule, and thresholds for automobile parts.\n\n\u201cThe Rule of Origin on cars on the USMCA is one of the most difficult things to do industry-wise,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThere is no way that you can import a car from China, even if it's just knocked down and they just put it together and add a couple of things here and there and then send it to us and ... try to pass it as a Mexican car. That's just not possible.\u201d\n\nClick here for the latest economic news and indicators to help inform your investing decisions.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Some believe that the Street always values companies more or less correctly and is never completely wrong about companies\u2019 outlooks. But history shows this concept is completely incorrect. In the last few years, the Street massively underestimated the value of two stocks that large investors completely overlooked: Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) and American Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC).\n\nSuper Micro specializes in making servers used to facilitate artificial (AI). It was a little-known company that was changing hands for around $55 in October 2022. Today, after the stock\u2019s massive gains in the wake of the AI boom, SMCI stock is worth around $775 per share. The trend was largely unforeseen by the Street until the end 2022.\n\nSimilarly, large investors were completely unenthused about American Superconductor until recently. The company develops systems that facilitate the smooth flow of electricity, along with components of wind turbines and Navy ships. As recently as October 2023, shares changed hands for a paltry $6.50. However, the firm\u2019s recent strong fiscal fourth-quarter results finally made the Street realize the company was benefiting from multiple, strong positive catalysts. AMSC stock is now worth about $23.50.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three overlooked small-cap stocks that can similarly become beloved by the Street.\n\nRedwire (RDW) A concept art of an astronaut with a space secene behind. Space Stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRedwire (NYSE:RDW) provides products and infrastructure that facilitates space travel. The company appears to be benefiting from the relatively recent, renewed emphasis by America and other countries on space travel.\n\nRedwire provided the cameras that were used byIntuitive Machines\u2019 (NASDAQ:LUNR) lunar lander that successfully touched down on the Moon in February. It also provided \u201cdeployment mechanisms and 100-foot booms\u201d for NASA\u2019s Solar Sail system. As a result, it appears the company is well-positioned to benefit from NASA\u2019s revitalization.\n\nSimilarly, Redwire recently disclosed the European Space Agency\u00a0chose it to provide a robotic arm prototype for the agency\u2019s lunar lander. So it seems the company will benefit from the EU\u2019s future space missions. Finally, the company is developing \u201c18 ship sets of antennas and radio frequency hardware\u201d for Rocket LabUSA (NASDAQ:RKLB), which is developing satellites for the U.S. Space Force.\n\nIn the first quarter, Redwire\u2019s revenue of $87.8 million climbed 52% compared to the same period a year earlier. Its net cash provided by operating activities also rose by $16.8 million year-over-year to $2.8 million. Last, Redwire\u2019s pipeline rose to a very impressive $6.8 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven Redwire\u2019s strong positive catalysts and its impressive financial performance, it is one of the best small-cap stocks to buy.\n\nMayville Engineering (MEC) The fiber laser cutting machine cutting the sheet metal plate with the sparking light.Hi-technology manufacturing concept.\n\nSource: Pixel B / Shutterstock.com\n\nMayville Engineering (NYSE:MEC) provides products for manufacturers. Among the functions carried out by its offerings are \u201cproduction, design, prototyping, tooling (and) fabrication.\u201d\n\nThe company is likely benefiting from multiple, strong trends including the onshoring of manufacturing, the rising production of electric vehicle batteries and solar panels and the increased production of semiconductors.\n\nMayville\u2019s revenue rose 9% last year to $588.4 million. Management said it is getting a lift from increased orders from military contractors and commercial vehicle makers.\n\nIn Q1, the company\u2019s year-over-year sales growth accelerated to an impressive 13% while adjusted EBITDA advanced 34% to $18.5 million versus the same period a year earlier. The annual run rate of adjusted EBITDA is $74 million. With Mayville\u2019s current market capitalization of $343 million, the shares are changing hands at a very low price-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.6 times.\n\nEVgo (EVGO) EVgo fast charging station\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nEV charging company EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) has a very close partnership with General Motors (NYSE:GM). Not only can GM\u2019s EVs be easily charged at EVgo\u2019s facilities but the automaker often provides its buyers with free charging services through EVgo. And GM is helping to finance the construction of 2,000 EVgo chargers nationwide.\n\nTherefore, the fact that GM sold a record total of more than 9,000 EVs last month is certainly great news for EVgo and EVGO stock. In addition to the high likelihood that many of the owners of these new EVs will likely use EVgo\u2019s chargers on their road trips, GM\u2019s performance shows the inaccuracy of predictions of the demise of the EV sector in general and GM\u2019s EV business in particular. Once the Street internalizes the fact that EVs have a bright future in America, EVGO stock should rally tremendously.\n\nIn Q1, EVgo\u2019s top line more than doubled YOY to $55.2 million, and the company expects to break even on an EBITDA basis in 2025.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in EVGO, AMSC, and SMCI. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

As the world becomes greener due to shifting consumer preferences or government legislation, EVs will become more popular and important in the car industry. Now, around 20% of cars sold in the U.S. are EVs. EVs were valued at $50 billion in 2022 and are expected to grow at a compounding annual growth rate of 15.5% from 2023 to 2032.\u00a0Here are three top EV stocks.\n\nRivian (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeader in the EV space, Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), is one of the largest American EV companies and has the potential to be one of the biggest EV companies in the world. Now, it\u2019s trading at a discount, making it an even more attractive buy. The focus is on expanding their products and working on the highly anticipated R2 model. Rivian is also building a $5 billion production facility in Georgia. Increasing productive capacities to be fierce rivals with other EV companies represents the company\u2019s growth efforts.\n\nRivian also has a great financial standing. First, its cash reserve is massive. With over $10 billion in cash, Rivian is relatively safe from bankruptcy while having the resources and time to reach economies of scale, lower costs and potentially become profitable. Its revenue has grown over 100% in just the past year. It is not due to pay most of the $4 billion in debt now. Thus, it is less affected by the high interest rates and has a higher chance of survival.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store.

It plans to invest more than 6 billion yuan to build 5000 charging stations, opening a new revenue line. They are also constantly creating new models, most recently launching the Li L6.\n\nLi Auto\u2019s financials support the buy thesis. Despite the last quarter not being ideal, its overall growth has been tremendous. Year over Year, from the second quarter of 2023, it showed 270% growth on the top line, corresponding to an impressive $34.7B in revenue. The company is also consistently profitable, which minimizes risk of bankruptcy and supports the company\u2019s expansion.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Cadillac car and SUV dealership.

The company sold a staggering 6.2 million cars in 2023, which meant nearly $140 billion in revenue. Even though car manufacturing costs are high, the company still has a margin of about 7%, giving it a large amount of funds to invest in R&D for its EV segment. Additionally, the company has a cash pile of over $25 billion, providing it with safety and flexibility.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tomas Levani did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "GM To Reach EV Profitability By Year-End Despite Making Less EVs",
        "content": "GM To Reach EV Profitability By Year-End Despite Making Less EVs\n\nWith the EV adoption in the U.S. being slower than anticipated, General Motors (NYSE: GM) revised this year\u2019s expected EV sales and production, while being\u00a0launching its newest EVs, including its new entry-level Chevrolet Equinox EV. Along with the recent relaunch of Chevrolet Blazer EV after software issues got sorted out, these two EVs, both built on GM\u2019s Ultium EV platform, are crucial for the Detroit automaker\u2019s EV growth.\n\nEV Demand Is Growing, But Slower Than Expected\n\nPreviously targeting production between 200,000 and 300,000, Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson stated the revised target for the full year is between 200,000 to 250,000 EVs. Some time ago, GM once expected to make as many as 400,000 EVs by mid 2024. However, GM is expecting its EV segment to become profitable\u00a0on a production, or contribution-margin basis once it makes 200,000 EVs, therefore, it expects to reach this milestone in the fourth quarter. On June 4th,\u00a0GM CEO Mary Barra clearly stated that GM remains committed to EVs, despite the mass industry slowdown, with May being the automaker\u2019s best EV sales month ever in North America. Even better days seem to be ahead as at the end of May, as its EV lineup got bigger with the mass-market Chevrolet Equinox EV priced at $35,000. Barra also added that ultimately, the pace of GM\u2019s EV development will be guided by customer demand.\n\nMeanwhile, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) reported that its new vehicle sales surged 88%\u00a0during the first five months of 2024, fueled by both EVs and hybrids that both grew about 65%. While the EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) continues to struggle with its aging lineup, GM and Ford are improving their positioning on the EV front. Their Detroit peer, Stellantis (NYSE: STLA) is pursuing its EV goals despite a challenging macroeconomy and the EV slowdown. Back in March, Stellantis warned that a turbulent year ahead, much like Tesla CEO, Elon Musk. But, at the end of May, Stellantis CEO teased about\u00a0a\u00a0$25,000 all-electric Jeep EV coming to the U.S. very soon. Also in late May, Stellantis boss made sure to emphasize that Stellantis is not in a race to transition to EVs, but rather in a race to lower EV costs. On Thursday, Stellantis will have its Investor Day, where its leadership is expected to lay out the automaker\u2019s strategy, along with addressing the Chinese competition, its ambitious targets and forthcoming products, and possibly more cost-reductions.\n\nAlthough the EV slowdown is slowing down an EV titan like Tesla, it\u2019s turning out to be the best time for traditional automakers like GM and Ford who were struggling the keep up with the EV hype. Tesla kicked off 2024 with its first YoY sales drop in four years, suggesting it is in its flop era, while Ford began the year on a strong note and GM remained on track despite the discontinuation of the Chevy Bolt that weighted on EV sales. The first half of the year has almost passed and unlike Tesla, Ford and GM can tout their EV progress amid a gloomy and challenging macroenvironment.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "General Motors (GM) Hits 52-Week High on a Few Business Updates",
        "content": "General Motors GM hit a 52-week high of $49.35 yesterday to close the session at $48.86. The upswing was driven by a series of business updates. It approved a new $6 billion stock repurchase authorization. This follows the accelerated $10 billion share repurchase program announced in November 2023, which is expected to be completed by the end of this month.\r\n\r\nPer Paul Jacobson, CFO of GM, the company is focused on the profitability of the internal combustion engine business, growth and improvement of the EV business profitability, and efficient capital deployment, which allows continued returns of cash to shareholders.\r\n\r\nThe new authorization will enable GM to repurchase shares opportunistically after completing the current reauthorization, although no timeframe was announced.\r\n\r\nThe buyback plans are announced amid uncertainty about the adoption of all-electric vehicles and stalling customer demand for new vehicles.\r\n\r\nPer Jacobson, GM's investments in its brands and product portfolio, along with operational discipline, are delivering consistently strong revenue growth, margins and free cash flow.\r\n\r\nGeneral Motors provided a few more updates at the recently held Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry Conference.\n\nGM Trims 2024 Sales and Production Guidance for All-Electric Vehicles\n\nThe legendary automaker is reducing its expected sales and production of all-electric vehicles for 2024 due to slower-than-anticipated U.S. adoption of EVs.\r\n\r\nPer Jacobson, the company now anticipates producing 200,000 to 250,000 all-electric vehicles this year, down from the previous estimate of 200,000 to 300,000. This adjustment aligns production with the slower-growing demand. The lower end of the revised range reflects the company\u2019s business momentum.\r\n\r\nGM expects EVs to comprise 8% of U.S. sales industrywide this year, which is lower than many other auto analyst forecasts of around 10% for 2024.\r\n\r\nThe EVs will become profitable on a production basis once they reach 200,000 units, a milestone still expected in the fourth quarter. In May, the company sold more than 9,500 EVs in North America. In the first quarter, EV sales were 16,425 units, representing 2.8% of GM's overall sales.\n\nGM Invests $850M in Cruise to Cover Operational Costs\n\nGeneral Motors is investing $850 million into Cruise to cover operational costs after shutting down its robotaxi service following a pedestrian accident.\r\n\r\nPer Jacobson, the investment will support Cruise as it resumes autonomous vehicle testing in several U.S. cities. Cruise is also seeking new external investors.\r\n\r\nCruise had been a significant financial loss for GM even before the incident last year when a driverless vehicle dragged a pedestrian in San Francisco. Since 2017, GM has lost $8.2 billion on Cruise, including $3.48 billion in 2023. Cruise agreed to a settlement of at least $8 million with the injured woman.\r\n\r\nIn response to the incident, Cruise grounded its vehicles, conducted a safety review and hired law firms to examine its protocols. Last year, the company issued a recall of all 950 Cruise vehicles to update vehicle software. Several top executives resigned and a quarter of the staff was laid off. General Motors\u2019 executives, including Craig Glidden and Mo Elshenawy, stepped in, with Jon McNeill named as vice chair of the Cruise board alongside GM CEO Mary Barra.\r\n\r\nDespite previously reducing spending on Cruise, GM remains committed to the company, hoping for a future return on its investment. Cruise has slowly redeployed cars, starting with human-driven vehicles in Houston, and plans to transition to supervised autonomous driving. It also operates vehicles in Phoenix and Dallas.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nGM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the auto space are Blue Bird Corporation BLBD, Oshkosh Corporation OSK and American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc.

        "title": "The 3 Best Under $50 Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Stocks needn\u2019t be expensive to buy. In fact, stocks often attract more investors when their share price is affordable. Companies appear to acknowledge this fact, which is why many are splitting their stocks. Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) just split its stock on a 10-for-1 basis, taking the share price down to $120 from $1,200. Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) will split its stock later in June on a 50-for-1 basis.\n\nRight now, many stocks are trading for less than $50, putting them in reach of most investors. A lot of these stocks are of well-known blue-chip companies and are trading at fair valuations, with many of them also offering attractive dividends. Best of all, some of these affordable stocks have catalysts pushing their share prices higher. Here are the three best under $50 stocks to buy in June 2024.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of automotive giant General Motors (NYSE:GM) is currently trading just under $48 per share. The price might not be below $50 for long after the company announced a new $6 billion stock buyback program. The share repurchase comes as a $10 billion stock buyback program announced in November 2023 ends on June 30. A timeframe for completing the new share repurchases hasn\u2019t been announced.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Detroit automaker\u2019s commitment to its shareholders is admirable, especially coming after the company endured a costly strike last fall when employees represented by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union staged rotating strikes that temporarily shut down production. General Motors is also grappling with uncertainty surrounding consumer demand for electric vehicles, which the automaker has invested billions of dollars in.\n\nDespite the headaches, General Motors has managed to post strong financial results in recent quarters, putting it in a position to extend its stock buyback program. GM stock has increased 31% in the last 12 months.\n\nUBS Group (UBS) UBS (UBS) bank sign on gray stone wall with red and gray logo\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Judith Linine\n\nShares of Swiss banking giant UBS Group (NYSE:UBS) have risen 54% in the last 12 months but still trade for a little more than $30 per share. UBS stock currently looks cheap to buy, trading at only three times price/earnings. Now might be an opportune time to buy UBS stock, with the bank scheduled to complete its merger with former rival Credit Suisse by July 1 of this year.\n\nUBS, which acquired Credit Suisse in 2023 for $3.2 billion after the bank\u2019s collapse, had previously said the banks\u2019 combination would be completed by year\u2019s end. The accelerated takeover of Credit Suisse leaves Switzerland with one global bank that has a balance sheet twice as large as the country\u2019s economy. Going forward, UBS will be an international behemoth with nearly $6 trillion of assets under management.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to being cheap, UBS stock also pays a quarterly dividend of 17.5 cents per share, giving it a yield of over 2%.\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV) a southwest airline stocks (LUV) jet flying above the clouds\n\nSource: Carlos E. Santa Maria / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) have gotten beaten down since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. LUV stock today is trading 42% lower than where it was five years ago. At under $30 per share, the stock should be accessible to most investors. And now might be a good time to take a position with major changes coming to the airline. Southwest stock recently jumped 8% higher on news that activist investor Elliott Investment Management has built a $1.9 billion stake in the carrier.\n\nPrivately held Elliott has become one of Southwest Airlines\u2019 largest shareholders and is demanding big changes at the underperforming company, including the ousting of CEO Robert Jordan and an overhaul of the board. Elliott Management says major changes are needed to reverse the prolonged slump in LUV stock. Investors appear to agree. With air travel in the U.S. back at record levels, many investors say it is unacceptable that Southwest\u2019s stock continues to underperform.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "The Vita Coco and Xerox have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013June 12, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares The Vita Coco Company COCO, as the Bull of the Day and Xerox Holdings XRX, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on General Motors GM, Ford\u2019s F and Tesla\u2019s TSLA.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nThe Vita Coco Company, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is a leading producer of coconut water. The company develops, markets, and distributes coconut water products under the Vita Coco brand in Canada, Europe, the Middle East, the Asia Pacific region, as well as the United States.\n\nCoconut water has been all the rage over the past several years, but the fact is this nutritious beverage has been around for centuries. Coconut water is a clear liquid found inside young coconuts that is packed with flavor and electrolytes.\n\nNaturally loaded with potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus, you may have noticed some coconut water appears with a pink hue, which is due to higher levels of polyphenols and exposure to sunlight over time.\n\nVita Coco is part of the Zacks Beverages \u2013 Soft Drinks industry group, which currently ranks in the top 28% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.\n\nStocks within this industry group are also expected to experience above-average earnings growth. Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock\u2019s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.\n\nCompany Description\n\nVita Coco has managed to maintain a substantial market share, commanding over half of the coconut water market in the United States. In addition to coconut water, Vita Coco offers coconut oil and coconut milk; sparkling and purified water; plant-based energy drinks; protein-infused fitness drinks; and a hydration drink mix in powdered form. Vita Coco distributes its products through club, food, retail, drug, mass convenience, e-commerce, and foodservice channels.\n\nThe global coconut water market is projected to be worth nearly $12 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 15.3% over the next several years. As a consumer shift to healthier products continues, the company is well-positioned to take advantage of this theme.\n\nStory continues\n\nVita Coco has also secured partnerships with major beverage companies. For example, the company\u2019s partnership with Diageo led to the launch of Vita Coco Spiked with Captain Morgan, which serves as a prime example of its intent to broaden market reach.\n\nEarnings Trends and Future Estimates\n\nThe producer of coconut water has established an impressive earnings history since its IPO in 2021. The company exceeded earnings estimates in each of the last six quarters. Back in May, Vita Coco posted first-quarter earnings of $0.24/share, a 26.3% surprise over the $0.19/share Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nVita Coco has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 25.3%. Consistently beating earnings estimates is a recipe for success.\n\nAnalysts covering COCO are in agreement and have been raising their earnings estimates lately. For the current fiscal year, analysts increased earnings estimates by 9.47% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $1.04/share, reflecting potential growth of 40.5% relative to the prior year.\n\nLet\u2019s Get Technical\n\nCOCO shares have surged nearly 40% over the past four months. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio \u2013 one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe stock has also been making a series of higher highs. With both strong fundamental and technical indicators, Vita Coco is poised to continue its outperformance.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Vita Coco has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and COCO continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year.\n\nBottom Line\n\nVita Coco is ranked favorably by our Zacks Style Scores, with a best-in-class \u2018A\u2019 rating in our Growth category and a \u2018B\u2019 rating in our Momentum category. This indicates that COCO stock is likely to continue its strong momentum based on a favorable combination of earnings and sales growth.\n\nBacked by a leading industry group and impressive history of earnings beats, it\u2019s not difficult to see why COCO stock is a compelling investment. An appealing technical trend along with robust fundamentals paint a bullish picture moving forward.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nXerox Holdings, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), operates as a global workplace technology company that integrates hardware, services, and software for enterprises. Xerox designs, develops, and sells document systems, IT software products, and print solutions.\n\nThe company also provides graphic communications, end user computing devices, network infrastructure, commercial robotic process automation, as well as technology product support. Xerox sells its products through its direct sales force, distributors, independent agents, dealers, and e-commerce marketplaces.\n\nXerox continues to grapple with decreased demand for paper-related systems and products due to technological advancements. The presence of a large number of substitutes raises competitive pressure. A vulnerability to security breaches along with an inability to protect intellectual property rights represent major concerns.\n\nThe Zacks Rundown\n\nXerox Holdings has been severely underperforming the market over the past year. Shares represent a compelling short or hedge opportunity, even as the major indices eclipse former all-time highs.\n\nXRX stock is part of the Zacks Office Supplies industry group, which currently ranks in the bottom 8% out of approximately 250 industries. Because this industry is ranked in the bottom half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect it to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. This industry has widely underperformed the market so far in 2024.\n\nWhile individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in weak industry groups, their industry association serves as a headwind for any potential rallies. Xerox continues to fight an uphill battle and the stock is confirming this notion, lagging the general market by a wide margin.\n\nRecent Earnings and Deteriorating Forecasts\n\nThe print solutions company has missed the earnings mark in two of the past three quarters. Back in April, Xerox posted first-quarter earnings of $0.06/share, missing the $0.38/share consensus estimate by a whopping 84.2%.\n\nXerox has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings miss of 7.8%. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance.\n\nAnalysts covering XRX decreased their earnings estimates recently. Looking at the current fiscal year, earnings estimates have been slashed by 7.93% in the past 60 days; the Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $2.09/share. Revenues are projected to decline 6.2% year-over-year to $6.46 billion.\n\nCompanies like Canon, Hewlett-Packard, and Toshiba are capable of giving tough competition to Xerox. These companies are also broadening their product lines and strengthening their global presence, putting a dent in potential growth prospects for Xerox.\n\nTechnical Outlook\n\nXerox\u2019s stock has been steadily falling this year after forming a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern and has now established a well-defined downtrend.\n\nXRX stock has also experienced the dreaded death cross, whereby its 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. Xerox Holdings would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. Shares remain in negative territory this year while the general market has eclipsed its former highs.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that we\u2019re not likely to see this stock print new highs anytime soon. The fact that Xerox is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns.\n\nA history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock\u2019s downtrend. Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of XRX stock until the situation shows major signs of improvement.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nTime to Ride GM Stock for Higher Highs?\n\nGeneral Motors stock printed another day of fresh 52-week highs after the auto giant announced an additional $6 billion in stock buybacks. Continuing to appease investors, this comes as General Motors launched a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program at the end of last year and increased its dividend by 33% going into 2024.\n\nThis is certainly a nod to the confidence General Motors has in its business operations and the ability to generate cash flow but let\u2019s see if it's time to buy GM for more upside.\n\nRecent Performance Overview\n\nEdging towards $50 a share, General Motors' stock has climbed +34% year to date which has largely outperformed Ford\u2019s virtually flat performance and Tesla\u2019s -32% while also topping the broader indexes with the S&P 500 up +6% for the year and the Nasdaq sitting on +15% gains.\n\nNotably, concerns of slower EV sales have been the knock on Tesla\u2019s stock while in contrast GM has thrived on delivering stronger profits thanks to its diverse lineup of EVs and traditional gasoline vehicles. General Motors has also attributed its recent success to its operating discipline with the company\u2019s free cash flow ballooning to almost $30 billion and setting the stage for the recent stock buybacks and dividend hike.\n\nEPS Outlook & P/E Valuation\n\nSpeaking to General Motors' increased profitability, its bottom line expansion is expected to continue with fiscal 2024 earnings now projected to jump 22% to $9.40 per share compared to $7.68 a share last year. Plus, FY25 EPS is projected to rise another 1%.\n\nMore intriguing is that GM still trades at just 5X forward earnings which is even beneath Ford\u2019s 6.2X and the industry average of 12.8X while being well below the S&P 500\u2019s 21.7X and Tesla\u2019s 70.4X.\n\nReinstated Dividend\n\nAfter reinstating its dividend in 2022 following a suspension during the pandemic, General Motors increased its payout from 3 cents per quarter to 12 cents at the beginning of the year.\n\nAlthough General Motors' annual dividend yield of 1.01% is still well below Ford\u2019s 4.85% it has crept closer to the S&P 500\u2019s 1.38% average with it being noteworthy that many auto stocks (including Tesla) don\u2019t offer a payout to shareholders as they are focused on growth.\n\nTakeaway\n\nAfter such an extensive YTD rally, General Motors stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). To that point, there could be better buying opportunities ahead but longer-term investors should continue to be rewarded from current levels considering General Motors' increased profitability and cheap P/E valuation.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "title": "The 3 Best Sustainable Energy Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "After a slump throughout 2022 and 2023 \u2014 largely due to tighter monetary policy \u2014 sustainable energy stocks may soon surge again. In-development and installed renewables grew by about 10% to 3,609 gigawatts in 2023 and might serve as a leading indicator that the wider sector is set to boom.\n\nBut which sustainable energy stocks are best to bet on, considering what we know about the sector\u2019s performance? Household solar is a losing proposition for most investors, as the sustainable energy segment\u2019s competition is steep and margins are thin (before getting into ongoing sourcing concerns). Electric vehicle charging stocks face the same problem, and EVs themselves are better valued as either car companies like General Motors (NYSE:GM) or a manufacturer-meets-tech powerhouse like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rather than pure-play sustainable energy stocks.\n\nThese three sustainable energy stocks pivot around those pitfalls, with two offering unique (but risky) access to long-term sustainable energy trends, while the third is a stable giant offering private equity-like gains to anchor your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNano Nuclear Energy (NNE) clean energy stocks: a nuclear power plant in Belgium\n\nSource: engel.ac / Shutterstock\n\nNuclear energy is slowly and quietly undergoing a resurgence, and few sustainable energy stocks are as well-positioned to capture the imminent upside as Nano Nuclear Energy (NASDAQ:NNE).\n\nAt the end of May, the Biden-Harris administration announced a new series of initiatives to boost America\u2019s domestic nuclear energy industry. The initial report points to the fact that nuclear power is (somewhat surprisingly) the nation\u2019s largest clean energy producer, producing nearly 20% of last year\u2019s total national energy. While there are few details about what the administration plans to do moving forward, they formed a Nuclear Power Project Management and Delivery working group to assess, create recommendations, and operationalize new nuclear initiatives.\n\nTo that end, Nano Nuclear Energy is unique among nuclear energy stocks \u2014 let alone sustainable energy stocks \u2014 as the company develops micro-sized, portable reactors to modulate and disperse nuclear energy opportunities more easily. The company\u2019s stock hit public markets in mid-May; since then, shares have surged 33%. Though management doesn\u2019t project full-scale systems deployment until 2030, Nano Nuclear could benefit big-time from the increased focus on nuclear energy as an alternative to other sustainable energy stocks.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) A phone displaying the logo for Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC)\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you want to capture a wide-ranging slice of the renewable energy sector \u2014 and private equity-like gains to boot \u2014 few sustainable energy stocks can top Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP). Brookfield Renewable is a management fund that owns a range of global sustainable energy companies across a diverse portfolio that includes wind, solar, and hydroelectric offerings.\n\nBrookfield marked a major win last month after the sustainable energy stock entered a \u201cfirst o -its kind global framework agreement\u201d with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to help the tech giant reach its net-zero goals by 2030. This agreement includes \u201c100% of its electricity consumption, 100% of the time, matched by zero-carbon energy purchases.\u201d\n\nBrookfield\u2019s financials are also robust and notable among the best sustainable energy stocks, considering the wider sector\u2019s struggles post-ZIRP. The company\u2019s first-quarter report included a 7.6% jump in funds from operations and a dividend distribution aligned with the company\u2019s goal to offer \u201ca sustainable distribution with increases targeted on average at 5% to 9% annually.\u201d Brookfield Renewable\u2019s current dividend yield sits at a respectable 5.1%, which, again, makes it a unique income-producing player compared to most sustainable energy stocks.\n\nStem (STEM) Businessman using ai technology for make money. chat bot with AI Artificial Intelligence generate. Futuristic technology, robot in online system. Business in future to invest and make money concept. AI stocks to buy\n\nSource: MMD Creative / Shutterstock.com\n\nSustainable energy stock Stem (NYSE:STEM) blends two unique \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 sectors: sustainable energy solutions and artificial intelligence. Stem\u2019s Athena software acts as an intermediary or control system between generators, grid power, distributed resources like solar farms, and battery energy storage to best direct resources while accounting for weather, energy pricing and more. That\u2019s all built upon an artificial intelligence backbone that, at the end of the day, creates a self-managing series of sustainable energy solutions for a range of large-scale enterprise customers.\n\nThough trading firmly within penny stock territory, Stem\u2019s leadership has 10X ambitions. The company\u2019s AI and the Future of Energywhite paper points to a well-thought-out strategic plan about how AI integration will accelerate and create efficiencies across sustainable energy markets.\n\nLike so many speculative renewable energy stocks, Stem\u2019s major sticking point is its current lack of profitability. Likewise, the company\u2019s cyclical sales nature adds a bit more variability than most would like. Still, the company is beyond its pre-revenue phase and has a growing portfolio of completed projects. While definitely a long-term, buy-and-hold sustainable energy stock like Nano Nuclear, adding Stem to your portfolio of sustainable energy stocks is a good way to capture emerging AI influence on the sector as it shows its strength within existing green physical infrastructure.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "GM announces a new $6 billion share buyback, now expects to produce as many as 250K EVs this year",
        "content": "GM (GM) shares jumped on Tuesday, as the automaker doubled down on returning capital back to shareholders.\n\nGM announced that its board approved a new share buyback plan to repurchase up to $6 billion of GM\u2019s outstanding common shares. This is an addition to the $10 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program it introduced at the end of last year, which also coincided with its plan to increase its dividend by 33%, which began last January.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to lean into our capital allocation policy, and as the business has continued to perform and we've seen stable pricing, we've seen disciplined incentives from our team, and we've seen a vehicle portfolio that customers just love, and all that spells a lot of success,\u201d GM CFO Paul Jacobson told Yahoo Finance from the Deutsche Bank Global Autos Conference in New York City.\n\nJacobson said the new share buybacks will begin in the second half of 2024.\n\nGM stock rallied after the opening bell by nearly 2% to its highest level in over two years.\n\nPart of GM\u2019s capital allocation strategy is determining the investments the company will make, and is making, in its EV business. Though GM has backed away from its initial big EV plans, Jacobson GM is still bullish on EVs, and has had success with its EV rollout, which came later than rivals like Ford.\n\nJacobson said GM expects to produce 200,000 to 250,000 EVs this year, slightly lower than the 200,000 to 300,000 it had previously expected. But he expects the EVs to be \u201cvariable profit positive\u201d \u2014 meaning GM can \u201csell it for more than the cost of the materials and start to offset all of our fixed costs.\u201d He said, added that GM can reach variable profit in its entire EV fleet by the end of this year, with EBIT (earnings before interest expense and taxes) profitability coming in 2025.\n\nThe EV business in the here and now is starting to turn for GM, too.\n\n\u201cWe're picking up significant [EV market] share, we sold over 9,500 EVs in North America last month,\u201d Jacobson said. The Chevrolet Blazer and Cadillac LYRIQ EV had \u201creally strong gains,\u201d Jacobson said, and he expects that momentum to continue with the entry level Equinox EV, which he noted was the least expensive 300-mile range EV in the market.\n\nJacobson added GM's EV growth rate was actually \"outpacing everybody.\"\n\nIn terms of the GM\u2019s broader 2024 financial metrics, Jacobson said at the conference that GM was keeping its full-year adjusted EBIT forecast of $12.5 billion to $14.5 billion (which it boosted following Q1 results). But he noted that Q2 earnings will be higher than Q1\u2019s adjusted EBIT of $3.9 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a slight down note, GM is investing an additional $850 million into its troubled Cruise autonomous unit, which is getting its robo-taxis back on the road following a high profile accident in San Francisco and missteps that led to a Cruise management shakeup,\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Time to Ride General Motors (GM) Stock for Higher Highs?",
        "content": "General Motors GM stock printed another day of fresh 52-week highs after the auto giant announced an additional $6 billion in stock buybacks. Continuing to appease investors, this comes as General Motors launched a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program at the end of last year and increased its dividend by 33% going into 2024.\n\nThis is certainly a nod to the confidence General Motors has in its business operations and the ability to generate cash flow but let\u2019s see if it's time to buy GM for more upside.\n\nRecent Performance Overview\n\nEdging towards $50 a share, General Motors' stock has climbed +34% year to date which has largely outperformed Ford\u2019s F virtually flat performance and Tesla\u2019s TSLA -32% while also topping the broader indexes with the S&P 500 up +6% for the year and the Nasdaq sitting on +15% gains. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNotably, concerns of slower EV sales have been the knock on Tesla\u2019s stock while in contrast GM has thrived on delivering stronger profits thanks to its diverse lineup of EVs and traditional gasoline vehicles. General Motors has also attributed its recent success to its operating discipline with the company\u2019s free cash flow ballooning to almost $30 billion and setting the stage for the recent stock buybacks and dividend hike. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEPS Outlook & P/E Valuation\n\nSpeaking to General Motors' increased profitability, its bottom line expansion is expected to continue with fiscal 2024 earnings now projected to jump 22% to $9.40 per share compared to $7.68 a share last year. Plus, FY25 EPS is projected to rise another 1%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMore intriguing is that GM still trades at just 5X forward earnings which is even beneath Ford\u2019s 6.2X and the industry average of 12.8X while being well below the S&P 500\u2019s 21.7X and Tesla\u2019s 70.4X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nReinstated Dividend\n\nAfter reinstating its dividend in 2022 following a suspension during the pandemic, General Motors increased its payout from 3 cents per quarter to 12 cents at the beginning of the year.\n\nAlthough General Motors' annual dividend yield of 1.01% is still well below Ford\u2019s 4.85% it has crept closer to the S&P 500\u2019s 1.38% average with it being noteworthy that many auto stocks (including Tesla) don\u2019t offer a payout to shareholders as they are focused on growth.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway\n\nAfter such an extensive YTD rally, General Motors stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). To that point, there could be better buying opportunities ahead but longer-term investors should continue to be rewarded from current levels considering General Motors' increased profitability and cheap P/E valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "General Motors' (GM) JV Plant Strikes a Tentative Deal With UAW",
        "content": "General Motors\u2019 GM battery supplier plant has reached a tentative local agreement with the United Auto Workers (\u201cUAW\u201d). The facility, which is operated by Ultium Cells and is a joint venture (JV) between GM and South Korea's LG Energy Solution, saw its workforce unionize in December 2022, five months after production began.\r\n\r\nPer Shawn Fain, president of UAW, the agreement would raise most workers' hourly wages by $3.59 upon ratification. The agreement increases the top production wage from $20 to $35 after one year, raises the starting wage from $16.50 to $26.91 and includes improved health and safety measures.\r\n\r\nThe plant, employing 1,700 people, is near GM's former Lordstown Assembly Plant, which was idled in 2019 and sold to Lordstown Motors. A key issue in the UAW's recent negotiations with Detroit automakers was whether JV battery plant employees would be included in the national agreement with GM, granting them equal pay and benefits as assembly plant workers. During a 46-day strike last fall, GM agreed to include Ultium Cells employees in the master contract. When UAW members ratified the new contract with GM, Ultium Cells employees received an immediate pay raise of $6 to $8 per hour. The agreement also allowed former GM workers to transfer back to the area.\r\n\r\nPer Kevin Kelly, spokesperson of General Motors, the tentative agreement will now move to the ratification process. UAW posted highlights of the tentative agreement online, including 30% raises over three years, a $3,000 ratification bonus, immediate pay increases for skilled trades and enhanced health and safety provisions.\r\n\r\nThe two other Ultium Cells facilities are located in Spring Hill, Tennessee, and Lansing, which is currently under construction.\r\n\r\nAs automakers shift to EVs, battery plants have become key union battlegrounds, with UAW officials prioritizing job security and plant organization.\r\n\r\nAfter a six-week strike last fall, the UAW secured new labor deals with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, including a 25% wage increase and the return of cost-of-living adjustments. The agreement with GM brought Ultium workers under the master agreement, but the 1,600 UAW members at the plant must still approve the contract.\r\n\r\nThe UAW has faced challenges in organizing outside Detroit, including a defeat at a Mercedes plant in Alabama after a win at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee.\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nGM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the auto space are Blue Bird Corporation BLBD, Oshkosh Corporation OSK and American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc.

        "title": "3 Promising Penny Stocks With Millionaire-Maker Potential by 2028",
        "content": "The biggest headwind in the way of making millions from the market is not volatility or poor stock selection \u2014 it\u2019s impatience and exiting massive value creators early. In a world of meme stock investing, the horizon is possible in a few weeks or months. However, for wealth creation, nothing works like buying and holding with patience. This column focuses on potential millionaire-maker penny stocks to buy for multibagger returns by 2028.\n\nWithin the universe of penny stocks, there are hundreds of purely speculative ideas. However, there are businesses that can be listed among the high-quality growth stocks in the next few years. Of course, since we are dealing with penny ideas, it\u2019s important to keep a close watch on business developments.\n\nTherefore, the focus should be on how the business is progressing and not on how the stock is moving. I am emphasizing this point because industry headwinds can impact stock sentiment. However, any time or price correction will be compensated for swiftly when sentiments turn bullish. Therefore, let\u2019s talk about three millionaire-maker penny stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn interesting point about mining companies is that even if the market valuation declines significantly, the underlying mining assets are intact. This holds true for a company like Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) that trades at a market valuation of $660 million. However, the after-tax net present value of lithium assets of the company is $5.7 billion. With depressed sentiments on the back of a sharp decline in lithium prices, it\u2019s a good time to accumulate LAC stock.\n\nThe lithium mining company\u2019s asset, Thacker Pass, is a potential cash-flow machine. The asset has a mine life of 40 years. Further, once both phases are operational, the annual EBITDA visibility is $2 billion.\n\nSpecific to the company, the biggest challenge was financing the construction of the asset. In March, Lithium Americas received a conditional commitment for a $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. Further, in April, the miner closed a $275 million equity offering. General Motors (NYSE:GM) has also infused $650 million in two tranches. With financing secured, LAC stock is likely to go ballistic once lithium reverses.\n\nBitfarms (BITF) Bitcoin and crypto mining farm. Big data center. High tech server computers at work. Bitfarms (BITF) mines crypto.\n\nSource: PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn January, Cathie Wood opined that Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is likely to touch $1.5 million by 2030. While this call is debatable, there is no doubt that the cryptocurrency will continue to trend higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nWider adoption, limited supply, geopolitical tensions and a weaker dollar are just some factors that will support the rally. It\u2019s therefore a good time to consider fresh exposure and remain invested in Bitcoin mining stocks.\n\nBitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF) is an undervalued miner that seems poised for multibagger returns. The crypto mining company was in the news recently as it rejected the proposal from Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) to acquire 100% shares at $2.30 per common share. This underscores the confidence of the company to create value and indicates that BITF stock is undervalued at current levels.\n\nBitfarms has strong fundamentals with a zero-debt balance sheet. Further, the Bitcoin miner ended Q1 2024 with a liquidity buffer of $124 million. This provides ample flexibility to pursue aggressive expansion plans. Bitfarms is targeting to increase mining capacity from 7.5EH/s as of Q1 2024 to 21EH/s by the end of the year. This is likely to translate into stellar revenue and EBITDA growth.\n\nCronos (CRON) A marijuana leaf rests on top of little tins filled with a balm.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe cannabis story just seems to be unfolding as regulatory headwinds decline. Recently, Germany legalized cannabis and it\u2019s likely that other European countries will follow suit. Further, there is an impending reclassification of cannabis as a Schedule III drug in the U.S.\n\nWith upcoming presidential elections, there is a strong case for federal level legalization being a hot topic of discussion. Amidst these positives, Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) seems like a millionaire-maker.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Cronos has remained conservative in terms of expansion plans. The cannabis company has a robust cash buffer of $855 million that\u2019s likely to be utilized for organic and acquisition driven growth. With regulations becoming relatively investment friendly, some big investments might be on the cards.\n\nFurther, Cronos has presence in Canada, Israel, Germany, Australia and the United Kingdom. The company has entered three new countries in the last few quarters. This will have a positive impact on growth and with operating leverage, EBITDA break-even is close. Therefore, with multiple catalysts for stock upside, it\u2019s a good time to take a plunge.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "NVX: Positive Takeaways Recent EV Sales Trends",
        "content": "By M. Marin\n\nNASDAQ:NVX\n\nEV + hybrids 12.7% of Ford\u2019s \u201824 vehicle sales to-date vs 8.3% in same period of \u201823\u2026\n\nWe view strong 2024 electric vehicle (EV) sales as positive for Novonix (NASDAQ:NVX). Last week, Ford Motor Company provided statistics on vehicle sales to-date in 2024. Through the end of May, Ford had sold 37,208 EVs, up 87.8% year-over-year compared to 19,809 units during the same period of 2023. Sales of hybrid vehicles reached 74,049 units compared to 49,061 in 2023. That represents a 50.9% increase. EV sales are still relatively small as a percentage of total sales, but based on the 2024 data are gaining share versus traditional ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles. For example, EVs have thus far represented 4.2% of Ford\u2019s total vehicle sales in 2024 compared to 2.4% during the same period of 2023. EV and hybrids combined represented 12.7% of Ford\u2019s total vehicle sales in 2024 compared to 8.3% during the same period of 2023.\n\nSimilarly, the CEO of General Motors Company (GM) indicated that May 2024 was its best month ever for EV sales in North America, according to Investor\u2019s Business Daily, despite recent fluctuations reflecting, among other factors, Bolt. In July 2021, GM recalled certain 2017\u20132019 models of its Chevrolet Bolt EV. GM continues to reaffirm its stated \u201ccommitment to an all-electric future and meeting required fuel efficiency standards.\u201d\n\nEVs and hybrids comprise a small but growing fraction of the total number of cars sold in the world. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), EV \u201csales neared 14 million in 2023. The share of electric cars in total sales has increased from around 4% in 2020 to 18% in 2018.\u201d According to IEA data, the U.S. generally ranks among the largest markets in terms of new EV sales per annum.\n\nNumerous agreements to secure demand\n\nReflecting rising consumer adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and installations of electric storage systems (ESS), among other factors, demand for lithium-ion batteries is expected to grow significantly. To benefit from the anticipated surge in battery sales to power a variety of products, including EVs, consumer electronics and ESS, among others, Novonix\u2019s strategy is to become a tier-one global supplier in the rapidly growing advanced materials market and lithium-ion battery space.\n\nNVX has signed numerous agreements to secure demand for its advanced materials. For example, NVX recently signed a binding off-take agreement to supply high-performance synthetic graphite anode material to Panasonic Energy\u2019s North American operations. The materials will come from Novonix\u2019s Riverside facility, which is located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Panasonic Energy has agreed to purchase at least 10,000 tonnes of anode material over the 2025-2028 period for use in its U.S. plants, subject to Novonix achieving certain milestones regarding final mass production qualification timelines prior to 4Q25.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother recent agreement is with PowerCo SE, which is part of the Volkswagen Group and was formed for Volkswagen to bundle its global battery activities into one key operating group. PowerCo oversees Volkswagen\u2019s global factory operations, cell technology developments and vertical integration. PowerCo has identified three gigafactory locations with aggregate capacity of up to 200 GWh per annum. One is located in Salzgitter, Germany, which is where PowerCo is based. The other two are in Valencia, Spain and St. Thomas, Canada. The two have signed a non-exclusive Testing and Development Agreement (TDA) to develop, test and analyze synthetic graphite anode materials customized to meet PowerCo\u2019s requirements. If the results are successful, the two might then enter into a supply agreement for developed products. NVX has entered into similar agreements with others that have led to supply deals.\n\nIn addition, Novonix expects to commence delivery of anode material to Kore Power beginning in 2024. Initially, NVX will supply approximately 3,000 tpa to Kore in 2024 from the Riverside plant and ramp to approximately 12,000 tpa in 2028, to match Kore\u2019s required volume. Per the terms of an agreement with LG Energy Solution (LGES), LGES will have the option to purchase up to 50,000 tons of artificial graphite anode material over a 10-year period once mass production commences.\n\nWe view these and other agreements as significant positives for NVX and believe agreements with leading participants related to the battery cell space underscore the benefits of and validate Novonix\u2019s strategy. We anticipate additional agreements in the near- to medium-term, as NVX continues its strategy to secure demand in advance of commercial production at the Riverside plant. Moreover, these agreements fulfill an important component of the company\u2019s 2024 four key objectives:\n\n\u25aa Pursue / maintain industry leading R&D efforts for battery materials\n\n\u25aa Scale operations \u2013 NVX believes it is on-track for timeline to deliver commercial production\n\n\u25aa Secure new demand \u2013 NVX continues providing samples to major Tier 1 prospective customers\n\n\u25aa Obtain additional financing \u2013 NVX has been awarded funds from DOE, industrial leader partners\n\nNVX material shows ~30%-60% lower global warming potential\u2026\n\nNVX\u2019s \u2018cleaner\u2019 materials compared to that of competitors reflects its lower carbon intensive production method, as well as its proximity to North American end markets. In testing its materials, the company has found that they are as or more effective compared to other products. In a study comparing its synthetic anode graphite material to that supplied from China, the leading source of the material, Novonix material demonstrated a roughly 30% to 60% decrease in GWP (global warming potential) when compared to synthetic graphite produced in two key regions in China that account for a combined 79% of global production of synthetic anode material, according to the study.\n\n\u2026 and also outperforms for EV range, charge retention \u2026\n\nAll in all, the company has tested its anode materials compared to industry leading materials including a Tesla Model S cell used as a reference benchmark and based on test results, the company believes that its anode material outperforms in direct head-to-head testing.\n\nThe proximity of NVX\u2019s Tennessee plant also means that the overall distribution carbon footprint is likely to be lower than for that of materials from overseas competitors. The current supply of critical battery materials is sourced primarily from China (see below). Moreover, sourcing critical battery materials primarily from China has other potential risks, in our opinion, including possible delivery disruption due to logistics challenges and due to geopolitical challenges, particularly given sometimes shifting trade relations between China and the U.S.\n\nTariffs, other risks related to sourcing material from China \u2026\n\nManufacturers in China produce about 65% of the world's graphite, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and Chinese companies control an estimated 80+% of the market for automotive battery anodes. Moreover, sourcing critical battery materials primarily from China has potential risks, including geopolitical and economic. For example, tariffs and quotas can make materials supplied from China more costly and restrict the supply. Recently the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) announced new, extended or higher tariffs from China effective June 15, 2024. NVX expects this will make its material more competitively priced. This is also likely to encourage continued development of a North American supply chain, in our view. NVX believes China\u2019s measures underscore the need for North American producers to develop a local supply chain for battery materials in the U.S.\n\nRegulatory incentives in place to develop local battery space, supply chain\u2026\n\nConversely, the proximity of NVX\u2019s Tennessee plant is a competitive advantage compared to materials from China. Importantly, Novonix believes it has first mover advantage as an early manufacturer of synthetic graphite in North America. It also expects to benefit from regulatory incentives to develop clean energy sources. recent regulatory indications are favorable for NVX; synthetic graphite is eligible for rebates under government programs.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides economic incentives to companies that are developing a local supply chain for batteries and battery materials. These benefits support the production of critical minerals and battery materials such as synthetic graphite, for which Novonix will be eligible, and for local manufacturing of battery cells and Panasonic Energy\u2019s North American plants will qualify.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to\u00a0receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

        "title": "7 Stocks Warren Buffett Has Sold in the Past Year (and You Should Too)",
        "content": "The Oracle of Omaha is by far the most well-known long-term investor we have alive today, and if you are a newbie, looking into Warren Buffett stocks to sell is a good way to weed out the bad stocks from your portfolio. I believe Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) alone makes for a pretty good starter portfolio, as it acts like an exchange-traded fund with solid growth. However, if you have individual holdings and are targeting more growth, it still makes sense to mirror some of Buffett\u2019s moves.\n\nThis is a man who has been in the market for the past 82 years. He definitely knows the ins and outs of many sectors, so it can pay to research his buys and sells. I\u2019ll discuss seven stocks Buffett has sold in the past year and why you should consider trimming these positions yourself.\n\nThat said, I\u2019d warn you that you should stay away from shorting any of these stocks. Buffett only invests in quality, long-term businesses, and he also sells them when he sees that these stocks will deliver lower returns. It does not necessarily mean he expects total doom for these companies. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSirius XM (SIRI) The Sirius XM (SIRI) mobile app logo on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) provides satellite radio and audio entertainment services in North America. While the company reported a 7% increase in advertising revenue to a record $400 million, subscription revenue dropped by 1% year-over-year. I believe Sirius XM\u2019s growth story is losing steam as traditional radio continues to face secular declines. The company is betting big on podcasting, but that market appears to be reaching a saturation point as well.\n\nManagement touts a new SiriusXM app and digital infrastructure investments, but these moves seem more defensive than growth-oriented. With analysts projecting anemic 1% annual revenue growth ahead and earnings per share only expected to inch up from 30 cents to 39 cents by 2028, I\u2019m skeptical about the upside. Sirius XM\u2019s $9.6 billion debt load further constrains its flexibility.\n\nCEO Jennifer Witz cites \u201cpromising engagement indicators\u201d for the new app, but that feels like grasping at straws. Not much action is expected going forward. Warren Buffett stocks to sell: SIRI financials\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nUnless subscriptions reaccelerate markedly, I expect muted gains going forward. Sirius XM\u2019s best days may be behind us. Buffett trimmed his positions here by 8.85%.\n\nParamount Global (PARA) In this photo illustration, the Paramount Global (PARA) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nParamount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) is a media and entertainment company that owns CBS, Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, and Showtime. I\u2019m concerned about Paramount\u2019s stock, which plummeted by over 75% in the past five years despite some recent signs of financial recovery in its latest earnings report.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q1 2024, Paramount\u2019s total revenue increased by 6% to $7.7 billion and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization OIBDA by 80% to $987 million. Direct-to-consumer advertising revenue also increased 31%, driven by Pluto TV and Paramount+. However, the stock remains incredibly volatile.\n\nA big overhang is the potential merger with Skydance, which is reportedly on shaky ground. Shari Redstone, a major Paramount shareholder, is allegedly displeased with Skydance reducing its merger valuation from $5 billion to $4.75 billion. If this deal falls through, I worry the stock could decline even further.\n\nGiven the uncertainty around the Skydance deal and Paramount\u2019s long-term struggles, risk-averse investors may want to consider trimming positions for now. Buffett reduced his stake here by 88.1%.\n\nBristol-Myers (BMY) Bristol-Myers Squib (BMY) logo displayed on a phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) develops and sells biopharmaceutical products globally. The company reported Q1 revenue of $11.87 billion, up a modest 4.7% from a year ago, while posting a concerning loss of $4.40 per share.\n\nEliquis, Opdualag, Reblozyl, Yervoy, and Breyanzi showed strength in the quarter. However, the competitive pressures in the industry weighed on Abecma sales. Management believes they can return Abecma to growth with the recent KarMMa-3 approval, but I remain skeptical.\n\nInventory fluctuations and gross-to-net adjustments impacted Opdivo, Camzyos, and Sotyktu revenues, masking underlying demand growth. While Bristol-Myers made pipeline progress with new approvals and trial initiations, I don\u2019t see any potential blockbusters that could meaningfully accelerate growth.\n\nThe stock has been a falling knife, and bulls expect a major recovery ahead. That\u2019s certainly possible if everything goes right, but it will likely be a multi-year journey. I\u2019d consider trimming positions here. Investors seeking juicier returns are better off rotating into biopharma names with more exciting growth prospects in the near-to-medium term. Buffett\u2019s second portfolio in New England Asset Management slightly trimmed positions here.\n\nCelanese Corporation (CE) Detail of chemical plant, silos and pipes\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) manufactures and sells chemical products worldwide. At the same time, the company posted Q1 earnings per share of $2.08 that beat estimates by 17 cents, revenue of $2.61 billion missed by $71.76 million and declined 8.48% from a year ago. CEO Lori Ryerkerk noted that demand remains lackluster, especially in Europe and China exports. Construction and coatings end markets are still particularly weak.\n\nI\u2019m concerned about Celanese\u2019s bloated $13.8 billion debt load and uninspiring growth prospects. Analysts expect EPS to stay flat from 2025 to 2028 with anemic revenue growth. The stock\u2019s 1.9% dividend yield provides little consolation.\n\nTrading at nearly 13x forward earnings, Celanese looks overvalued, given its stagnant outlook. While management hopes for a second-half recovery, I don\u2019t see any imminent catalysts to reignite the stock. Cost pressures could further squeeze margins, too. Celanese corp margins\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nCelanese benefited from pandemic-era demand, but that tailwind has also reversed. With superior chemical plays available, I expect Celanese to underperform the sector going forward. Buffett sold his entire stake by Q3 2023.\n\nRH (RH) Restoration Hardware storefront exterior in North Carolina. RH stock.\n\nSource: CLS Digital Arts / Shutterstock\n\nRH (NYSE:RH) is a luxury home furnishings retailer. I believe the boom times for this company are long gone, and it\u2019s no surprise RH has been one of the biggest victims of the housing cooldown that started in late 2021. While there is solid demand for housing, costs have been stubbornly slow to come down. This leads me to believe we won\u2019t see particularly robust growth in the near term that would spark a meaningful recovery in RH shares.\n\nManagement expects a gradual rebound starting this year, but the most worrying trend is that EPS and revenue estimates have consistently moved lower over the past two years. RH is also saddled with a concerning $3.7 billion debt load. In my view, management made a critical misstep by spending billions on share buybacks when they should have prioritized debt reduction instead.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nIt finally froze buybacks last year, but I think RH stock will continue to underperform its peers going forward if current trends continue. Buffett sold all his RH last year.\n\nKeyCorp (KEY) a Keybank building\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nKeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) is a regional bank holding company based in Cleveland, Ohio. While KeyCorp\u2019s stock has staged an impressive recovery over the past year, I believe now may be an opportune time for investors to consider taking some profits off the table.\n\nThe bank\u2019s juicy 5.9% dividend yield is certainly the most compelling aspect of the stock at current levels. EPS growth guidance going forward seems solid. However, with the stock trading at a premium valuation, much of this optimism appears to be already baked into the price.\n\nI\u2019m particularly concerned about KeyCorp\u2019s substantial $25 billion debt load. This could become increasingly taxing in a higher-for-longer interest rate environment. The bank reported an 11% year-over-year decline in revenue to $1.53 billion and missed EPS estimates by 3 cents at 20 cents per share. While management remains upbeat, I suspect interest rate cuts won\u2019t come fast enough to justify chasing the stock at these levels. Income investors may still find the yield attractive, but I\u2019d be cautious about adding new money here. Buffett\u2019s New England Asset Management portfolio trimmed its positions here.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) manufactures and sells automobiles worldwide. While GM posted solid Q1 results with EPS and revenue beats, I believe it may be time to consider taking some profits off the table. Sure, the company is executing well in the near term, with strong performance from its pickups, SUVs, and growing EV portfolio. However, looking ahead, earnings are projected to remain flat starting next year and potentially decline thereafter. GM EPS estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nGM does generate robust cash flow and announced a $10 billion buyback last year, but I think increasing the dividend would have been more prudent. The current 1% yield seems insufficient to address long-term concerns if earnings stagnate as expected. With $124.6 billion in debt and only $20.5 billion in cash, GM\u2019s balance sheet isn\u2019t exactly fortress-like.\n\nMost of GM\u2019s strengths appear priced in at current levels. I don\u2019t see a compelling case for meaningful upside in the years ahead. While it may be a controversial call, I\u2019d consider trimming. Buffett sold his entire GM stake in Q3 2023.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Nora Eckert\n\n(Reuters) -The United Auto Workers union said on Monday it reached a tentative contract agreement with Ultium Cells in Lordstown, Ohio, where workers build electric vehicle batteries for General Motors.\n\nUltium Cells is a joint venture between GM and LG Energy Solution. Hourly workers at the Ohio plant near Cleveland, which GM previously shuttered, voted in favor of joining the union in December 2022.\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain said the deal would raise the starting wage to $26.91 an hour, which had been $16.50 last year and was raised to $20 by the company in August.\n\nWorkers will see wages rise to $35 an hour after one year on the job by the end of the deal, the union said. The deal includes a 30% wage increase over three years for many workers, and a $3,000 ratification bonus.\n\nAs automakers pivot to producing electric vehicles (EVs), their battery plants have become a battleground for the union. UAW officials have voiced concerns about members' job security as the industry begins rolling out more battery-powered models, and Fain has made organizing these plants a priority.\n\nAfter a six-week strike last fall, the automotive union forged new labor deals with the Detroit automakers: GM, Ford Motor and Jeep-maker Stellantis.\n\nThe deals with the Detroit Three included a 25% wage increase over the four-and-a-half year contract as well as the return of cost-of-living adjustments.\n\nCrafting the agreement with GM brought Ultium workers under the union's master agreement, its officials have said.\n\nThe 1,600 UAW members at the plant must still approve the contract.\n\nThe UAW has recently encountered significant hurdles in its organizing efforts outside of Detroit. After a historic win at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee, the automotive union was defeated at a Mercedes plant in Alabama during a May vote.\n\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri and Bill Berkrot)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "General Motors Company (GM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "General Motors (GM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this an automotive manufacturer have returned +1.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors falls in, has gained 0.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, General Motors is expected to post earnings of $2.59 per share, indicating a change of +35.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.40 points to a change of +22.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.51 indicates a change of +1.2% from what General Motors is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for General Motors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor General Motors, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $44.94 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $174.72 billion and $175.39 billion estimates indicate +1.7% and +0.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGeneral Motors reported revenues of $43.01 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.6%. EPS of $2.62 for the same period compares with $2.21 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.29 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.18%. The EPS surprise was +25.96%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGeneral Motors is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The best auto stocks are those successfully navigating rough economic waters as investors look for safer opportunities. Amidst the geopolitical tensions, heightened inflation, and recessionary headwinds, the auto space is under major duress. The downturn is aggravated further by the intense competition in its niche. However, the savvy investor will want to pounce on the opportunity and wager on the best auto stocks offering robust upside potential ahead.\n\nThe automotive sector is far from the easiest sector to place your bets on. It\u2019s a cyclical and capital-intensive industry that remains heavily unionized and competitive. On top of that, carmakers need to continue investing in new models in their efforts to outperform their rivals.\n\nHowever, the current economic scenario has put the brakes on the sector\u2019s growth trajectory, with more pain ahead given the \u2018higher for longer\u2019 narrative for interest rates. Nevertheless, with auto stocks trading at attractive levels, it\u2019s an excellent time for investors to load up on some of the sector\u2019s finest.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFord (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord (NYSE:F) stands out as one of the most attractive stocks among traditional automakers. 2023 was a remarkably tough year for the business, with macro-headwinds and the United Auto Workers (UAW) strikes putting the brakes on F stock\u2019s momentum. It now trades under 0.30 times forward sales estimates, more than 65% lower than the sector median.\n\nHowever, on the financial front, things are looking up for its business. \u00a0It posted a strong top-and-bottom-line beat in its first quarter (Q1), posting a healthy 3.2% year-over-year (YOY) growth in sales, reaching $42.8 billion. Moreover, its non-GAAP EPS of 49 cents per share beat estimates by five cents. The stellar growth in its top line was led by the success of its commercial wing in Ford Pro, which saw sales jump 40% in Q1.\n\nAdditionally, Ford is well-positioned to capitalize on the transition towards EVs and hybrids. Its hybrid models in particular, including the Escape, Maverick, and F-150, have witnessed a tremendous 36% increase in global sales. Moreover, in addition to its investment proposition, Ford\u2019s management announced a special dividend of 18 cents per share, supplementing its regular 15-cent dividend.\n\nBYD Company (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nBYD Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) is a giant in the EV space that has established its position at the top of the heap. What sets it apart from its peers is its consistent performance and delivery, indicative of its robust, strong brand equity despite market headwinds.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt released another stunner of a deliveries report, where new energy vehicle sales increased by 38.1% in May to 331,817 units. This impressive increase is led by a strong 54.1% jump in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), setting a new monthly record with 184,093 units sold. Additionally, battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales shot up 22.4%, reinforcing the firm\u2019s powerful portfolio.\n\nBeyond these numbers, BYD continues turning heads with its new offerings, such as the flagship \u201cShark\u201d pickup truck, which rivals the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0Cybertruck. Moreover, it plans to release a low-priced EV called the Seagull, effectively blending innovation and value.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logo\n\nSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is another titan in the global automotive space, and it continues to shine through its diversified operational framework spanning multiple segments. This strategy effectively shields it from market volatility while positioning it well to seize opportunities across various markets with aplomb.\n\nIn Q1, GM flexed its muscles again, posting an 8% increase in sales on a YOY basis to $43 billion. The uptick was led by discounts, with U.S. retail sales rising 6%. Additionally, its adjusted EPS witnessed a 19% jump from the prior-year period, indicative of its superior sales strategies and healthy profit margins.\n\nAdding to its compelling bull case was its bold announcement late last year to increase shareholder rewards. Starting this year, it announced a whopping $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program and a 33% dividend increase. These heartening moves suggest that GM is looking to enhance investor returns and reinforce GM\u2019s standing as a resilient leader in its niche.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Energy Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Energy remains a quintessential resource because it\u2019s everywhere. From your car, house lights and even air conditioner, energy is ubiquitous. However, amidst the current \u201cenergy revolution\u201d where a larger emphasis is now put on developing clean renewable energy, the current energy situation seems more uncertain than ever before.\n\nAmidst larger geopolitical concerns with traditional energy sources and interest rate pressures on newer renewables, we currently are sitting at a crossroads where both sources hold their pros and cons. This, of course, situates investors in a difficult situation on how to best diversify their energy stock picks.\n\nHence, exploring quality energy stocks, both clean and traditional, is of the utmost importance currently. In this article, we\u2019ll dive into different types of energy stocks which all have their own specialties and importance to the energy industry. The common denominator? They are all undervalued energy stocks candidates for any investors\u2019 portfolios this June.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) produces and markets sustainable electricity and power solutions for infrastructure all over North America. Currently, Yahoo! Finance analysts project a one-year price range between $46 and $102, with an average of $76.\n\nRecently, the company announced its plan to invest over $18.3 billion into clean and renewable energy sources and over $43.8 billion in total to their growing infrastructure from 2024 to 2028. By expanding its clean energy sources, NextEra gets one step closer to achieving its sustainability goals while still allotting over $20 billion other dollars to diversify its assets. While the upcoming election does pose pressures on renewable energy credits, we see NEE\u2019s bolstering of assets on multiple fronts as a safe growth mitigant to potential volatility.\n\nLooking at the financials, we see NEE has boasted impressive year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth statistics while keeping its operational costs nearly constant. From 2022 to 2023, YOY revenue growth was 34.15% while the cost of revenue remained at a constant 10 billion dollars, showing NextEra\u2019s ability to scale its business efficiently. Given that its EV/EBITDA ratio of 16.17x sits at an almost 30% discount to its historical 5-year average currently, NextEra stands as an amazing option among undervalued energy stocks for any investor this June.\n\nHalliburton Company (HAL) Halliburton (HAL) logo on a smartphone screen being held up by a hand with a stock chart in the background\n\nSource: Trismegist san / Shutterstock.com\n\nHalliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) operates in over 70 countries and focuses on the exploration and extraction of oil and natural gas. Yahoo! Finance analysts currently forecast a one-year price target between an average of $48.31 and a high of $54.\n\nStory continues\n\nHalliburton has spent well over $64 million on savvy acquisitions to expand their operations worldwide. By combining its two business sectors: completion/production and drilling/evaluation into worldwide operations, the company has an undeniable foot in oil and gas production, making it the second largest producer in the world. As the overall shale industry makes its way toward a focus on cash flow and profitability, HAL will no doubt benefit from higher margins and valuable market positioning.\n\nThe company\u2019s financials are equally impressive, with YOY EPS growth hitting nearly 70%! Valuation-wise, its P/E ratio of 11.76x sits sound below the Oil and Gas Equipment industry average of 14.27x, demonstrating how the stock is well undervalued at its current price. Combining the stock\u2019s undervalued nature with its healthy, worldwide operations makes Halliburton a great undervalued energy stocks position for any investor.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logo\n\nSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is an automobile manufacturer best known for its production of Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac, and GMC. While this may seem like an unconventional energy pick, GM\u2019s focus on the development of electric vehicles and related home energy applications has been key toward pushing Yahoo! Finance analysts toward maintaining a bullish one-year price target between an average of $54 to a high of $96.\n\nFor the past five years, General Motors has invested over $35 billion into the production of electric vehicles and the charging they require, outweighing the company\u2019s investment in gas and diesel car production. Additionally, the company has come forth with countless energy infrastructure developments, including enterprise and residential energy services. As these investments embrace the company\u2019s vision of an \u201call-electric future,\u201d GM remains an undervalued tangential growth company to look out for as the energy industry reaches its turning point.\n\nGeneral Motors\u2019 financials also remain impressive, as it boasts solid YOY EPS and revenue growth of 19.1% and 9.7% respectively. Its P/E ratio of 5.53x also sits far below the industry average of 20.37x, positioning it at an extremely undervalued price point. All of these factors should make any investor\u2019s mouth water, for the company is making strides toward clean energy while keeping its solid financial grounding.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "As sales dwindle and profit margins shrink for megalithic electric vehicle stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the industry faces scrutiny over its current trajectory. Despite a surge in adoption over recent years, tightening economic conditions are pricing many consumers out of the high-end electric vehicle market.\n\nNevertheless, electric vehicles are here to stay. Likewise, the industry\u2019s prevailing bearish sentiment offers a strategic opportunity to invest in lesser-known electric vehicle stocks that are currently undervalued relative to their long-term potential.\n\nFor those looking to diversify their electric vehicle stocks, finding under-the-radar electric vehicle stocks that support the wider industry is better than betting the bank on a single-source manufacturer or brand. These companies are positioned to capitalize on widespread industry trends and offer a safer bet on the electric vehicle market\u2019s growth, avoiding the risks associated with investing in single, speculative electric vehicle stocks that may struggle to endure over the next decade.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAehr Test Systems (AEHR) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR) may not be as widely recognized as semiconductor giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Still the small-cap semiconductor stock distinguishes itself among electric vehicle stocks as a lesser-known but pivotal player. Last year, Aehr snagged a hefty $25.1 million order to support EV production from a \u201cleading Fortune 500 supplier of semiconductor devices\u201d serving the automotive semiconductor market.\n\nThe announcement details are intentionally sparse, but the implications are clear. As electric vehicles increasingly depend on sophisticated semiconductor technology, concurrent demand for specialized testing and quality assurance services like Aehr\u2019s will rise.\n\nBeyond its status as an electric vehicle stock, Aehr is in an advantageous position in a burgeoning series of industries. Regardless of which semiconductor manufacturer leads the market or which electric vehicle manufacturer dominates the roads, Aehr stands to benefit. The company\u2019s involvement spans beyond electric vehicles, including critical roles in 5G, autonomous vehicles, and data center infrastructure. This broad engagement makes Aehr Test Systems an ideal investment for those looking to tap into multiple cutting-edge technological trends, marking it as a hidden gem among electric vehicle stocks.\n\nMagna International (MGA) A Magna International (MGA) sign is on the front of a Magna building in Ontario, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMagna International (NYSE:MGA) is a key supplier of automotive parts to major players in the electric vehicle industry, including Tesla and General Motors (NYSE:GM). Much like Aehr, Magna\u2019s broad market presence ensures that it benefits no matter which electric vehicle manufacturer leads the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn its latest financial report, Magna\u2019s sales rose by 3% year-over-year, and the company is leveraging the momentum in the electric vehicle sector to increase its income forecasts for the remainder of 2024. Although its profit margins are tight\u2014high operational costs keep profits below $9 million despite consistently generating over $11 billion in revenue\u2014Magna\u2019s financial performance remains stable, securing its position as a solid EV investment within a diversified portfolio.\n\nMoreover, Magna stands out by offering shareholder returns, unlike many electric vehicle stocks that sacrifice dividends for growth. With a current dividend yield of 4.29%, MGA provides a modest yet valuable income stream, making it an attractive option for investors looking to build a well-rounded electric vehicle stock portfolio.\n\nChargePoint Holdings (CHPT) Selective focus. Detail of ChargePoint commercial EV electric vehicle charging station on uncovered parking lot. CHPT stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT) shares suffered mightily in recent years, dropping more than 80% since June 2023. Despite recently reporting a per-share loss of $0.11, ChargePoint\u2019s revenue beat analyst expectations. The company\u2019s struggles are not due to flaws in its business model or its overall market viability but are largely the result of external economic pressures that are showing signs of easing.\n\nExpanding and maintaining a national electric vehicle charging network requires substantial capital. Previously, low interest rates made it feasible for companies like ChargePoint to borrow against future profits for immediate expansion. However, recent Federal Reserve rate hikes curtailed this strategy, forcing ChargePoint to seek alternative financing methods that impacted its profitability. Still, as the market anticipates a series of rate cuts in 2024, ChargePoint\u2019s prospects are improving\u2014and, in penny stock territory, it\u2019s priced to buy. Should these forecasts materialize, ChargePoint\u2019s leading market share could position it as a prime candidate among top electric vehicle stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About General Motors (GM): Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about General Motors (GM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nGeneral Motors currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.83, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 23 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.83 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 23 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.9% and 4.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GM Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for GM\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for General Motors here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying General Motors, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs GM a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for General Motors, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $9.40.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for General Motors. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for General Motors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "GM And Ford Show Electric Pickups And SUVs Refute The EV Slowdown",
        "content": "GM And Ford Show Electric Pickups And SUVs Refute The EV Slowdown\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE: GM) CEO Mary\u00a0Barra assured investors that electrification is well underway with May being GM\u2019s best ever EV sales month, defying the slowdown even the EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA),\u00a0is struggling with. The EV push is owed to\u00a0ongoing growth\u00a0for Cadillac Lyriq, Chevrolet Blazer EV, GMC Hummer EV and Chevrolet Silverado EV, but more will be known when GM reports its second quarter results in July. Barra also noted that GM still expects\u00a02024\u00a0to\u00a0be a record year of EV sales.\n\nDespite the slowdown, GM insists it remains committed to its EV future. Barra also stated that the market will determine the timing of its EV transition and when will GM phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. GM did not officially alter its commitment to make\u00a0all-electric\u00a0vehicles by 2035, although some confusion was caused by Barra\u2019s interview on Tuesday where she mentioned the EV transformation is going to happen over decades. But, the bottom line is that despite both GM and Ford Motor (NYSE: F) scaling back their EV ambitions, they remain on the EV track.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ford reported its EV sales in the U.S. surged 88% during the first five months of the year,\u00a0also defying the trend that\u00a0Tesla reported. In May alone, Ford reported its EV sales in the U.S. rose almost 65% YoY as it sold 8,966 EVs. More specifically, Ford reported its E-transit van experienced a 77% rise, the electric F-150 pickup, the Lightning, reported an impressive 91% growth and Mach-E\u00a0also went up\u00a045.9%. What\u2019s even more impressive is that Ford achieved such impressive growth amid intense competition from the EV king itself, Tesla, with the F-150 going against the Cybertruck and the Mach-E going up against\u00a0Model Y\u00a0on the SUV front. This is another blow for Tesla, after Ford already refuted Tesla CEO\u2019s claims that everyone had a tough first quarter, during which Ford sold 20,223 EVs. But, Ford still expects its EV business to widen its EBIT loss this year, as it guided it to be\u00a0between $5.5 billion and $5 billion\u00a0for the full year.\n\nA\u00a0U.S.-based manufacturer and innovator of hybrid and clean energy solutions for the light trucks,\u00a0Worksport Ltd. (NASDAQ: WKSP), aims to\u00a0revolutionize the\u00a0automotive accessory\u00a0market with its integrated solar technology\u00a0aimed at pickup trucks. Worksport is expected to release the world\u2019s first solar-powered tonneau cover this summer. The highly anticipated SOLIS will be available for the best-selling vehicles in the U.S., including\u00a0the Ford\u00a0Motor\u00a0F-150,Stellantis (NYSE: STLA)\u00a0RAM 1500, and\u00a0GM\u00a0Chevy Silverado.\u00a0In addition, Solis will gain a power partner, a portable battery generator, COR that will provide off-grid power on the go to even those who don\u2019t drive pickups, while easing the range anxiety of electric pickup drivers. Usurprisingly, Worksport has recently projected\u00a0a robust\u00a0300\u00a0to\u00a0433%\u00a0YoY\u00a0revenue\u00a0growth for full the full year and this projection is only based on its automotive accesory business, with the above launches bringing further revenue potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nWorksport just revealed it made a\u00a0new sales partnership with a prominent Midwest distributor, renowned for its 50-year legacy in the automotive industry.\u00a0This\u00a0strategic expansion into the Midwest\u00a0is merely an example of Worksport\u2019s\u00a0aggressive growth plans and its\u00a0expanding presence in the automotive industry\u00a0it aims to redefine with its clean energy innovations. With its\u00a0soft\u00a0covers,\u00a0made-in-America AL3 Hard Covers\u00a0and\u00a0highly\u00a0anticipated AL4\u00a0covers,\u00a0Worksport\u00a0aims to strengthen its\u00a0brand's visibility among American consumers and strengthen\u00a0its\u00a0position in the market\u00a0as it gets ready to make a big debut in revolutionizing transportation with its groundbreaking clean energy solutions.\n\nAll in all, electric pickups and SUVs seem to have what it takes to refute the EV slowdown.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "TM Stock Analysis: Why Toyota Is the EV Stock to Beat",
        "content": "Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) is the best electric vehicle manufacturer on the market bar none. TM stock might be the only EV maker worth investing in. The Japanese car company avoided the dramatic retrenching of its EV-focused rivals due to its healthy skepticism.\n\nToyota chose a diverse approach to EVs instead of focusing on just one type. The leading car manufacturer prioritizes hybrid vehicles, despite producing all-electric battery EVs like its competitors. This proved prescient as BEV demand declines and hybrid sales surge.\n\nNow with even Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) hedging their EV bets and swinging to the production of more hybrids, Toyota stands head and shoulders above the competition. It is way out in front of the pack and will be the dominant leader for some time to come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlways Thinking About Tomorrow\n\nToyota has long been well ahead of the industry when it comes to making green vehicles.\n\nGoing as far back as the 1950s when it first introduced its cars to the U.S. market, they got excellent gas mileage. They might not have sold particularly well back then but the oil shocks of the 1970s and 1980s changed that.\n\nWhile Detroit was consumed with still making gas guzzlers, Toyota was manufacturing cars that sipped gasoline, getting 30 miles per gallon.\n\nIt catapulted the Japanese automaker to the forefront of the industry. By the mid-2000s, Toyota surpassed GM as the world\u2019s largest car seller, a position it has never relinquished.\n\nYet it was 2001\u2019s introduction of the Prius that Toyota displayed its forward thinking and put itself ahead of the competition once again.\n\nWith gas mileage exceeding 50 mpg, it was an instant driver favorite. Since then, Toyota has continued to explore alternatives to mainstream thinking.\n\nNot only is Toyota the premier hybrid automaker, but it has invested heavily in hydrogen fuel cells, and not just for vehicles.\n\nIt is building Woven City, a 175-acre smart city powered by hydrogen fuel cells to test new technology, including autonomous vehicles and smart homes.\n\nIt has created the MONET Technologies joint venture with Softbank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) and other Japanese automakers to develop autonomous vehicle services.\n\nIt has a battery JV with Panasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRHY) to develop EV batteries with a 1,000 kilometer range.\n\nThe Future of TM Stock\n\nThese are not just technologies for the future. Toyota plans to implement them today.\n\nIts new batteries, for example, will appear in its 2026 model vehicles that will feature gigacasting manufacturing and a new computer operating system called Arene that may turn Toyota into the \u201cApple of EVs.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThese are advanced technologies Toyota is deploying that others are shrinking away from.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), for example, was supposed to begin using gigacasting manufacturing but has since abandoned the idea.\n\nGigacasting is like die casting Hot Wheels cars. It stamps out the underbody of a vehicle, which typically contain hundreds of pieces, as a single unit.\n\nWhere Toyota is moving forward with gigacasting, Tesla is sticking with its current three-part underbody.\n\nAnd to cut costs further, Toyota is expanding its manufacturing operations outside of Japan.\n\nWhile almost 80% of the automaker\u2019s sales come from outside Japan, less than two-thirds of its manufacturing plants are located elsewhere. Getting manufacturing closer to its customers will save more money.\n\nThe Real EV Road Ahead\n\nToyota enjoyed massive profits in 2023 as its hybrid sales took off. It sold 3.4 million hybrids last year, up 31% from the 2.6 million it sold in 2022. BEVs, on the other hand, accounted for less than 1% of all the vehicles it sold, or some 104,000 vehicles.\n\nThat continued in the first quarter where sales surged 20% from the year-ago period. EVs of all kinds now account for nearly 37% of total sales.\n\nYet Toyota doesn\u2019t think BEVs will ever be a winning bet. The CEO of Toyota North America Ted Ogawa called them a \u201cwasted investment.\u201d It thinks they will garner just 30% of the total electric vehicle market.\n\nHybrid vehicles, fuel-cell EVs and hydrogen cars will account for the other 70%.\n\nWith Toyota Motor\u2019s leadership position in all of those markets, its stock is a buy today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In the latest trading session, General Motors (GM) closed at $45.26, marking a -1.05% move from the previous day. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.15% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.36%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.17%.\n\nShares of the an automotive manufacturer witnessed a gain of 1.51% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector with its loss of 3.95% and underperforming the S&P 500's gain of 3.2%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of General Motors in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.59, reflecting a 35.6% increase from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $44.94 billion, up 0.43% from the year-ago period.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $9.40 per share and revenue of $174.72 billion, indicating changes of +22.4% and +1.68%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for General Motors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.46% decrease. General Motors is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, General Motors is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 4.87. This denotes a discount relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 12.77.\n\nWe can additionally observe that GM currently boasts a PEG ratio of 0.53. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

        "title": "Ford CEO on the future of EVs, Detroit, and his relationship with Tesla's Elon Musk",
        "content": "Inside an 111-year old former Detroit train station, Ford (F) CEO Jim Farley is charting a path for the auto giant's next 100 years.\n\nJust don't expect it to include electric trains.\n\n\"The building's really been revitalized physically, but what's important is that it will have software people here, the future of our pro and our EV business will be down here,\" Farley told me in a new episode of Yahoo Finance's \"Opening Bid\" podcast (video above).\n\nWe are sitting smack in the middle of Michigan Central Station in Detroit's Corktown neighborhood. Constructed in 1913, the station ran trains for about 75 years before officially closing in 1988 due to waning ridership \u2014 a byproduct of Detroit's manufacturing decline.\n\nThe 472,000 square foot building, decked out in early 1900s architecture, stood abandoned until 2018. Led by executive chairman Bill Ford, Ford purchased the building and several surrounding locations for $90 million, with a vision to re-establish Detroit as an epicenter for high tech jobs.\n\nClose to $1 billion of renovation work later, the rehabbed Michigan Central Station is now the center of a new mobility innovation district.\n\nThe central building will house Ford employees working on autonomous vehicle projects. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) also signed on in 2022 as a founding member of the district.\n\nGoogle will share its cloud technology for the site's various mobility projects. The company will also offer workplace development training to local high school students and job seekers.\n\nOver time, Ford envisions the mixed-use site to include hotel and retail options to lure in vital tech talent to the rebuilding city.\n\nFarley says the development should help the company attract the best and brightest to develop autonomous and electric vehicles. Built in 1913, Michigan Central Station in Detroit reopens after 36 years after close to $1 billion in investments from Ford. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nThe reopening arrives at a critical time for Ford and the race-car driving Farley, who will reach his four-year mark as CEO in October.\n\nFord's stock has downshifted in the past two years, as the company dealt with issues like quality control, a slowdown in the EV market, and losses in the EV business. Under Farley's watch, Ford debuted the Mustang Mach-e SUV and Lightning F-150 pickup to compete in an EV market led by Tesla (TSLA).\n\nHe also struck up a partnership with Tesla to allow Ford EVs to charge at its Superchargers using adapters. That partnership has created a relationship with Musk, who Farley says he just texted the other day to ask for more charging adapters.\n\n\"I think there is a mutual respect,\" Farley says of his relationship with Musk.\n\nStory continues\n\nFord's shares are down 14% in the past two years according to Yahoo Finance data, lagging the 28% gain for the S&P 500. Its rival GM's stock has gained 12% in that span, supported by stock buybacks and aggressive cost cuts.\n\nFarley has pivoted as market conditions evolved.\n\nThe company said in April it would push back the release of its three-row electric vehicles from 2025 to 2027. It's also delaying EV production at the massive BlueOval City EV campus in Tennessee from 2025 to 2026.\n\nIn October 2023, Ford postponed $12 billion in planned EV spending, including the construction of a new battery factory in Kentucky. But the company committed to making more hybrids to bridge the gap during the EV transition.\n\nA more cost-minded Ford is beginning to show up on the company's balance sheet.\n\nIn April, Ford guided to the high-end of $10 billion to $12 billion for full year operating profits. Adjusted free cash flow guidance was lifted to $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion \u2014 previously the range stood at $6 billion to $7 billion.\n\n\"If Ford can continue executing in the coming quarters, the stock should benefit from positive EPS revisions and an increasingly compelling case for multiple expansion post last year\u2019s re-segmentation \u2014 all anchored by a strong B/S & improved FCF conversion,\" Citi analyst Itay Michaeli wrote in a recent client note.\n\nEven still, the EV division will likely be the one driving the stock's narrative \u2014 though the narrative hasn't been a bullish one.\n\nThe Model e division (Ford's electric segment) lost $1.32 billion in the first quarter on $100 million in sales (down 84% compared to last year). The number of vehicles sold for the division fell 20% year over year, as consumers navigated away from EVs despite price cuts.\n\nThe Model e division is on track for $5 billion in operating losses this year.\n\nFarley says he has a date in mind for EV profitability, but declined to share.\n\n\"We wouldn't allocate capital if I didn\u2019t think it was profitable,\" he said.\n\nWatch what Ford's longtime competitor General Motors is up to in a recent episode of Yahoo Finance's \"Lead This Way.\" CEO Mary Barra says she isn't backing down on EVs.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "2 Stocks to Avoid in 2024",
        "content": "In the investing game, knowing what stock not to buy is equally important as knowing which stocks to own. Two industries that I find particularly weak are autos and airlines. These industries face tough competition and low stock valuations. Two companies in particular are lagging behind the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by a fair margin. They face significant hurdles in their businesses that will need to be overcome before their shares can compete with the broader market.\n\n1. Ford\n\nI love cars as much as the next person, but car companies are not always the best investments. Shares of Ford Motor Company(NYSE: F) have underperformed the S&P 500 by roughly 53% over the last five years.\n\nIt's easy to fall into the value trap with stocks like Ford, which trades at less than 13 times earnings. The problem is that auto stocks, with the exception of the wild ride that is Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA), rarely see their earnings multiples rise above the high single to low double digits. That means they have to create remarkable financial growth for their stocks to have big gains.\n\nThe headache for Ford this year is electric vehicles (EVs). It reported a $1.3 billion loss on its EV sales in the first quarter of the year.\n\nThat's right -- the future of automobiles is beating up Ford. What's worse, the headache is likely to continue for the rest of the year. Management reported that this year it expects $5 billion in losses as measured by earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from its Model e cars, which is Ford's line of EVs.\n\nIt's not that Ford hasn't created some good growth. Revenue increased 16% in 2022 and 11.47% in 2023.\n\nThe problem is that investors are not willing to forget the calamity of the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent bankruptcy of several major automakers. It has been clear over the last decade that investors have very little intention of paying large premiums for shares of major automakers. GeneralMotors(NYSE: GM) trades at less than 6 times earnings; Toyota(NYSE: TM) trades at less than 10 times earnings.\n\nInvestors just don't seem comfortable paying big premiums for a sector that is so exposed to economic weakness. Whether it's a traditional internal combustion engine or an EV, most of us are going to be less keen to buy a new car if the economy tanks. Because of that, investors are rightly justified in being cautious about valuations when it comes to car stocks.\n\n2. Spirit Airlines\n\nTo say that Spirit Airlines(NYSE: SAVE) has had a rough year would be an understatement. Shares are down by a painful 77% after the hoped-for merger with JetBlue(NASDAQ: JBLU) was blocked by regulators.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was a pretty devastating blow for a company that has been bleeding cash for several quarters. Travel has rebounded from the worst of the pandemic, but Spirit's performance has not.\n\nThe low-cost airline has consistently lost hundreds of millions of dollars annually since 2020 despite some fairly decent revenue performance. Collectively, Spirit has lost $1.9 billion over the last four years, and 2024 is set to be disappointing as well.\n\nThe first quarter was a rough start, with operating revenue declining by 6.2% year over year and operating losses increasing 84.5% to $207.3 million. Spirit expects continued losses for the second quarter. To make matters worse, the airline expects to have roughly 70 jets out of service in 2025, which will cause further problems with operating costs.\n\nSimply put, Spirit was too dependent on a buyout. It seems fairly clear that the airline is going to struggle on its own. With JetBlue now out of the running and Spirit accumulating fairly significant debts that it will have to pay back, the risk is simply too high to gamble on this one.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ford Motor Company right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ford Motor Company, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ford Motor Company wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "MicroCloud Hologram Outlook: Run for the Hills, HOLO Stock Investors!",
        "content": "China\u2019s MicroCloud Hologram (NASDAQ:HOLO) is generating very low revenue, and its sales have declined sharply in recent quarters. What\u2019s more, demand for its technology is unlikely to surge anytime soon. The firm has provided very little information about its customers and the outlook of its business. Given these points, I urge investors to sell HOLO stock.\n\nUnimpressive Revenue and Dim Prospects\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, MicroCloud\u2019s top line came in at only $7.4 million. That was a meaningful decline compared to the $9.2 million it generated in the year-ago period. Similarly, in Q3 of 2023, it reported sales of $7.2 million. That is way below the $24.2 million of revenue that it managed to generate in Q3 of 2022. In other words, its business appears to be headed in the wrong direction.\n\nMicroCloud says it is \u201cone of the leading holographic digitalisation technology service providers in China.\u201d It notes its technology can be used to develop advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMy research, though, suggests there is not a great deal of interest among automakers in using holographic technology to facilitate ADAS. After numerous good-faith searches, it appears automakers are not investing much money into the technology for this purpose.\n\nLast year, four automakers invested $50 million in a company called Envisics which makes holographic displays for vehicles. However, only two companies \u2014 General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Jaguar Land Rover \u2014 were slated to incorporate the technology in any of their vehicles. I did find one other article about holographic technology in vehicles. The article noted that Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMTF) and several other automakers had displayed \u201cHolographic augmented reality (AR) for vehicles\u201d at the CES technology show in 2020. \u00a0The AR, which provides alerts and \u201cguidance\u201d to drivers, does not appear to ever have been incorporated into any vehicles.\n\nMoreover, holographic displays seem to constitute a relatively small component of ADAS, as they are primarily used to provide information and alerts to drivers.\n\nGiven the relatively low interest in holograms by automakers for ADAS and the fact that they are not a major component of ADAS, I\u2019m not confident that MicroCloud will be able to generate much revenue from this\n\nA Lack of Information\n\nAfter extensively examining MicroCloud\u2019s website, I could not find any information about its customers, or deals that it has made. I also did not see any indications that it has significant opportunities going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Seeking Alphadid republish a November 2023 press release from the company which, for some reason, is not on its website. The release states that the company will provide a Generalized Streaming Media Control System for a major, unnamed Chinese automaker. Based on the information in the release, it appears that the automaker in question is BYD (OTC:BYDDF).\n\nBYD is a hugely successful company as it sold 3 million vehicles in 2023. Still, MicroCloud did not specify how many of BYD\u2019s vehicles would use its CMS. As a result, I would not be surprised if the firm is only providing CMS for a few thousand vehicles for testing.\n\nAlso, I know from years of reading about BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) that providing entertainment systems for vehicles is not particularly lucrative. Historically, BlackBerry has only received a few dollars per vehicle for providing automobiles\u2019 entertainment systems.\n\nVery Limited Institutional Ownership of HOLO Stock and the Bottom Line on MicroCloud\n\nAnother negative sign for MicroCloud is few institutional investors own the stock. At the end of last quarter, slightly less than 400,000 shares, or 6.7%, were owned by institutional investors. The largest investment in the company among institutions amounted to $500,000. The lack of interest in the name by large investors is another red flag for HOLO stock.\n\nMicroCloud is generating very low sales and its revenue has dropped sharply over the last year. Moreover, there are no signs that the company\u2019s fortunes can turn around anytime soon. As a consequence of these points, investors should sell HOLO stock.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions,\u00a0InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of\u00a0less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "content": "Wall Street\u2019s robust companies potentially offer strong returns for retirement portfolios. Such retirement stocks have a history of consistent performance and strategic positioning in their respective industries, making them attractive options for those seeking to secure their financial future.\n\nPlanning for retirement can be daunting, but investing in the right stocks can help ensure financial stability and growth during your golden years. By investing in these strong stocks early on, you can take advantage of their impressive fundamentals and long-term growth prospects. Now, dive in and discover how these three retirement stocks can help make your golden years gleam.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nThe software giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is the first company among today\u2019s retirement stocks. Adobe\u2019s industry-standard design programs, like Photoshop and Acrobat, have been household names for decades. Today, ADBE offers a cloud-based subscription model for its expanding creative, marketing and analytics software range. Such leadership positions it for long-term growth in the digital media landscape.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdobe\u2019s first quarter 2024 earnings report showed total revenues of $5.18 billion, reflecting a year-over-year (YOY) growth of 11%. This increase was primarily driven by the strong performance of its Digital Media and Digital Experience segments. Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $4.48.\n\nRecently, Adobe has announced the integration of Frame.io into Creative Cloud, enhancing video collaboration capabilities. This integration allows users to seamlessly review, share and collaborate on video projects within Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, streamlining workflows and boosting productivity for creative professionals.\n\nDespite these positive developments, ADBE stock is down 20% year-to-date (YTD). Shares are changing hands at 25.8 times forward earnings and 11.1 times sales, reflecting investor confidence in the company\u2019s growth prospects. Analysts also remain optimistic, with a 12-month median price forecast at $640, suggesting a 34% upside potential.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe continue our discussion of retirement stocks with the semiconductor behemoth Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). The company\u2019s products cater to critical functions in communications, networking, industrials, computing, storage and wireless markets.\u00a0 Considering its strong market position, consistent innovation and track record of financial performance, AVGO could be a tech stock to add to retirement portfolios.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom\u2019s growth strategy is heavily anchored in strategic acquisitions that complement and expand its core business segments. The recent acquisition of VMware is a prime example of the significant bolstering of its infrastructure software segment. This acquisition diversifies Broadcom\u2019s revenue streams. It also positions it at the forefront of cloud and enterprise software solutions, sectors to benefit from continued digital transformation trends.\n\nIn March, Broadcom released first quarter 2024 results, announcing revenues of $12 billion, a 34% increase YOY. This growth was partly driven by a 4% increase in semiconductor solutions revenue, which reached $7.4 billion. A staggering 153% increase in infrastructure software revenue, which soared to $4.6 billion, largely due to the integration of VMware, was also helpful.\n\nSince the start of the year, AVGO stock has gained nearly 25% and offers a 1.5% dividend yield. Shares are currently trading at 29 times forward earnings and 15.9 times sales. With a median 12-month price forecast of $1,572, AVGO stock has an upside potential of 13%.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) 2024 Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup truck at the New York Auto Show. GM stock.\n\nSource: quiggyt4 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe conclude our discussion on retirement stocks with the automotive giant General Motors (NYSE:GM). Its diversification efforts, including strategic investments in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous driving technology, highlight GM\u2019s commitment to leading the automotive transformation.\n\nThe automaker reported strong first-quarter fiscal 2024 metrics and raised its full-year guidance. Revenue increased 8% YOY to $43 billion.\u00a0Despite higher interest rates, GM\u2019s sales and pricing contributed to robust profit margins. U.S. retail sales grew 6% without resorting to significant price cuts and incentives. Meanwhile, adjusted EPS jumped 19% YOY to $2.62.\n\nGM\u2019s recent focus on EVs and autonomous vehicles has become a key growth driver, suggesting strong upside potential for its long-term profit prospects. The automaker reported significant progress with its Ultium EV platform. Production increased, and battery costs declined, leading to improved profitability. Meanwhile, the company focuses on connected vehicle software and subscription services to unlock recurring revenue opportunities beyond traditional vehicle sales.\n\nSince January, GM stock has returned 18%. Additionally, it offers a modest 1.1% dividend yield. The company\u2019s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is an attractive 4.9x, and its trailing price-to-sales ratio (P/S) is just 0.3x, presenting a bargain valuation for long-term investors. Finally, analysts have set a 12-month median price forecast of over $51, indicating an upside potential of over 21% from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "7 Penny Stocks That Could Be the Growth Stars of Tomorrow",
        "content": "When I look at penny stocks, there is scope for clear categorization. On one hand, there are penny stocks that are purely speculative in nature. These stocks can be considered for exposure for a few quarters and can skyrocket at the blink of an eye.\n\nOn the other hand, there are penny stocks with potential to rank among high-quality growth stocks of tomorrow. These penny stocks represent emerging businesses that have a sound management, good fundamentals, and a big addressable market for growth.\n\nWhile the meme stock frenzy seems to be knocking at the door, let\u2019s discuss penny stocks that are long term bets. Without doubt, these penny stocks have a high-beta. Further, even a seeming good business can fail as penny stocks represent companies with relatively limited financial buffer. However, if it\u2019s a success story, the returns can be 20x or 50x in the next five to ten years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt therefore makes sense to allocate a small part of the portfolio to these penny stocks with potential.\n\nCronos (CRON) marijuana leaf in green traffic light\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf I had to choose one cannabis stock for the portfolio, it would be Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON). There are several reasons to believe that Cronos has millionaire-maker potential.\n\nThe first point to note is that Cronos commands a market valuation of $1 billion. As of Q1 2024, the Company reported a cash buffer of $855 million. It\u2019s clear that valuations are significantly depressed. With regulatory headwinds for the cannabis industry gradually waning, Cronos has a big addressable market in U.S. and Europe.\n\nI also like the fact that Cronos has been conservative in using its cash buffer. The Company is waiting for the right time and opportunity to go aggressive. However, it\u2019s worth noting that in the last two quarters, Cronos has entered new markets of Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Prior to this, the Company had presence in Canada and Israel.\n\nRevenue for Q1 2024 increased by 30% on a year-on-year basis to $25.3 million. With gradual geographic expansion, the Company is positioning itself for accelerated growth in the coming quarters. The Company further expects net change in cash to be positive for 2024.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe potential success story for Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is purely based on its asset potential. The Company is the owner of the Thacker Pass asset that has an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion. Further, the asset has a mine life of 40 years. Once the both phases of are operational, the asset is likely to deliver an average annual EBITDA of $2 billion. This puts into perspective the extent of undervaluation with Lithium Americas currently having a market valuation of $790 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, production is likely to commence in 2027 and investors need to hold patiently. However, this is the best time to consider exposure with sentiments being excessively negative on the back of lower lithium prices.\n\nI must add here that there have been multiple positive business developments. Last year, General Motors (NYSE:GM) infused $650 million in two tranches for financing the construction. GM also has an offtake agreement for 10 years from the first phase of the project. In March, Lithium Americas received a conditional commitment for a $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. With these positives, it\u2019s a matter of time before LAC stock surges higher.\n\nRing Energy (REI) Oil. 3D Illustration. Oil stocks are up. Penny Oil Stocks\n\nSource: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong emerging oil & gas companies, Ring Energy (NYSE:REI) hold immense potential. Crude oil has been subdued on macroeconomic headwinds and it\u2019s not surprising that REI stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months. In my view, this is a golden opportunity to accumulate for multibagger returns.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Ring Energy currently commands a market valuation of $380 million. In comparison, the PV10 (present value of estimated future oil and gas revenues, net of forecasted direct expenses) of assets is at $1.65 billion. Purely based on asset valuation, REI stock is poised for five-bagger returns from current levels.\n\nAnother important point to note is that between 2018 and 2023, Ring Energy has increased production at a CAGR of 26%. Robust growth has been on the back of multiple acquisitions. The management therefore has a good track record of pursuing inorganic growth. With high financial flexibility, further acquisitions can boost the cash flow potential.\n\nYatra Online (YTRA) Plane travel. Man standing in airport waiting for flight. travel stocks to buy\n\nSource: Olena Yakobchuk / Shutterstock\n\nYatra Online (NASDAQ:YTRA) is a micro-cap that holds immense potential in the long term. As an overview, Yatra is an online travel company in India with services that include air ticketing, hotel booking, holiday packages, among others.\n\nAn important point to note is that Indian travellers will be the fourth largest global spenders by 2030 with expenditure expected to surge to $410 billion. As one of the largest players in the country, Yatra is positioned to benefit.\n\nSpecific to Yatra, there is a key differentiating factor amidst competition. The Company is the largest corporate travel player in India with a customer base of 800 large corporate. Yatra estimates that the addressable employee base is more than seven million. This is a big market for the Company.\n\nAdditionally, Yatra has been making inroads in the consumer business. The Company estimates that the online customer penetration for hotel and air bookings is 38%. Therefore, there is ample headroom for growth in the next five to ten years.\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) Blink Stock Won't Be Able To Hold Its Charge\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInvestment in EV charging infrastructure is the key to potentially higher adoption of EVs in the coming years. Among emerging companies providing EV charging infrastructure, Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) is attractive. After a sustained period of correction, BLNK stock seems to be in a consolidation rage. It\u2019s likely that a breakout will follow considering positive business developments.\n\nThe first point to note is that Blink is on a healthy growth trajectory. For Q1 2024, the Company reported revenue growth of 73% on a year-on-year basis to $37.6 million. With U.S. and Europe as key markets, it\u2019s likely that stellar growth will sustain.\n\nThe second positive is that Blink is moving towards EBITDA break-even. The Company has guided for positive adjusted EBITDA by December. If this is achieved, BLNK stock is likely to surge higher. It\u2019s worth noting that as the number of charging stations installed swells, service revenue growth has been robust. This will support EBITDA margin expansion beyond 2024.\n\nIAMGOLD (IAG) Gold Nugget mining from the River in Austria, real Gold. Gold mining stocks\n\nSource: Aleksandrkozak / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s been a breakout year for gold and I believe that the positive momentum is likely to sustain. The reasons to be bullish include potential rate cuts and high geopolitical tensions globally.\n\nWhile there are some large gold miners that are attractive, IAMGOLD (NYSE:IAG) is an emerging miner with multibagger potential. Even after a 50% rally in the last 12 months, IAG stock trades at a forward P/E of 14.8.\n\nSpecific to the Company, there are multiple reasons to be positive. First, IAMGOLD has high financial flexibility and ended Q1 2024 with a liquidity buffer of $693.8 million. Further, in April, S&P upgraded the corporate credit and senior notes ratings from CCC+ to B- with a stable outlook. I expect continued improvement in credit metrics as higher realized gold price translates into robust cash flows.\n\nIn terms of assets, the Company commenced production in the C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold mine where IAMGOLD has 70% stake. The asset is the third largest gold mine in Canada with a remaining reserves life of 18 years. In the next few years, the asset is likely to deliver healthy production growth. Other attractive assets in the pipeline include Gosselin, Nelligan and Chibougamau district.\n\nSolid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) is another penny stock with potential to be a multibagger. The Company is involved in the commercialization of solid-state batteries. After an extended period of downside, SLDP stock has trended higher by 17% in the last six months. This has been backed by positive news and I expect the rally to sustain.\n\nOne reason to be bullish on Solid Power is the backing of strong partners. In December 2022, the Company licensed its cell design and manufacturing processes to the BMW Group (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) to allow for parallel research and development activities.\n\nFurther, In January, the Company deepened its partnership with SK On, Korea. As a part of the agreement, Solid Power will license its cell designs and production processes to SK On. The advantage of multiple partners with parallel R&D is that the progress towards commercialization can be potentially accelerated.\n\nIn 2023, Solid Power shipped A-1 cells to automotive partners for validation testing. This year, the Company is targeting the shipment of A-2 cells that will address the known challenges in A-1 design. Clearly, business developments have been positive and I am therefore bullish on SLDP stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Jeep revealed new details for its first-ever EV, the upcoming Wagoneer S SUV, on Thursday night. The debut comes as Jeep parent Stellantis (STLA) and Big Three rivals GM and Ford reevaluate their EV game plans.\n\nThe near-production version of the Wagoneer S mimics the popular Jeep Grand Cherokee's clean body lines and front fascia of Jeep\u2019s trademark waterfall grill, but features a lower roofline and sleeker overall shape, which Jeep says is needed for overall aerodynamic efficiency.\n\nUnder the hood, or body in this case, are two electric drive motors (EDMs) that integrate the motor, gearing, and power electronics in one unit. The two motors combine for 600 horsepower and 617 lb-feet of torque, resulting in a 3.4 second 0-60 mph time. The EDMs, along with the 100 kWh battery pack and Jeep-exclusive Selec-Terrain drive modes, give the Wagoneer S 300 miles of range on a full charge. 2024 Jeep Wagoneer S Launch Edition. (Jeep) (Jeep)\n\n\u201cBuilding upon nearly a century of innovation and design, this first global EV will introduce a whole new generation of owners to an experience that is distinctly Jeep and 100% electric in every way,\u201d said Antonio Filosa, Jeep brand CEO, in a statement. \u201cWith new energy in the Jeep vehicle lineup, ranging from EV to V-8, customers have never had more freedom to choose their own adventure.\u201d\n\n-The Wagoneer S will utilize Stellantis\u2019s STLA Large Platform, which is the company\u2019s EV platform for large vehicles. The use of single platforms allows Stellantis to build brand-specific EVs in a cost-effective way. 2024 Jeep Wagoneer S Launch Edition. (Jeep) (Jeep)\n\nCost efficiency is important as the Big Three and rivals like Volkswagen and Toyota blaze their EV paths. GM and Ford have each pushed back on their aggressive EV rollouts in the past quarters, and even Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said the company will slow down or ramp up production of EVs depending on consumer demand.\n\nTavares also told Yahoo Finance in February that the company is fully invested for its EV buildout through 2027, and can wait until the end of this year to determine further investments for the 2028 - 2035 timeline, indicating the company has flexibility in making its large cap-ex commitments. 2024 Jeep Wagoneer S Launch Edition (Jeep)\n\nWhile the Jeep brand in particular is thriving, with strong sales of its plug-in hybrid 4xe Jeep Wrangler and Grand Cherokee vehicles, the company and CEO Carlos Tavares still believes EVs are the future for some buyers.\n\nTavares said yesterday at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference that the company would release a $25,000 Jeep EV in the US \u201cvery soon,\u201d and has said the cheap Citroen EV that was released in Europe is already being made at a profit.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for the US and the just-debuted Wagoneer S, Jeep said high-spec Launch Edition models would start at $71,995, including destination, a bit below the $80,000 some expected. Jeep did not reveal what lower-spec versions of the Wagoneer would retail for at dealers. 2024 Jeep Wagoneer S Launch Edition Radar Red Interior.

        "title": "We Think Some Shareholders May Hesitate To Increase General Motors Company's (NYSE:GM) CEO Compensation",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGeneral Motors will host its Annual General Meeting on 4th of June Salary of US$2.10m is part of CEO Mary Barra's total remuneration The total compensation is 94% higher than the average for the industry Over the past three years, General Motors' EPS grew by 14%  and over the past three years, the total loss to shareholders 27%\n\nIn the past three years, the share price of General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) has struggled to grow and now shareholders are sitting on a loss. What is concerning is that despite positive EPS growth, the share price has not tracked the trend in fundamentals. The AGM coming up on the 4th of June could be an opportunity for shareholders to bring these concerns to the board's attention. They could also try to influence management and firm direction through voting on resolutions such as executive remuneration and other company matters. We discuss below why we think shareholders should be cautious of approving a raise for the CEO at the moment.\n\nView our latest analysis for General Motors\n\nComparing General Motors Company's CEO Compensation With The Industry\n\nOur data indicates that General Motors Company has a market capitalization of US$49b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$28m for the year to December 2023. That's a slight decrease of 3.9% on the prior year. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at US$2.1m.\n\nIn comparison with other companies in the American Auto industry with market capitalizations over US$8.0b, the reported median total CEO compensation was US$14m. Accordingly, our analysis reveals that General Motors Company pays Mary Barra north of the industry median. Furthermore, Mary Barra directly owns US$81m worth of shares in the company, implying that they are deeply invested in the company's success.\n\nComponent 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary US$2.1m US$2.1m 8% Other US$26m US$27m 92% Total Compensation US$28m US$29m 100%\n\nTalking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 16% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 84% of the pie. In General Motors' case, non-salary compensation represents a greater slice of total remuneration, in comparison to the broader industry. If non-salary compensation dominates total pay, it's an indicator that the executive's salary is tied to company performance. ceo-compensation\n\nA Look at General Motors Company's Growth Numbers\n\nGeneral Motors Company's earnings per share (EPS) grew 14% per year over the last three years. It achieved revenue growth of 8.8% over the last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis demonstrates that the company has been improving recently and is good news for the shareholders. It's also good to see modest revenue growth, suggesting the underlying business is healthy. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future.\n\nHas General Motors Company Been A Good Investment?\n\nSince shareholders would have lost about 27% over three years, some General Motors Company investors would surely be feeling negative emotions. So shareholders would probably want the company to be less generous with CEO compensation.\n\nIn Summary...\n\nShareholders have not seen their shares grow in value, rather they have seen their shares decline. A huge lag in share price growth when earnings have grown may indicate there could be other issues that are affecting the company at the moment that the market is focused on. Shareholders would probably be keen to find out what are the other factors could be weighing down the stock. These concerns should be addressed at the upcoming AGM, where shareholders can question the board and evaluate if their judgement and decision making is still in line with their expectations.\n\nCEO compensation is an important area to keep your eyes on, but we've also need to pay attention to other attributes of the company. In our study, we found 3 warning signs for General Motors you should be aware of, and 2 of them don't sit too well with us.\n\nSwitching gears from General Motors, if you're hunting for a pristine balance sheet and premium returns, this freelist of high return, low debt companies is a great place to look.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "NIO Stock\u2019s Battery Swapping Bet: A Gamble That Might Not Pay Off for Investors",
        "content": "Two key attributes that I often look for in companies when deciding whether to invest in them are points of differentiation and competitive advantages. Points of differentiation distinguish companies from their competitors. Some of these points result in competitive advantages that enable firms to gain market share. Ultimately, market share gains frequently result in higher profits. Finally, stock prices usually rise because of higher profits.\n\nBoth Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) made products that consumers viewed as much more attractive than those of their competitors. That was their main point of differentiation. It became a huge competitive advantage for both of them, enabling them to gain market share and tremendously boost their profits.\n\nWhile Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio (NASDAQ:NIO) has its own key point of differentiation, the evidence suggests it\u2019s not yet a competitive advantage for the firm. I\u2019m unsure if that situation will change in the future. Moreover, Nio is facing very stiff competition and its recent growth metrics have been quite unimpressive.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGiven these points, I recommend investors sell NIO stock.\n\nNio\u2019s Key Point of Differentiation\n\nNio\u2019s key point 0f differentiation is its extensive battery-swapping network. With battery swapping, EV drivers can exchange their used batteries for new, full batteries at specified locations.\n\nI\u2019ve always believed that battery swapping would make driving EVs much more attractive for consumers. That\u2019s because, in a short period of time (three minutes, according to Nio), battery swapping would allow EV drivers to go from having very little driving range to having hundreds of miles available again. As a result, the system, if implemented on a broad scale, could largely eliminate both the \u201crange anxiety\u201d issue and the need to wait a long time before EVs are mostly or fully charged.\n\nBut history strongly suggests that my faith in the power of battery swapping was misplaced. Nio said in March that it had carried out 40 million battery swaps yet the firm is still losing a great deal of money. It is also far from being one of China\u2019s leading EV makers. For example, the automaker handed over slightly more than 160,000 vehicles in 2023, while its rival BYD (OTC:BYDDF) delivered a bit more than 3 million vehicles last year. What\u2019s more, Nio lost nearly $2.8 billion last year.\n\nMoreover, an Israeli startup called Better Space focused on battery swapping about 10 years ago and suffered \u201cmassive losses.\u201d It eventually disappeared.\n\nStory continues\n\nCould Battery Swapping Eventually Be a Competitive Advantage for NIO Stock?\n\nIn November 2023, Nio began partnering with several other Chinese automakers on \u201cdeveloping battery swap standards and expanding the network in China,\u201d CNBC reported.\n\nBy working with other automakers, Nio will be able to foster the creation of a huge battery-swapping ecosystem and spread the word about the service more effectively. On the other hand, if more automakers offer the service, Nio\u2019s point of differentiation and competitive advantage become greatly diluted.\n\nFurther, automakers and battery makers are developing EV batteries that can be charged relatively quickly. For example, Tesla\u2019s superchargers allow 200 miles of range to be added to vehicles\u2019 batteries in just 15 minutes. And Israeli startup StoreDotsays that the range of its batteries can be increased by 70 percentage points in only 10 minutes.\n\nOver the longer term, these and other advances in EV batteries may make battery-swapping services less attractive.\n\nNio\u2019s Tough Competition and Unimpressive Growth\n\nNio is facing an array of very tough competitors in the Chinese EV market. In addition to Tesla and BYD, Nio has to contend with many Western giants whose vehicles are generally very popular in the Asian country. Among the names in the latter category are General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (OTC:VLKAF).\n\nAnd there are indications that Nio is faltering amid the tough conditions. For example, in Q4 of 2023, its revenue from EV sales increased just 4.6% versus the same period a year earlier. Its operating loss only fell by 4% during the quarter versus the same period a year earlier to a very steep $933 million.\n\nThe Bottom Line on NIO Stock\n\nNIO stock has a low price-to-sales ratio of one. Still, given the uncertain value of the company\u2019s only apparent point of differentiation and its uninspiring growth. I advise investors to sell the shares at this time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "The Least Feminist Country in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we take a look at theleast feminist country in the world. If you wish to see our full list, please switch over to 20 Least Feminist Countries in the World.\n\nA Historic Milestone\n\nOn June 2nd, Mexico is set to witness what The New York Times Company (NYSE: NYT) describes as a landmark election. It is expected to be the largest election in the nation\u2019s history, with an anticipated turnout of approximately 99 million voters, per The New York Times Company (NYSE: NYT). However, what makes the election truly unprecedented is that Mexico is on the brink of electing its first-ever female president. According to The New York Times Company (NYSE: NYT), both front runners in the election campaign are women, namely Claudia Sheinbaum and X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez. The imminent election of a female president in Mexico isn\u2019t an isolated event. Rather, it is part of a much larger global effort to not only challenge gender-based social and cultural inequities but also ensure that women can play a critical role in driving political and economic success.\n\nWomen-led Businesses\n\nPolitics isn\u2019t the only area where women have managed to secure high-level positions. Just a few years ago, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) appointed Jane Fraser as its CEO, marking it as the first time ever that a major Wall Street bank was led by a woman. Currently, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) is one of the notable names, alongside General Motor Company (NYSE: GM), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL), that have women in chief executive roles. However, appointing female CEOs isn\u2019t a symbolic gesture to gain social capital. In fact, a recent study by Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) showcases how impactful female business owners have been in growing their businesses since the pandemic. According to Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC), from 2019 to 2023, women-owned businesses\u2019 growth rate outpaced the rate of men\u2019s 94.3% for number of firms, 252.8% for employment, and 82.0% for revenue. The Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) Impact of Women-Owned Business Report 2024 also revealed that during the pandemic, women-owned businesses added 1.4 million jobs and $579.6 billion in revenue to the US economy. However, like almost every other facet of life, despite their significant contributions to the global economy, women continue to be subjected to inequitable working conditions.\n\nGender Inequality\n\nAccording to the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC), 51% of peri and post-menopausal women report menopause negatively impacted their work life. Yet, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC) reports that only 14% of these women believe their employers recognize the need for menopause-specific benefits. Moreover, other than a select few nations in the world, most nations, including the US, have no state or federal-level policies to mandate menstrual leaves. Apart from a lack of mindfulness of women-centric challenges, many other biases result in women being financially exploited. A government survey on gender pay gaps in Australia showed that the average gender pay gap of surveyed companies was 19%. This gap was even more significant in firms such as Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC), where the gap was 48% and 42% respectively. Similarly, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) had a gap of 29%, although the company maintained that this gap was due to a higher proportion of men in senior roles.\n\nAlthough several nations have managed to overcome gender inequality to a significant extent, women in most countries continue to suffer at the hands of social and cultural stigmas. This is particularly evident in the developing world, where many countries have poor gender equality and gender pay gaps are often substantially higher than the global average. A study on gender equality in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2023 revealed that women earn 40 to 46 percent less than men in urban areas. United Nations\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals Report 2023 revealed that women held only 28% of management positions globally in 2021. Despite it already being poor, the situation in Northern Africa, Western Asia, and Central & South Asia is even worse, with a figure of just 15%. This is despite the fact that gender equality is considered to be one of the most important factors in alleviating poverty. In fact, Moody\u2019s Analytics, a subsidiary of Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) claims that the global economy is losing out on at least $7 trillion of economic gains each year due to a failure to reach gender parity in the workforce.\n\nWith these factors considered, if you\u2019re wondering which country has the worst gender pay gap or where is gender inequality most common in the world, join us as we look at the least feminist countries in the world.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo develop our list of least feminist countries in the world, we utilized 4 different datasets. These included UNDP\u2019s GENDER INEQUALITY INDEX (GII), World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), UN Women\u2019s Women Empowerment Index, and Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security\u2019s (GIWPS) Women Peace and Security Index. Using data from all 4 sources, we calculated an aggregate score for each country. The list was sorted in descending order, with the top 20 items being selected as the least feminist countries in the world.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\n\nOur methodology revealed that Yemen is theleast feminist country in the world.\n\n1. Yemen\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 4.00\n\nYemen is currently experiencing one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, with 17.6 million people facing food & nutrition insecurity and 4.5 million people currently being displaced. According to UNWFP, in January 2024, 52% of the surveyed households in Yemen were unable to access adequate food. As with other cases of political conflicts, the current situation in Yemen has exacerbated gender disparities.\n\nOver 30 percent of Yemeni girls are married before the age of 18, often because families fail to meet basic needs such as putting food on the table, instead marrying their daughters in the hopes of offering them a better life whilst also alleviating their own financial hardships. For years, authorities have also implemented strict restrictions on travel, requiring women to be accompanied by male guardians when traveling.\n\nConsequently, women experiencing domestic abuse cannot leave their homes without their husband\u2019s permission and can even be disciplined by their partners to ensure they comply. Those managing to escape the vicinity of their homes aren\u2019t better off either. According to a report on gender-based violence in Yemen, during the first 7 months of 2022, Houthi forces abducted over 100 girls on false prostitution charges, subjecting them to virginity tests and assaulting them while in custody.\n\nAlthough Yemen is the least feminist country in the world, our list reveals that in terms of sexual violence and discriminatory legal frameworks, some countries might actually be worse.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in finding out which other countries in the world rank worst in terms of gender equality, check out our free-full list of 20 Least Feminist Countries in the World.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the most and least feminist countries in the world to retirement and investment strategies; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "content": "At first glance, sustainable stocks to buy sounds like a nice concept but that ultimately won\u2019t make you money. If we look at capitalism in the most cynical sense, the ethos strives to maximize profitability while minimizing costs. And it costs money to be sustainable.\n\nHowever, that may be a poor way of framing the topic. Yes, cutting corners in practices and ethics can yield greater revenue and profitability. However, that\u2019s in the short term. Over the long run, unsustainable practices are, well, unsustainable. Stated differently, going about business in a shady way merely delays inevitable ruin.\n\nPlus, the emerging generation of consumers care deeply about holistic practices. Ignoring this trend can be detrimental to the bottom line. On that note, below are sustainable stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nKellanova (K) a delivery man in a red shirt dropping off a bag of groceries to represent food and beverage stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Chicago, Illinois, Kellanova (NYSE:K) falls under the consumer defensive category, specifically packaged goods. Along with its subsidiaries, Kellanova manufactures and markets snacks and convenience foods. As it relates to sustainable stocks to buy, the company features its MorningStar Farms brand, which focuses on plant-based meat.\n\nOn the plus side, Kellanova is financially consistent. Between the second quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 15.23%. However, the not-so-pleasant side is that analysts anticipate a top-line erosion. For fiscal 2024, revenue may drop down to $12.67 billion, 3.5% below last year\u2019s print of $13.12 billion.\n\nAssuming a shares outstanding count of 341.88 million, K stock is currently trading at roughly 1.61X projected revenue. That\u2019s a bit hot compared to the 1.5X average over the past five quarters. However, if shares fall down to around $50, the sales multiple would reach approximately 1.35X. That would be a more comfortable entry point. Judging by recent volatility, that price point is a real possibility.\n\nBloom Energy (BE) BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nHeadquartered in San Jose, California, Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) works in the industrial segment, specifically in electrical equipment and parts. Per its public profile, Bloom designs, manufactures, sells and installs solid-oxide fuel cell systems for on-site power generation in the U.S. and international markets. BE ranks among the sustainable stocks to buy because it converts fuels such as natural gas into electricity without combustion.\n\nFinancially, the company is admittedly hit or miss. Yes, technically speaking, its average quarterly surprise comes out to 92.7%. However, Bloom badly missed the mark in Q2 and Q4 last year and Q1 this year. However, in Q3, it posted earnings per share of 15 cents when experts anticipated a loss of 4 cents.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the trailing 12 months (TTM), Bloom incurred a net loss of $288.07 million on revenue of $1.29 billion. However, for fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate EPS to hit 10 cents, a big improvement over last year\u2019s loss of 10 cents. Revenue could also expand 9.8% to hit $1.46 billion.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to sustainable stocks to buy, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) needs no introduction to those in the know. However, to recap for everyone, the company falls under the regulated electric utilities space. Per its corporate profile, NextEra generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric power to retail and wholesale customers in North America. It features a vast portfolio, including wind, solar and battery storage projects.\n\nFinancially, the benefit of owning NEE stock centers on the underlying consistency. Between Q2 2023 to Q1 2024, NextEra\u2019s average positive earnings surprise comes out to 9.53%. Over the TTM period, the company generated net income of $7.49 billion on sales of $27.13 billion. This print enables the utility to deliver a forward dividend yield of 2.69%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts anticipate that EPS will hit $3.40. That\u2019s a decent improvement from last year\u2019s result of $3.17. However, the consensus revenue target calls for $27.39 billion, which represents a 2.6% decline. Still, the high-side target is aiming for $32.68 billion, which could be realistic given the broader interest in sustainability.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a software and technology giant, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) really needs no introduction, period. Chances are, you\u2019re using one of its business software to execute various functions. Or you could be playing video games via its popular Xbox console. However, MSFT is also one of the sustainable stocks to buy thanks to its core ethos. Microsoft broadcasted aggressive sustainability targets, including being carbon negative by 2030.\n\nOf course, the added bonus for owning MSFT beyond the holistic angle is the robust financial performance. In the past four quarters, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 7%. During the TTM period, net income clocked in at $86.18 billion on revenue of $236.58 billion. Presently, the company\u2019s quarterly revenue growth (year-over-year) stands at 17%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts forecast EPS to hit $11.79. That\u2019s a massive leap forward from last year\u2019s print of $9.81. On the top line, Microsoft could reach $244.92 billion. If so, that would represent a 15.6% gain from 2023\u2019s tally of $211.91 billion.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt first glance, putting legacy automakers like General Motors (NYSE:GM) in a list of sustainable stocks to buy seems odd. After all, the sector has been responsible for a large portion of carbon emissions. However, GM is taking a major step forward in being environmentally responsible. In addition to its pivot to new-generation vehicles, it\u2019s targeting the elimination of tailpipe emissions (from new light-duty vehicles) by 2035.\n\nIn addition, the company aims to be carbon-neutral in its products and operations by 2040. Financially, the focus on holistic efforts hasn\u2019t impeded its progress. In the past four quarters since Q1, GM\u2019s average quarterly earnings surprise clocked in at just under 14%. Over the TTM period, the automaker posted a net income of $10.62 billion on sales of $174.87 billion.\n\nLooking out to the end of fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate EPS to expand by 24.6% to hit $9.57. On the top line, sales could land at $175.98 billion, a modest increase from last year\u2019s $171.84 billion. The company also offers a forward dividend yield of 1.09%, helping to pad the narrative.\n\nelf Beauty (ELF) a collection of various cosmetic products on a black table\n\nSource: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile a cosmetics enterprise might not be the first idea for sustainable stocks to buy, elf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) aims to change perceptions. Together with its subsidiaries, elf is mainly known for its mineral-based makeup and professional tools. Fundamentally, the business has resonated with its core young consumers thanks to its focus on cruelty-free products.\n\nWith consumers increasingly voting their conscience with their wallets, elf is making a smart move. As its recent earnings report demonstrated, the prioritization in sustainability hasn\u2019t hurt the business. In fact, it\u2019s probably helped. Over the past four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise came out to nearly 63%. In the TTM period, net income reached $127.66 million on sales of $1.02 billion.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, covering experts are seeking EPS of $3.41, a 7.2% increase from last year\u2019s print of $3.18. On the top line, sales could reach $1.28 billion, up 25% from fiscal 2024. Although ELF stock trades at a hot premium of 10.8X, it\u2019s trading at 8.44X forward revenue. Stated differently, it could grow into its valuation.\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH) Smartphone with logo of American company company Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) on screen in front of business website. Focus on left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nA relevant idea for sustainable stocks to buy, Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) is also one of the riskiest. Over the past 52 weeks, ENPH lost almost 26% of equity value. Since the start of the year, shares are underwater by more than 1%. That\u2019s very disappointing but the issue is that the solar technology specialist is struggling amid broader economic concerns.\n\nAnalysts are overall bullish on ENPH stock, rating it a consensus moderate buy. That\u2019s great but the problem is that the average price target sits at $125, implying more than 3% downside risk. On the plus side, the most optimistic target calls for $165 per share. It\u2019s a mixed bag financially. While the average quarterly surprise is 1.63%, Enphase missed its bottom-line target in Q4 and Q1.\n\nThe ambiguity is reflected in the forecast for the current fiscal year. Analysts anticipate EPS to drop to $2.85, down 35.3% from last year. Also, revenue might only reach $1.47 billion, down almost 36%. However, the blue-sky sales target stands at $1.54 billion. And next year, the high-side view runs up to sales of $2.55 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s a risk but speculators should keep it on their radar.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Hyundai Continues To Expand Its EV Lineup\n\nWhile legacy automakers General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F) continue to scale down and reassess their EV ambitions, Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF) is growing its EV portfolio. After setting a strong foundation with its current EV success in the U.S. with IONIQ 5, IONIQ 6 and Kona Electric, Hyundai\u00a0will be introducing a three-row electric SUV, the IONIQ 9.\n\nWhile even the EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) kicked off 2024 by struggling with the slowdown, Hyundai has been enjoying increased interest in its EV offerings. During the first quarter, Hyundai reported that its EV sales surged as much as\u00a062% due to record performances of the IONIQ 5 and Kona Electric.\n\nThe IONIQ 9 Promises To Cement Hyundais\u2019 EV Positioning\n\nThe Hyundai IONIQ 9 will be Hyundai\u2019s first three-row electric SUV. Therefore, it will compete with three row electric SUVs from Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ: RIVN), namely the Rivian R1S, as well as Kia Ev9 and Volvo EX90. With the pitch of the IONIQ 9, Hyundai aims to cement its status as a leading provider of affordable and efficient EVs. Moreover, its vehicles will also be enhanced by the world\u2019s first solar-tonneau cover thanks to its signed agreement with\u00a0Worksport Ltd. (NASDAQ: WKSP). Hyundai was the first to express interest in Worksport\u2019s revolutionary power duo, the SOLIS solar tonneau cover and the COR portable battery system, whose alpha versions are expected to hit the market this summer.\n\nWorksport Has Been Issued A\u00a0New U.S. Patent For Its Innovative Solar Truck Cover\n\nWorksport enlarged its already impressive intellectual property portfolio as the United States Patent & Trademark Office\u00a0issued new utility patent for its\u00a0SOLIS solar-powered tonneau cover.\u00a0Worksport is bringing the world\u2019s first solar-powered tonneau truck that promise to disrupt the market which sells about 7 million truck bed covers per year. Earlier this year, Worksport SOLIS cover will be made compatible with the top three selling vehicles in the U.S., namely Ford F-Series, Chevrolet Silverado, and Ram pickup trucks, along with other major brands. Hyundai signed an agreement back in 2022 to ensure it gains access to both SOLIS and COR to empower its pickups. This innovative product, as part of the power duo together with COR portable battery system, will enable Worksport to target both combustion engine pickups, along with OEM integration for upcoming electric pickup trucks, extending their range.\n\nAlong with Ford and GM, even Tesla took a step back. Tesla and Rivian kicked off the year with layoffs. But part of the problem even for Tesla was the lack of new products, with its Model 3 and Model Y being old news, despite the revamping of the Model 3, and the eye-catching Cybertruck not being a mainstream product. Hyundai certainly does not have that problem as it showed its determination to stick to its EV rollout and growth plans.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Insight into Nygren's Latest Portfolio Adjustments and Key Financial Decisions\n\nBill Nygren (Trades, Portfolio), a seasoned portfolio manager at The Oakmark Fund, The Oakmark Select Fund, and the Oakmark Global Select Fund, has recently disclosed his investment activities for the first quarter of 2024. With a Masters in Finance from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a B.S. in Accounting from the University of Minnesota, Nygren is a committed value investor. His strategy focuses on acquiring stakes in undervalued companies where he perceives a significant gap between the market price and the intrinsic business value. His investment decisions are guided by a thorough analysis of a companys stock price, free cash flows, and management effectiveness. Bill Nygren's Strategic Moves in Q1 2024 Highlight Deere & Co's Prominent Position\n\nSummary of New Buys\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, Bill Nygren (Trades, Portfolio) expanded his portfolio by adding three new stocks:\n\nDeere & Co (NYSE:DE) was the standout addition with 1,326,293 shares, making up 2.66% of the portfolio and valued at $544.76 million.

        "title": "What Elon Musk should tell Donald Trump",
        "content": "Donald Trump is a petrolhead. The former president gushes over fossil fuels and rails against alternative energy. Trump has pledged to limit or even stop sales of electric vehicles if elected to a second term in this year\u2019s presidential race, as if he can turn the clock back a decade or two.\n\nA possible new Trump adviser \u2014 Tesla CEO Elon Musk \u2014 could help Trump freshen his thinking. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the two men have established a sort of alliance, with Musk possibly taking an advisory role in a second Trump administration if Trump wins this year\u2019s presidential race. Musk is a polymath, and the Journal suggested he could offer Trump ideas on border security and data analysis. But Musk could certainly correct some of Trump\u2019s misunderstandings on EVs as well.\n\nMusk and other automaker CEOs might applaud Trump\u2019s deregulatory plans, but none of them is pulling for Trump to kill the EV. Carmakers have already spent billions developing EV technology, with another $1 trillion or so in planned investment through 2030. That\u2019s a massive amount of spending meant to transform and modernize one of the world\u2019s biggest industries.\n\nThe pace of EV sales has slowed recently, but that doesn\u2019t mean the technology is a passing fad. EVs are still more expensive than traditional gas-powered models, and range limitations still scare off buyers who don\u2019t live near robust charging networks. EVs are still in their early days, and there are likely to be breakthroughs that lower cost, extend range, and make EVs appealing to a much broader set of drivers.\n\nThere\u2019s sinister political logic behind Trump\u2019s crusade against EVs. Trump has reportedly made a bald pitch to fossil fuel executives, asking them to raise $1 billion for his 2024 campaign in exchange for carbon-friendly policies during a second Trump presidency. The assumption is that limiting EV sales will cause Americans to buy more gasoline and benefit fossil fuel drillers, who in theory would sell more product.\n\nBut that\u2019s a narrow, America-only view that doesn\u2019t account for what\u2019s happening in the rest of the world. Climate change and global warming are forcing decarbonization everywhere, and the big US companies Trump seeks the favor of don\u2019t just operate in the United States.\n\nExxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and the like must orient their businesses toward what\u2019s happening everywhere, not what one particular American president might prefer. Same for all the big automakers. While these corporate giants want to milk as much profit from legacy businesses as they can, they also want to cash in on future opportunities such as carbon capture, EV mineral mining, and whatever fuels vehicles 50 years from now.\n\nStory continues Elon Musk, left center, and Wendell P. Weeks, right center, listen to then-President Donald Trump, right, as he meets with business leaders at the White House on Monday, Jan. 23, 2017, in Washington, D.C. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nFossil fuels are going to be around for a long time, but they serve industries of the past. EVs and renewable energy are industries of the future, with fortunes to be made by businesses that make the right bets. They\u2019re among the 10 industries China considers pillars of national strength, worthy of special treatment. And China leads, for now, in the development of affordable EVs.\n\nThe mercurial Musk actually supported Biden and his green energy agenda when Biden took office in 2021. But as Biden began to promote EVs, he often excluded Tesla, a non-unionized automaker, instead hyping General Motors and Ford, which are unionized but far behind Tesla in EV technology.\n\nMusk grew irritated, and lately he has become a prominent Biden critic. In an April tweet, he described Biden as \u201ca tragic front for a far left political machine.\u201d\n\nMusk could tell Trump a few things about EVs and green energy. First, while the United States is the biggest market for Tesla\u2019s electric cars, China is second and Europe is third. Overseas markets are crucial to developing the scale needed to get and stay profitable. Trump could change the rules in the United States to favor more gas burning, but other markets would continue to press for greater EV adoption to meet their own pollution and emission targets. It would disadvantage some US firms to establish US standards far out of sync with those elsewhere.\n\nSecond, virtually nobody ever bought a Tesla because the government made them do it. Teslas are premium cars buyers pay up for because they want to own one. EVs have appeal beyond their eco-friendliness.\n\nFinally, investors have rewarded Tesla for its leadership role in an industry of the future by bidding the stock sky-high and making Tesla one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. Tesla has benefited from government subsidies meant to speed the adoption of EVs, but it also did fine when those subsidies expired for Tesla and other automakers hitting certain sales targets. Tesla is a market success, not a government lapdog.\n\nBiden, for his part, has a different angle on the politics of automaking. He signed into law huge incentives for green energy production, with some of them contingent on hiring unionized workers. He sided with striking automakers last year and showed up at a Michigan picket line. Most recently, he imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese-made EVs, which is meant largely to keep them out of the US market completely and protect American jobs.\n\nBoth Trump and Biden know they need to win the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin to take this year\u2019s presidential prize. The battle over EVs is really a fight for blue-collar votes in battleground states. Someday, however, your EV won\u2019t be a political statement, but just a car.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Everyone loves discounts and that\u2019s essentially what value stocks to buy represent. The difference, though, between a value play and a \u201ccheap\u201d security comes down to the credibility (or lack thereof) of the underlying narrative.\n\nA cheap stock is akin to browsing for apparel at the discount rack. You find the attire that you\u2019re looking for but it\u2019s either sized for kids or for NBA centers. On the other hand, a value stock is finding appropriately sized clothing but for the \u201cwrong\u201d season.\n\nHowever, you decide to pick it up because you know that the season (whatever it is) will eventually come up. That\u2019s the framework behind these value stocks to\u00a0 buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the biggest automotive manufacturers in the world, General Motors (NYSE:GM) needs no introduction. However, the narrative for GM has been taking a hit in recent years due to the rise of electric vehicles. Still, legacy automakers may be getting a reprieve. EV sales are falling while demand for hybrids is soaring. That presents an opportunity for General Motors, in part because pure-play EV manufacturers can\u2019t respond.\n\nJust as well, GM has the option of pivoting back to EVs once the sector heats up again. So, it makes for a solid case for value stocks to buy. Between the second quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, the automaker posted a positive earnings surprise of nearly 14%. In the trailing 12 months (TTM), GM posted net income of $10.62 billion on revenue of $174.87 billion.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts anticipate earnings per share to hit $9.60. If so, that would represent a 25% increase in the bottom line. In addition, fiscal 2025 EPS could improve to $9.70. During this time, experts believe sales will also expand modestly. Combined with a very modest trailing-year earnings multiple of 5.39X, GM makes a good case for value stocks to buy.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother enterprise that needs no introduction, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a technology powerhouse. However, the company has been overshadowed by its competitors, especially with semiconductor firms banking on the generative artificial intelligence wave. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean that Intel is irrelevant. It has its work cut out for it but it still commands acumen in advanced fields like system on chips (SoCs).\n\nTo be fair, analysts aren\u2019t giving INTC stock much of a sense, rating shares a consensus hold. Nevertheless, the average price target stands at $37.87, implying over 23% upside potential. Intel has strong support among its core believers in part because of its earnings performance. Indeed, the average positive surprise came out to 166.73% in the past four quarters since Q1 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the TTM period, Intel posted net income $4.07 billion on revenue of $55.24 billion. For fiscal 2024, experts believe that EPS will rise to $1.09, implying 3.8% growth. That doesn\u2019t sound like much. However, in fiscal 2025, EPS could soar to $1.95. Also, sales could expand by 12.4% to hit $62.69 billion. If you can take some risk, INTC could be an intriguing idea for value stocks to buy.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo be sure, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is a tricky name. Let\u2019s face it, there are few sectors that command sustained relevance like healthcare. Further, Pfizer is a massive business and it received a tremendous boost during the Covid-19 years thanks to its vaccine. With fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus fading, though, PFE stock has indeed suffered a relevancy problem.\n\nOver the past 52 weeks, shares have slipped 22%. They also lost almost 27% of their value in the past five years. That means Pfizer suffered an implosion after performing so well during the early Covid years. Still, analysts rate PFE a consensus moderate buy with a high-side price target of $45. That may be because of its strong earnings performance. In the past four quarters since Q1, Pfizer\u2019s earnings surprise clocked in at 67.68%.\n\nIn the TTM period, the company did suffer a loss of $288 million on revenue of $54.89 billion. That\u2019s not great. However, for fiscal 2024, experts see EPS expanding by nearly 28% to hit $2.35. By fiscal 2025, the metric could reach $2.73 per share. During this time, revenue may rise by an average of 3.5%. Combined with a forward yield of 5.82%, PFE is one of the value stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "General Motors (GM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this an automotive manufacturer have returned -4.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors falls in, has gained 4.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, General Motors is expected to post earnings of $2.59 per share, indicating a change of +35.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $9.40 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +22.4%. This estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.51 indicates a change of +1.2% from what General Motors is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor General Motors, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $44.94 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $174.72 billion and $175.39 billion estimates indicate +1.7% and +0.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGeneral Motors reported revenues of $43.01 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.6%. EPS of $2.62 for the same period compares with $2.21 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.29 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.18%. The EPS surprise was +25.96%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGeneral Motors is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Slowdown\u00a0in US Electric Vehicle Sales Looks More Like a Blip",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- After an underwhelming start to the year for US electric-vehicle sales, it might seem easy to conclude that the boom times are over. Sales were flat in the first quarter, Ford dramatically scaled back expansion plans and Tesla laid off 10% of its global workforce. But these dismal indicators only tell part of the story.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWall Street Moves to Fastest Settlement of Trades in a Century Israeli Airstrike and Egyptian Guard\u2019s Death Ratchet Up Tensions Catering to the Ultra-Rich Is a Booming Business in Australia For Private Credit's Top Talent, $1 Million a Year Is Not Enough Stocks Trade Mixed With Focus on Inflation Data: Markets Wrap\n\nFor every sign of an EV slowdown, another suggests an adolescent industry on the verge of its next growth spurt. In fact, for most automakers, even the first quarter was a blockbuster. Six of the 10 biggest EV makers in the US saw sales grow at a scorching pace compared to a year ago \u2014 up anywhere from 56% at Hyundai-Kia to 86% at Ford. A sampling of April sales similarly came in hot.\n\nIt\u2019s a tale of two EV markets, where consumers are flocking to some brands in record numbers while turning their backs on those with inferior battery range, slower charging and high prices, said Stephanie Valdez-Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. Delays of new vehicles, though temporary, added to the perception of a market running out of steam.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing growth in demand, just not at the same pace for every brand,\u201d Valdez-Streaty said. \u201cRight now Tesla doesn\u2019t have new models, Ford doesn\u2019t have a lot in the pipeline. But Hyundai, BMW, Kia, Cadillac \u2014 they\u2019re really moving the needle forward.\u201d\n\nGM sees 300% growth for 2024\n\nThe two companies with the worst start to the year were General Motors and Tesla \u2014 both victims, in part, of their own product cycles. This year GM discontinued its most popular EV, the Chevy Bolt, before its replacements were ready, while Tesla Model 3 production was interrupted for a long-planned facelift to the car\u2019s design. Excluding those two models, US EV sales in the first quarter grew a respectable 23% over a year ago, matching pace with global EV sales for the same period.\n\nFor the rest of 2024, GM appears to be on the brink of becoming the biggest driver of EV growth in the US. The Detroit automaker has committed to electrifying some of its biggest brands, which are finally reaching production after years of delays. That includes a $35,000 Equinox SUV and its sibling Blazer, as well as Silverado and GMC Sierra electric pickups with up to 450 miles of range.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese vehicles all rely on the new Ultium line of batteries from GM\u2019s joint venture with LG Chem. Problems with those batteries, and with GM\u2019s new EV software, tripped the brakes on the automaker\u2019s EV plans last year. Had Ultium arrived on time, in the numbers GM had predicted, the mood around the US EV market might have been exuberant going into 2024.\n\nGM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra says Ultium problems are in the rearview, and the company expects to produce 200,000 to 300,000 Ultium-based EVs this year, a potential 50-fold increase from the 5,800 Cadillac Lyrics sold in Q1. \u201cI think it was overhyped and now it\u2019s probably underhyped,\u201d Barra recently said of the US outlook for EVs. \u201cThe truth is somewhere in the middle.\u201d\n\nAnd for all the talk of an EV slowdown, many longer-term forecasts haven\u2019t budged. In April, the International Energy Agency estimated that US sales of fully electric vehicles will soar to 2.5 million in 2025, from 1.1 million last year.\n\nThe biggest source of uncertainty for the US outlook is the product pipeline at Tesla, which is responsible for half of the country\u2019s EV market. Tesla relies on just two cars \u2014 the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV \u2014 for 95% of its sales. It repeatedly slashed prices last year to maintain growth before its first-quarter slump.\n\nTesla\u2019s calendar of new-vehicle launches is essentially blank, apart from an aspirational Roadster supercar and a vague hint by Elon Musk last month of \u201cnew vehicles, including more affordable models,\u201d coming next year. It\u2019s too soon to gauge long-term demand for Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck pickup, which is currently only offered as a $120,000 founders edition.\n\nIn August, Tesla plans to unveil a self-driving \u201cCybercab\u201d without a steering wheel. There\u2019s plenty of uncertainty about the readiness of the underlying technology and about what will propel Tesla sales growth until it\u2019s ready. Adding to the uncertainty is the state of Tesla\u2019s high-speed Superchargers in the US. The company recently opened its network of more than 2,000 US charging stations to non-Tesla owners, who can access the chargers with an adaptor. But in the middle of that transition, Musk fired Tesla\u2019s 500-person Supercharger staff as part of the company-wide layoffs. He has since clarified that Tesla will continue to expand the Supercharger network, albeit at a slower rate, and has hired back some of the dismissed employees.\n\nMass production is key\n\nTesla\u2019s gap year leaves an opening for other EV makers, but there\u2019s a self-fulfilling aspect to all the talk of an EV slowdown in the US. Some automakers are concluding from Tesla\u2019s stumbles that they should hold back their own investments until there\u2019s more market clarity, said Corey Cantor, an EV analyst at BloombergNEF. Instead they should be following the lead of Hyundai and GM: Aggressively introduce affordable EV models to build economies of scale.\n\n\u201cAutomakers are probably freaking out too much, as usual, but there is a bit of a Tesla issue,\u201d Cantor said. \u201cIf they want to start taking market share, or even just perform at a high level, they need to start producing EVs at mass volume.\u201d\n\nNo car company besides Tesla has been able to produce a runaway EV success in the US \u2014 or sell more than 100,000 EVs a year across its EV lineup. This year Hyundai, GM and Ford are each on track to reach that 100,000 threshold of mass production, a potential turning point for US EV competition.\n\nSome of the biggest EV laggards are also jumping into the US market this year. Stellantis is expected to start selling its first electric Jeeps and Ram pickups and Hyundai is unleashing a diverse stable of EVs for its new factory opening in Georgia in October. Honda just started delivering the Acura ZDX and is building a production hub in Ohio for additional EVs coming in 2025. The list goes on.\n\nUS and worldwide EV sales are both expected to grow roughly 20% this year. That\u2019s less than the blistering 46% expansion the US experienced in 2023 \u2014 but that level of growth can\u2019t be sustained for long. If the global market for EVs continued at this \u201cslowdown\u201d pace indefinitely, virtually all cars would be electric in a decade.\n\nRead More:\n\nJB Straubel Built an EV Battery Colossus to Rival China Recycling Shatters the Myth of Electric Vehicle Waste How Three High-Tech Countries Became EV Laggards EVs Pass Tipping Point to Mass Adoption in 31 Countries\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNew York\u2019s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point The Dodgers Mogul and the Indian Infrastructure Giant That Wasn\u2019t The Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade When Business Is Just a Game A Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of \u2018Trump Forever\u2019\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Penny Stocks That Could Be Millionaire-Makers: May Edition",
        "content": "Investors largely look at penny stocks to buy from a trading or speculation perspective. The idea is to sell when the stock doubles or triples. In most cases, this strategy makes sense because penny stocks largely represent companies with average or poor fundamentals. The risk factor is therefore high and penny stocks are not worth holding in the core portfolio.\n\nHaving said that, there are exceptions. Several high-quality growth stocks of today were penny stocks at one point in time. In the universe of penny stocks, there will be at least 20% ideas that can make it big from a business perspective. If this happens, returns can be 20x, 50x, or 100x.\n\nTherefore, I would selectively look at penny stocks to buy and hold for the next five to seven years. This column discusses three such ideas that represents companies that have a promising future. Let\u2019s discuss the reasons to believe that these are millionaire-maker penny ideas.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCronos Group (CRON) CRON stock: Glass jars filled with medicinal cannabis\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) is among the most undervalued penny stocks to buy with millionaire-maker potential. Considering the size of the cannabis market in U.S. and Europe, CRON stock can deliver 20x to 30x returns by the end of the decade.\n\nOf course, the key is successful execution of growth plans. On that front, Cronos seems to be moving in the right direction. The first point to note is that the company has a cash buffer of $855 million. However, I don\u2019t see a spending splurge. Cronos has been judiciously using its cash buffer for gradual expansion.\n\nEarlier, Cronos had presence in Israel and Canada. However, in the last few quarters, the company has entered three new markets of Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom. With Germany recently legalizing the use of cannabis, Cronos is positioned to benefit.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Cronos reported healthy revenue growth of 30% on a year-on-year basis to $25.3 million. With entry into new markets, I expect revenue growth to accelerate. Further, as Cronos moves towards adjusted EBITDA break-even, the stock is likely to rally.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) Person holding smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe best time to buy a sector or stock is when sentiments are overwhelmingly negative. This holds true for lithium stocks and Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is a steal at current levels of $3.80. It\u2019s another story where 20x returns are likely by the end of the decade.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Lithium Americas commands a market valuation of $880 million. In comparison, the Thacker Pass lithium asset has an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion. Additionally, once both phases are operational, the asset is likely to deliver an average annual EBITDA of $2 billion. Clearly, LAC stock is trading at a deep valuation gap.\n\nStory continues\n\nI must add here that the Lithium Americas has received conditional commitment for a $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. General Motors (NYSE:GM) has also infused $650 million in two tranches.\u00a0 With financing in place, the company is targeting commercialization in 2027. I expect lithium to be significantly higher compared to current levels once production commences.\n\nSolid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) story being a 20-bagger or 30-bagger is based on the assumption that the company commercializes solid-state batteries. After an extended period of correction, SLDP stock has trended higher in the last six months. Backed by positive business developments, it seems that the stock has bottomed out.\n\nEarlier this year, Solid Power deepened ties with SK On to make inroads in the Korean markets. Solid Power will be installing a pilot cell production line for SK On at the Korea facility. Further, the Korean partner will use Solid Power\u2019s cell technology for R&D and to \u201cproduce batteries on a new SK On solid-state line in Korea.\u201d Parallel R&D effort is likely to help in accelerating commercialization.\n\nI must add that in December 2022, Solid Power had licensed its cell design and manufacturing processes to the BMW Group (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) for parallel research and development activities. BMW will be replicating Solid Power\u2019s cell pilot production lines at its facilities in Germany. The key point here is that Solid Power is working with some strong partners. This gives confidence that the company will achieve commercialization in the next 24 to 36 months.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "content": "The price of a stock matters. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) just announced a 10-for-1 stock split as its share price rose above $1,000 for the first time. In announcing the stock split, which will bring the share price down to about $100 a share, the company said that the lower price will make it \u201cmore accessible to employees and investors.\u201d Similarly, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) has announced a 50-for-1 stock split after its share price crested above $3,000. Investors often want to avoid the obstacle of shares being too expensive to purchase which is why they hunt for under $50 stocks.\n\nThe high price of a stock can prove to be a barrier to entry for many investors who may not have a lot of capital but want to grow their money nonetheless. The good news is there are plenty of stocks that can be purchased for less than $50. For investors looking to start small, buying shares of great companies at affordable prices is often the best course of action. Here are three under $50 stocks to buy in May 2024.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) 2024 Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup truck at the New York Auto Show. GM stock.\n\nSource: quiggyt4 / Shutterstock.com\n\nDetroit automaker General Motors\u2019 (NYSE:GM) stock is on an upswing. Year-to-date (YTD), GM stock has risen 22%. That brings its 12 month gain to 37%. Despite the rise, investors can still buy shares of General Motors for around $44 each. The stock has been marching higher ever since GM raised its 2024 guidance after beating Wall Street expectations across the board with its first-quarter earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors reported Q1 earnings per share (EPS) of $2.62 versus $2.15 that was expected among analysts. Revenue came in at $43.01 billion compared to $41.92 billion that was estimated. Sales rose 7.6% from a year earlier.\n\nOwing to the strong print, GM raised its guidance, saying it expects earnings of $9 to $10 a share, up from a previous range of $8.50 to $9.50 a share. Strong North American sales, particularly of pick-up trucks, is largely responsible for the growth at GM.\n\nCanada Goose Holdings (GOOS) canada goose (goos) logo on the sleeve of a jacket\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nCanada Goose Holdings (NYSE:GOOS) has seen a big earnings turnaround. The maker of winter parkas saw its stock jump 16% higher after it beat analyst expectations for its financial results. The company beat Wall Street forecasts across the board as its sales recovered in the key markets of China and the U.S. following months of declines. Canada Goose reported EPS of 19 cents CAD versus 7 cents CAD that was forecast among analysts. Revenue totaled $358 million CAD, beating Wall Street expectations of $315.5 million CAD.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe luxury parka maker\u2019s revenue in the entire Asia-Pacific region rose 29.6% in the quarter. In North America, sales grew 24.5% over the previous year after a 14% decline in the previous quarter. Management singled out China as a bright spot, noting that luxury brands are making a comeback in the nation of 1.4 billion people. The strong results come after Canada Goose announced in March of this year that it plans to cut 17% of its global workforce amid a prolonged slowdown in sales of luxury items.\n\nGOOS stock is now up 23% this year, though its shares can be bought for only $14.22 each.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a fast growing tech stock that can be purchased for less than $50, look to Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR). Investors can buy PLTR stock for only $21 a share, and the stock has been on a tear, rising 72% over the last 12 months, including a 27% gain since January. The data analytics company continues to post strong financial results that show continued profitability. For Q1 of this year, Palantir announced EPS of 8 cents, matching Wall Street expectations. The company has posted a profit for six consecutive quarters.\n\nRevenue in Q1 totaled $634 million versus estimates of $625 million. Sales were up 21% from a year ago. Earlier this year, Palantir signed a $178 million contract with the American military to develop a next-generation sensor station. The company also ran more than 650 \u201cbootcamps\u201d with prospective customers during Q1, allowing them to get hands-on time with the company\u2019s data analytics technology before deciding to make a purchase.\n\nSince going public in 2020, PLTR stock has increased 128%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "Betting on battery stocks to buy might not be the sharpest play in today\u2019s market. Much of it is due to the slowdown in EV markets, arguably the strongest catalyst for the battery sphere. With that impetus tapering off, many of the top battery stocks to buy are trading at deep discounts.\n\nSurely, the near-term upside in battery stocks is slim, bearing in mind the headwinds in the EV market. However, I doubt the current softness will impact the long-term bull case for battery stocks and the green energy space. The world is shifting towards a sustainable future, and batteries are a huge part of that. According to Mordor Intelligence forecasts, the market will soar to $171.8 billion by 2029, at an impressive 23.5% CAGR from 2024. Hence, without further ado, let\u2019s look at long-term battery stock plays for a more forward-looking portfolio.\n\nBattery Stocks to Buy: Albemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is one of the forerunners in the battery space involved in the production of lithium compounds, critical components in EV batteries. However, for reasons discussed earlier, ALB stock has fallen out of favor with investors and then some.\u00a0Its stock tanked almost 38% last year and is down 12.4% year-to-date (YTD). Consequently, it finds itself trailing its 52-week highs by nearly 50%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmid falling lithium prices in recent quarters, ALB\u2019s revenues and profits have taken a monumental beating. Revenue growth has been in the red in the past couple of quarters, with more than a 47% dip in its most recent one.\n\nNevertheless, its management remains bullish on lithium demand over the long-term, driven by the transition to electric mobility and the growing need for energy storage solutions. Meanwhile, ALB stock investors can continue benefitting from its solid dividend, which has grown for almost 30 consecutive years. Moreover, its management recently declared a new quarterly dividend of 40 cents, set to be distributed on July 1.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) Person holding smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) has been one of the more talked-about names in the lithium mining space in the past year or so. It\u2019s the powerhouse behind the much-touted Thacker Pass Project, poised for a massive splash in the lithium space. It used to be a much larger entity, but after spinning off its Argentinian operation, it\u2019s now squarely focused on commercializing the Thacker Pass Project.\n\nWork is in full swing at the Thacker Pass, which, at complete capacity, could produce enough lithium to power 800,000 EVs. Moreover, it boasts an estimated net present value (NPV) of a whopping $2.6 billion after taxes, making it a massive cash cow for LAC.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe mine is expected to produce 40,000 tons of lithium carbonate in its first phase and double-digit output in the second phase. The project received a stellar boost with a sizeable $2.26 billion Department of Energy loan, and General Motors\u2019 (NYSE:GM) $650 million investment has fully funded the first phase. Additionally, it recently raised another $275 million, pointing to healthy confidence in the firm\u2019s potential.\n\nPanasonic Holdings (PCRHY) a Panasonic TV\n\nSource: Panasonic\n\nJapanese electronics giant\u00a0Panasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRHY) has seen its stock flounder in line with the fluctuating EV space. However, the savvy investor may see the potential for a robust upside following recent geopolitical events. Particularly, the recent hike in U.S. tariffs on Chinese lithium-ion batteries, from 7.5% to 25%, could be a major tailwind for Panasonic as it ramps up its U.S. manufacturing capabilities. Moreover, it opened up a new facility in Kansas while operating its existing Nevada Giga 1 facility, reducing dependence on Chinese imports.\n\nFurthermore, Panasonic has been focusing on becoming a leaner and more focused operation. A big part of that is its switch to an unsponsored ADR, shielding it from the regulations and costs associated with sponsoring ADRs.\n\nMoreover, the firm has been looking to expand its partnerships beyond its famed Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0alliance. Over the past couple of years, it inked deals with Subaru, Mazda, and Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) in diversifying its revenue base. Hence, these developments make it an intriguing pick for those looking for battery stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "The EV Investor\u2019s Survival Guide: 7 Stocks to Buy Now for Long-Term Riches",
        "content": "Globally, the electric vehicle industry has faced multiple headwinds. These have come in the form of macroeconomic headwinds, higher interest rates, and intense industry competition. The result has been a sharp correction in EV stocks in the last few quarters. While there is some fear in the streets, I would look at EV stocks to buy for long-term.\n\nThroughout economic history, there has been booms and busts. When the industry has multi-decade tailwinds, there are dozens of new entrants. This results in a boom, but only handpicked survive in the long term and create real value. The same holds true for EV companies. There are hundreds of EV players globally. However, in the next five years, the markets will be dominated by few players that survive through innovation.\n\nThe focus of this column is therefore on EV stocks to buy that are likely to navigate the headwinds and emerge stronger. A portfolio of these stocks is likely to have millionaire-maker potential by the end of the decade.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has a history of proving critics wrong and I believe that it\u2019s likely to be the same this time. Amidst volatility, TSLA stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months. This is possibly an indication of the point that the bottom for the stock is around $160 to $180 levels.\n\nOf course, deliveries have disappointed and with cut in prices, it\u2019s likely that pressure on margins will sustain. However, Tesla is well positioned fundamentally to navigate the headwinds. Further, the Company has potentially game-changing plans in the pipeline.\n\nAs an example, Tesla is moving towards an \u201cunboxed\u201d approach. It\u2019s like \u201cbuilding Legos than a traditional production line.\u201d The new approach is likely to help in cutting cost by 50%. If this is achieved, Tesla will be positioned to expand margins. Further, the long due low-cost car might be on the cards for emerging markets. Therefore, innovation is the key and Tesla is on the forefront of innovation driven growth.\n\nBYD Company (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor Q4 2023, BYD Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) sold more electric vehicles than Tesla. With a leading market share, BYD is among the top EV companies to hold in the portfolio for multibagger returns.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that in the last 12 months, BYDDF stock has declined by 16%. This is on the back of macroeconomic headwinds and pricing pressure due to intense competition. However, the stock looks attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 20.1.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn important point to note is that China accounted for 60% of global EV sales last year. With BYD Company having a market share of 35.5% in China, the growth outlook remains positive.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that BYD is working on boosting presence in markets like Brazil, Indonesia, and India. In Brazil, the Company is constructing a new manufacturing facility with an annual production capacity of 150,000 units. These potentially high-growth markets will ensure that BYD continues to remain among the top two EV players globally.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) stock has witnessed a deep correction in the recent past. The reason is relatively disappointing numbers for Q1 2024. I see this as a golden buying opportunity with LI stock trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 17.5.\n\nI like the fact that Li Auto has exclusive focus on Chinese markets. The Company is boosting its retail presence and EV charging network within the country. The results have been exceptional when we compare deliveries growth and vehicle margin with the likes of Nio (NYSE:NIO) and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV).\n\nConcentrated presence has ensured that the Company is able to curb cost. Further, the balance sheet is string with a robust cash buffer of $13.7 billion as of Q1 2024. With the recent launch of Li MEGA and Li L6, it\u2019s likely that deliveries growth will be strong.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Li Auto is working on next-generation EV technology and smart vehicle solutions. In the coming years, it\u2019s enhanced features within the EV that will be the differentiating factor. Focus on technology is likely to ensure that Li Auto remains ahead of the curve.\n\nPanasonic Holdings (PCRFY) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing/Shutterstock.com\n\nSome of the best EV stocks have witnessed a meaningful correction in the last few quarters. However, Panasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) stock has remained sideways.\n\nThe reason is that PCRFY stock is already oversold. A forward price-earnings ratio of 8.5 underscores my view. It\u2019s therefore a good time to accumulate before this innovation driven EV battery manufacturer stock surges higher.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Panasonic has aggressive expansion plans. The Company intends to quadruple its EV battery capacity to 200GWh by 2031. I must agree that expansion plans for the foreseeable future have been scaled down. However, once growth accelerates, Panasonic has ample flexibility to aggressively invest. This provides revenue growth visibility coupled with potential EBITDA margin expansion in the coming years.\n\nOn the innovation front, Panasonic is targeting to boost battery energy density by 25% from current levels. To achieve this, the Company is looking at nano-composite silicon anode material for EV lithium-ion batteries. Focus on innovation will ensure that Panasonic maintains its market share.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith the plunge in lithium prices, some of the best lithium stocks have witnessed a sharp correction. I see this as a good accumulation opportunity for the long term. Considering the impending lithium supply-gap, it\u2019s likely that the metal will trend higher in the coming years.\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is possibly the best name to consider among lithium stocks. Even with multiple positive business developments, LAC stock has remained depressed. I would not be surprised with a big breakout rally once lithium trends higher.\n\nAs an overview, the Company has ownership of the Thacker Pass project. The asset has an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion with a mine life of 40 years. Further, the Company has guided for annual EBITDA of $2 billion from the asset once both phases commence production.\n\nWith the financing backing from General Motors (NYSE:GM) and the U.S. Department of Energy, the Company is working on the construction phase. The recent fund raising of $275 million through equity offering has also ensured that the project financing gap is closed.\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) Blink Stock Won't Be Able To Hold Its Charge\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAfter an extended period of correction, Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) stock has remained sideways for year-to-date. I see this as a good time to accumulate this EV charging infrastructure stock with positive business developments on the cards.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Blink Charging reported stellar revenue growth of 73% on a year-on-year basis to $37.6 million. For the same period, gross margin increased by 195% to $13.4 million.\n\nAn important point to note is that Blink has guided for full year gross margin of 33%. Additionally, the Company has reiterated its guidance for achieving positive adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2024. If this target is achieved, I expect BLNK stock to surge.\n\nI must add here that between Q1 2021 and Q1 2024, service revenue has increased at a CAGR of 189%. As more EV charging stations are installed, I expect healthy growth in service revenue to swell. This will support EBITDA margin expansion beyond 2024. Therefore, business metrics are encouraging in terms of top-line growth and profitability.\n\nSolid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong companies working on the commercialization of solid-state batteries, Solid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) is an attractive bet. If the Company can achieve success, I expect SLDP stock to deliver 20x to 30x returns from current levels.\n\nOne reason to be bullish on Solid Power is the backing of strong automotive partners. This includes Ford (NYSE:F), BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY), and SK On. As a matter of fact, the Company has licensed its cell design and technology to BMW and SK On for parallel research and development. This is likely to support an accelerated move towards commercialization.\n\nLast year, Solid Power had delivered A-1 sample cells to automotive partners for validation testing. The Company is targeting to advance its cell design and deliver A-2 sample cells to automotive players in 2024. At the same time, the Company has expanded its electrolyte sampling with shipments to multiple potential customers. The progress has therefore been positive and with a healthy cash buffer, investment in R&D will continue.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Kia, Hyundai And Worksport Defy The EV Slowdown Trend\n\nOn Thursday, Kia Corporation launched its first compact electric sports utility vehicle. Built on its dedicated EV platform,\u00a0the EV3\u00a0promises to\u00a0win over buyers\u00a0with\u00a0competitive pricing as Kia shows its determination to shrug off the\u00a0global EV slowdown.\u00a0Back in April, Kia stated its goal it is\u00a0to sell about 1.6 million EV units by the end of this decade.\n\nKia\u2019s Elevated Electric SUV Experience To Set New Standards\n\nThe EV3 is Kia\u2019s attempt to break the barriers to EV adoption by making an affordable vehicle, with the long-range model having a\u00a0driving range of about 600 kilometres or\u00a0373 miles\u00a0on a single charge.\u00a0The EV3 will be available in South Korea from July, with a European launch expected late this year and a U.S. launch sometime after 2025, with the delay being the result of\u00a0assessing the U.S. EV tax credit policy.\n\nThe EV3\u00a0is one of more than 31 electric models that Hyundai Motor Group,\u00a0therefore\u00a0Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF), Kia Corp and premium brand Genesis,\u00a0plans to introduce\u00a0by the end of this decade.\n\nKia And Hyundai Defied The EV Slowdown\n\nInterestingly, amid cooling EV sales, Kia and Hyundai Motor North America experienced an increased interest for their EV offerings. Moreover, Kia had its best ever month for EV sales in April, due to its new\u00a0E9 SUV.\u00a0With\u00a03,623\u00a0EVssold,\u00a0Kia recorded a\u00a061% increase\u00a0compared to its prior\u00a0record\u00a0from\u00a0April 2022.\u00a0Hyundai reported\u00a0EV sales\u00a0growth of26%\u00a0in April, fueled by Ioniq 5 crossover SUV and Ioniq 6 mid-size car\u00a0whose sales grew 59% and 41%, respectively. Hyundai also recorded a strong rise in its hybrid offerings as the Tucson posted a 44% sales rise. Hyundai has been exploring innovative solutions for its EV transformation for quite a while. Back in 2022, Hyundai America Technical Center entered into an agreement with\u00a0Worksport Ltd. (NASDAQ: WKSP)\u00a0to produce a working model of a solar-powered tonneau cover and customized version of a mobile battery generator system for an upcoming Hyundai vehicle. Worksport is expected to launch the alpha release of its off-grid power duo, first-to-market-solar-powered tonneau cover SOLIS this summer, followed by its innovative portable battery system COR.\n\nWorksport is set to revolutionize the clean energy solutions for light trucks.\n\nWorksport,\u00a0known for its innovative\u00a0clean energy solutions\u00a0intellectual property portfolio just provided its\u00a02024 revenue\u00a0guidance, forecasting\u00a0revenue growth from $1.5 million in year-end 2023, while expecting\u00a0between $6 million and $8 million for 2024, translating to\u00a0revenue growth\u00a0in the range between\u00a0300%\u00a0and\u00a0433%.\u00a0However, this projection is based solely on\u00a0Worksport\u2019s Automotive Accessory Business,\u00a0with the launch of SOLIS and COR bringing further revenue potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter the alpha release of its power duo, Worksport anticipates\u00a0the market launch of another tonneau cover in\u00a0the fourth quarter with demand expected to surpass that of all of its existing offerings. Earlier this year, Worksport announced that\u00a0SOLIS solar cover will be available for\u00a0the dimensions of Hyundai Motor Company,\u00a0Ford\u00a0Motor (NYSE: F),\u00a0General Motors (NYSE: GM) and\u00a0Stellantis\u00a0(NYSE: STLA) light pickup trucks, promising to ease range anxiety in electric pickups and revolutionize the landscape. Therefore, Worksport is expected to provide future updates to its financial guidance as soon as its revolutionary products hit the market.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Why Is General Motors (GM) Down 2.5% Since Last Earnings Report?",
        "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for General Motors (GM). Shares have lost about 2.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is General Motors due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nGeneral Motors Q1 Earnings Top Estimates\n\nGeneral Motors reported first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.62 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.08. The bottom line also increased from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level of $2.21. Solid results from the GMNA segment led to the outperformance. Revenues of $43.01 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.28 billion and increased from $39.9 billion recorded in the year-ago period.\n\nThe U.S. auto giant recorded adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $3.87 billion, slightly higher than $3.8 billion in the prior-year quarter. The automaker\u2019s share in the GM market was 8.1% in the reported quarter compared with 8.7% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nGM North America (\u201cGMNA\u201d) generated net revenues of $36.1 billion, up from $32.9 billion recorded in the corresponding period of 2023. The figure also outpaced our model projection of $33.5 billion on higher-than-expected deliveries. Wholesale vehicle sales in the GMNA unit totaled 792,000 units, up from 723,000 units reported in the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed our estimate of 718,000 units. The segment\u2019s operating profit totaled $3.84 billion, up from $3.57 billion recorded in the year-earlier period. The metric also exceeded our estimate of $2.75 billion.\n\nGM International's\u00a0(\u201cGMI\u201d) net revenues in the reported quarter amounted to $3.08 billion, down from the year-ago quarter\u2019s $3.72 billion. The metric also missed our estimate of $3.96 billion due to lower-than-expected deliveries. The segment\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales of 104,000 units decreased from 141,000 units in the year-ago quarter and also missed our projection of 148,000 units. GMI reported an operating loss of $10 million against a profit of $347 million generated in the year-ago period due to low equity income. Our estimate was an operating profit of $464.7 million.\n\nGM Financial generated net revenues of $3.81 billion in the quarter, up from $3.34 billion recorded in the year-ago period and ahead of our prediction of $3.48 billion. The segment recorded an EBIT-adjusted operating profit of $737 million, down from $771 million recorded in the year-ago period. The metric surpassed our prediction of $691 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nGM Cruise recorded net revenues of $25 million in the fourth quarter, flat year over year. The metric came in line with our projection as well. The segment posted an operating loss of $442 million, narrower than a loss of $561 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The reported loss was, however, wider than our estimate of a loss of $358 million.\n\nFinancial Position\n\nGeneral Motors had cash and cash equivalents of $17.64 billion as of Mar 31, 2024. The long-term automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $15.9 billion. Net automotive cash provided by operating activities amounted to $3.6 billion during the quarter under review. The company recorded an adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.09 billion in first-quarter 2024, significantly improving from negative $132 recorded in the year-ago period.\n\nGM declared its second-quarter dividend of 12 cents per share. The dividend will be paid on Jun 20, 2024, to shareholders of record as of Jun 7, 2024.\n\nRevised 2024 Guidance\n\nFor full-year 2024, GM now expects adjusted EBIT in the range of $12.5-$14.5 billion, up from $12-$14 billion guided earlier. Adjusted EPS is anticipated in the range of $9-$10, up from $8.50-$9.50, guided earlier. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is expected in the band of $8.5-$10.5 billion, higher than the prior forecast of $8-$10 billion. Capex is predicted to be in the $10.5-$11.5 billion range, up from the previous guidance of $10-$11 billion.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, estimates revision have trended upward during the past month.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted 14.14% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, General Motors has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, General Motors has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Under $20 stocks are the way to go, as J.P. Morgan forecasts a \u201csoft landing\u201d for the U.S. economy this year, and with persistent inflation, Middle East tensions, and the upcoming U.S. election, investors will certainly want to err on the side of caution.\n\nThe economy as a whole is under pressure, at least until we get the next of three rate cuts, which could make it hard for the stock market. J.P. Morgan expects only modest earnings growth and is careful with risky assets. Morningstar recommends a move toward value stocks and small to mid-cap stocks.\n\nIn addition, now is the time to invest in under $20 stocks, as J.P. Morgan predicts the Federal Reserve will start lowering the Fed Funds rate in the middle of the year, to get it to a range of 4.00% to 4.25% by the end of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe first among our under $20 stocks is a famous American car company with a 24% upside that is now making great progress in electric cars. The next one is a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miner that has a possible 77% gain and is getting bigger after the fourth split. Lastly, a stock is set to make a lot of money now that it has split its operations, now focusing on the Thacker Pass project full-time, leading to a potential 78% rise in value.\n\nFord Motor (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord Motor (NYSE:F) sold more hybrid cars than ever before in April, a 60% rise from the previous year, building on first-quarter sales growth of 86%. Ford\u2019s targeting a production goal of 2 million units by 2026, having committed over $50 billion towards its electric vehicle (EV) initiatives under a Ford+ (Ford Plus) strategy emphasizing EVs.\n\nUnder the plan, Ford will turn its Ontario Oakville Assembly Plant into a complex for making electric cars. New three-row electric vehicles will be available in 2027. The Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center is part of the BlueOval City project in Tennessee, which plans to start making a new electric truck by 2026.\n\nAs part of its Climate Action Plan, the City of Dallas has teamed up with Ford Pro to improve its EV charging facilities. The goal is to have all of the city\u2019s vehicles run on electricity by 2040; the deal greatly bolsters Ford\u2019s image in the EV business.\n\nRegarding products, Ford just debuted the updated 2024 Ranger vehicle in North America. In order to highlight its high-performance off-road vehicles, Ford is also previewing the new Ford Raptor for the 2025 Dakar Rally; GPS, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and a 12-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound system are standard on all Ranger Raptors.\n\nStory continues\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Platforms\u2019 (NASDAQ:RIOT) net income for the first quarter was $211.8 million, 1,000% more than the year-ago period, thanks to a big rise in Bitcoin\u2019s value, which also led to a 55.4% year-over-year rise in mining earnings, which reached $74.6 million.\n\nEven with these improvements, Riot Platforms\u2019 overall income for the quarter was $79.3 million, which was about 14% less than what analysts had predicted, chiefly because mining difficulty is going up.\n\nThings will only get tougher for Riot Platforms moving forward, especially considering the fourth Bitcoin halving, which took place on April 19, split Bitcoin\u2019s mining reward in half.\n\nRiot Platforms understands this situation, which is why it\u2019s improving its infrastructure smartly. It aims to reach a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 31 EH/s by the end of 2024.\n\nWhen its generator turned on, the Corsicana Facility took a big step toward becoming the biggest known Bitcoin mining facility. Riot\u2019s ability to mine for itself should grow by 16 EH/s just because of this plant alone by the end of 2024.\n\nRiot Platforms has also announced placing large orders for more miners, including requests for 33,280 immersion miners and a possible extra 66,560 miners. When they are all set up, they could increase Riot\u2019s output by up to 28 EH/s.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC, LAAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) has split into two parts, making Lithium Americas (Argentina) Corp (NYSE:LAAC) a separate unit in Argentina, while LAC is advancing the Thacker Pass project.\n\nIn Nevada\u2019s Humboldt County, the Thacker Pass project wants to make 80,000 tonnes of battery-grade lithium carbonate every year, making it one of the biggest lithium makers in North America. After getting state permissions and court orders, the building began in early 2023. It\u2019ll improve the U.S. lithium supply chain, which is important for electric cars, and make the U.S. less reliant on lithium sources from other countries.\n\nThe processing plants were built with loans from different sources, including a $2.26 billion credit from the U.S. Department of Energy; General Motors (NYSE:GM) also contributed $650 million to the project as a key partner.\n\nBechtel and Thacker Pass have an EPCM deal. The main building work is set to start in the second half of 2024, and phase 1 production will start in 2026, meaning it\u2019s not too late to get in on the action, making this a hidden gem among under $20 stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "Federal Circuit Overturns GM's Patent Win Against Auto-Parts Provider LKQ\n\nGeneral Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) has experienced a setback in its legal battle against aftermarket auto parts provider LKQ Corp. (NASDAQ:LKQ) regarding fender designs.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned a previous decision favoring GM, marking a\u00a0huge\u00a0shift in design-patent law with a rare full-court decision.\n\nReuters reported that the Federal Circuit Court discarded a long-standing test for determining the validity of a design patent and remanded the case to the U.S. Patent Office for further review.\n\nMeanwhile, LKQ\u2019s attorney, Mark Lemley, described the ruling as vital to providing consumers with safer, quality repair options.\n\nDesign patents safeguard the unique visual features of manufactured items. In 2022, LKQ requested the USPTO\u2019s Patent Trial and Appeal Board to invalidate a GM design patent for a front vehicle fender after their licensing agreement lapsed, and GM threatened legal action.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a0General Motors, LG Establish $150M Settlement Fund For Bolt EV Battery Issues:\u00a0Report\n\nLKQ contended that GM\u2019s patent was\u00a0obvious\u00a0by comparing it to two earlier designs, but the board ruled in GM\u2019s favor. A three-judge panel at the Federal Circuit later upheld this decision.\n\nThe\u00a0full\u00a0Federal Circuit agreed\u00a0last June\u00a0to revisit the case, marking its first full-court rehearing in a patent case since 2018.\n\nLKQ argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s 2007 decision, which rejected rigid and mandatory formulas for utility patents, should apply to design patents\u00a0as well.\n\nSeveral auto parts companies supported LKQ, claiming that maintaining the current test would increase the cost and reduce the availability of replacement parts.\n\nConversely, companies like\u00a0Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) advocated\u00a0for\u00a0retaining the existing test to ensure a predictable patent landscape.\n\nThe Federal Circuit sided with LKQ, deeming the current test\u00a0as\u00a0improperly rigid and suggesting a more flexible approach\u00a0akin\u00a0to the utility-patent obviousness test.\n\nPrice Action: At the last check on Wednesday, GM shares were trading lower by 1.54% at $44.24.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nGENERAL MOTORS (GM): Free Stock Analysis Report LKQ (LKQ): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Federal Circuit Overturns GM's Patent Win Against Auto-Parts Provider LKQ originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "General Motors (GM) &amp; LG to Create $150M Fund for Bolt Owners",
        "content": "General Motors Company GM and LG Energy Solution have agreed to establish a $150 million relief fund for Chevrolet Bolt EV owners affected by faulty batteries.\r\n\r\nGM used LG-manufactured batteries in its Chevrolet Bolt EVs. Following a few fire complaints in some vehicles, the automaker recalled around 141,000 vehicles between late 2020 and 2021.\r\n\r\nThe settlement, which awaits judge approval, creates a fund to compensate Bolt EV owners. Per documents filed with Michigan Eastern District Court, the owners of the recalled Bolt EVs who received a battery replacement or installed the software fix are eligible for $1,400 while those who sold or leased their vehicle before the settlement date will get a minimum of $700. Around 102,560 Bolt EV owners will receive the compensation.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, GM halted production of the Bolt EV to make way for the new EVs. In 2021, the automaker announced a billion-dollar recall campaign for thousands of Bolt EVs, which resulted in a production and sales halt of Bolt for more than six months.\r\n\r\nGM's Chevy Bolt battery issues and low EV sales have hurt its market share, which fell to 2.8% in the first quarter from 3.4% in the previous year.\r\n\r\nDespite setbacks from battery issues, General Motors remains committed to its EV strategy and plans to phase out gas-powered cars by 2035.\r\n\r\nThe automaker aims to double its EV production capacity and reach profitability by mid-2024, despite last year's demand slowdown. The company reported a 36% sequential increase in US Ultium EV battery deliveries in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nPer Paul Jacobsen, CFO of GM, ramped-up production at the automaker's Ohio and Tennessee plants has reduced Cadillac Lyriq EV production costs by $12,000. The Tennessee plant will reach full capacity by year-end.\r\n\r\nThis increased production keeps General Motors on track to achieve its production and wholesale volume target of 200-300 thousand units in 2024, which is down from its earlier goal of 400 thousand units. The company is aiming for EV profitability in the second half of the year.\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nGM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked players in the auto space are Geely Automobile Holdings Limited GELYY, Blue Bird Corporation BLBD and Oshkosh Corporation OSK, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 30 countries with lowest car ownership rates in the world. If you are up for the challenge, you can see the 30 Countries with the lowest car rates in the world here.\n\nCar Ownership in the US: At a Glance\n\nOn March 28, Forbes reported that 278.87 million personal and commercial vehicles were registered in the United States in 2022. Trucks remained the most popular choice with almost 170.24 million registered personal and commercial trucks in 2022 alone. On the other hand, 98.57 million cars were registered, the second most popular choice of vehicle in the United States. Almost 92% of households across the nation owned one vehicle. Idaho and Wyoming had an ownership rate of 96.2% each, the highest recorded percentage in the US. 64% of households in the District of Columbia had at least one vehicle, the lowest percentage recorded in the United States in 2022.\n\nOn January 22, CNBC reported that China exported 5 million vehicles in 2023 becoming the country with the highest car exports in the world. Primary supply comes from state-owned companies like SAIC and Dongfeng. The United States, on the other hand, is the fourth largest exporter of cars. Leaders in the auto industry are wary of Chinese automakers, especially due to their profitable and rapid introduction of new models. BYD Auto, a leading automotive company in China, toppled Tesla's position to become the largest seller of electric vehicles (EVs) in 2023. The company received almost $4.3 billion from the Chinese government between 2015 and 2020. Due to this, its EVs are priced considerably low, for instance, the BYD Seagull starts at almost $11,400.\n\nThe US continues to impose tariffs on Chinese imports to curb competition from Chinese automakers. On May 14, Reuters reported that Biden announced quadrupling EV duties to over 100% from 25% and increasing duties on semiconductors to 50%. These new policies will impact imported Chinese goods worth $18 billion including aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles, minerals, solar cells, and cranes. In 2023, the United States imported commodities worth $427 billion from China and only exported $148 billion worth of goods to the country. You can also take a look at the best electric cars of 2024.\n\nHow Are Automakers in the US Combating Competition from China\n\nFord Motor Company (NYSE:F) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) are among the leading automotive companies in the United States. You can also take a look at the best fuel-efficient cars under $30k.\n\nFord Motor Company (NYSE:F) is a multinational automobile maker headquartered in Michigan, United States. The company sells SUVs, trucks, vans, electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, and cars with a strong emphasis on expanding its EV line. On April 4, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) announced that by 2030, the company expects to launch hybrid powertrains across its Ford Blue lineup in North America. The company also aims to transform its Oakville Assembly Plant, from a gas vehicle assembly to an EV manufacturing unit. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) intends to launch three-row electric vehicles at the assembly by 2027. To back its position in the EV market, in the first quarter of 2024, the company witnessed an 86% rise in electric vehicle sales. Hybrid sales, on the other hand, grew by 42% compared to 12 months ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is another prominent automotive player in the United States and a major exporter to China, delivering 441,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2024 and 2.1 million vehicles in 2023. The company owns some of the leading automotive brands including Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac, OnStar, and ACDelco. Its electric vehicle segment is constantly expanding. The company's new Chevy Silverado EV RST is fully electric with an estimated range of 400 miles, higher than most of its competitors, and accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour in under 4.5 seconds. General Motors Company's (NYSE:GM) Silverado EV 4WT, an extension of the RST, offers an estimated 450 miles of range and a maximum towing capability of 10,000 lbs.\n\nNow that we have studied the car ownership industry in the US, let's discuss the 30 countries with the lowest car ownership rates in the world. You can also read our piece on the cheap cars that will make you look rich.\n\nAn auto warehouse filled with newly acquired used cars.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn order to compile a list of the countries with the lowest car ownership rates in the world, we sourced our data from the Insider Monkey Global Vehicle Motorization Index. We commenced our research by consulting The International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA) to acquire 2015 data for the total number of vehicles in 140 countries. We then acquired the 2015 country-wise population from the World Bank to tabulate the cars per capita and GDP per capita from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to assess the correlation between GDP per capita and cars per capita for each country. We used the relationship to estimate the number of cars in 2015 for all the missing countries. We then acquired the 2020 data for total registered cars from OICA for 62 countries and calculated a global average growth rate from 2015 to 2020. Assuming constant growth rates from 2015 to 2024, we calculated the expected number of cars in 2024. To view our index methodology which highlights all our sources and calculations, you can take a look at the Insider Monkey Global Vehicle Motorization Index.\n\nThe country with the lowest car ownership rate is Ethiopia.\n\n1. Ethiopia\n\nCars per Capita (2024): 0.0018\n\nCars per 1,000 People (2024): 2\n\nTotal Number of Registered Cars (2024): 227,582\n\nEthiopia ranks first on our list of the countries with the lowest car ownership rate. It has only 2 cars per 1,000 inhabitants and over 227,000 total registered cars.\n\nYou can see the rest of the rankings here.\n\nYou can also check out the list of the 25 Countries that own the most cars per capita here.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

        "content": "EV stocks to buy have been popular since Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares made several \u201cTesla millionaires.\u201d\n\nEarly Tesla stock investors, notably during the IPO, made big money. Regular retail investors like Laura Goldman bought early after the IPO and now owns over $1 million in stock. Same with early investor Basel Termanini who saw his stake increase to around $2.5 million. The stock has returned 13,764% overall.\n\nFurther increases are predicted, with worldwide electric car sales reaching 17 million by year\u2019s end. Sales rose 25% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla shares are costly for the ordinary investor. So in your quest to become the next industry millionaire, hunt for EV stocks to buy with at least a double-digit upside.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best EV stocks to buy is Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) thanks to its $14.6 billion cash reserve and 800,000-unit sales forecast. Li Auto stands out among EV stocks due to being profitable on a net profit basis posting net income of 11.8 billion renminbi (RMB) ($1.7 billion), marking it as a standout among a trio of Chinese EV startups.\n\nIt aims to sell 800,000 devices by 2024 and open 800 outlets. Li will also deliver new models, like the 2024 L7 and L8 Air, in May at reduced prices. The cars boast improved suspensions and early birds will get subsidies from the company.\n\nMeanwhile, the manufacturer is celebrating the April debut of the sub-300,000 RMB Li L6. With 30,000 monthly sales, Li hopes to compete with Tesla\u2019s Model Y.\n\nLi Auto shareholders require these actions after 80,400 deliveries in Q1, up 52.9% year-over-year but behind its 100,000 vehicle objective. In April, the automaker shipped 25,787 automobiles, 0.4% more than last year but 12% less sequentially.\n\nHowever, due to its \u201cbest-in-class\u201d management team and history of meeting ambitious objectives, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu raised it to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201chold\u201d despite decreasing the price objective by $4 to $41. Also recently, Bank of America lowered its price target for Li Auto but kept a \u201cbuy\u201d rating owing to 2024 EV optimism.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) will invest $35 billion on EVs through 2025 as it looks to broaden its appeal in an age when gasoline cars are fading. Analysts rate it a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d with an upside potential of 22%.\n\nHowever, GM is an established heritage automaker with multiple successful business lines. Even though GM doesn\u2019t say how much money its EV line makes, CFO Paul Jacobson said the division continues to lose money.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, GM can afford this as it sold nearly 6.2 million vehicles in 2023, up from 5.9 million units in 2022. With U.S. sales the best since 2019, it gives GM plenty of cushion to pursue its EV ambitions. Due to strong U.S. demand for pickup trucks and bigger cars, the firm boosted its full-year profit prediction from $10.1 billion to $11.5 billion.\n\nGM aims to produce between 200,000 and 300,000 Ultium-based EVs in 2024, after delivering 75,883 EVs delivered in 2023. Over and above that, the automaker will introduce V2H charging to all Ultium-based EVs by 2026. This will allow EVs to power homes during power blackouts.\n\nFurthermore, GM is doubling the number of batteries it makes at its Factory Zero building to alleviate potential delays and is hiring former Tesla experts to streamline its processes.\n\nUltimately, CEO Mary Barra said it best, referring to 2024 as the \u201cyear of execution,\u201d making sure to cement its position among the best EV stocks to buy.\n\nChargePoint Holdings (CHPT) EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint charging station.\n\nSource: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.com\n\nOffering over 274,000 active charging ports worldwide, ChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT) is a crucial supplier of EV infrastructure. Analysts rate it a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d and project a 76% upside. Last year, the company reported 53% more charge events and distributed over 1 terawatt-hour of energy.\n\nMeanwhile, ChargePoint has raised $232 million, including $175 million from institutional investors and $57 million from additional shares purchased. The capital will help ChargePoint become profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis by the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2025. It lost $94.7 million in the latest quarterly results.\n\nChargePoint is trying to reorganize its operations by decreasing its workforce by 12%, which may save $33 million in yearly operating expenses.\n\nChargePoint has also released a new three-megawatt charging system that is meant to help the trucking business grow in the future. The business has also teamed up with Jumptech to provide quick and easy home EV charger setups for fleets.\n\nFinally, ChargePoint is growing its business in Europe by taking advantage of its strong standing as a leader in North America. Currently, it is active in 16 European countries.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "Volkswagen\u2019s (VWAGY) Audi is pushing deeper into the Chinese market as US rivals like GM (GM) and Ford (F) look to minimize losses in the region and the US ramps up tariffs on Chinese EVs.\n\nOn Monday, Audi announced it had signed a deal with China's state-owned SAIC to develop new EVs for the mainland.\n\nAudi said the SAIC deal would begin with three new EVs models covering the B and C segments \u2014 small to midsize vehicles \u2014 with the first model entering the market in 2025. Audi said the deal with SAIC will reduce its time-to-market by more than 30%.\n\nAudi CEO Gernot D\u00f6llner said the deal \"marks a significant milestone in Audi\u2019s China strategy.\"\n\n\"We have a clear and common goal: to combine the best of our two companies to the full advantage of our Chinese customers with Audi\u2019s premium experience and SAIC\u2019s innovation speed in China,\" D\u00f6llner said.

(Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images) (VCG via Getty Images)\n\nThe German luxury automaker said the co-developed EVs will feature \u201cAudi\u2019s distinct DNA,\u201d which suggests VW intends to leverage the Audi brand\u2019s goodwill in a region where local buyers place a premium on German brands like Audi, BMW, and Mercedes.\n\nSales for German automakers in China, however, have slipped recently as domestic automakers gain share. Volkswagen\u2019s China sales rose 1.6% in 2023 as the company lost market share to upstarts like BYD and NIO amid what the company called \"challenging market conditions.\"\n\nMonday's announcement comes after VW signed a major deal with Chinese startup XPeng and announced plans to boost its partnership with SAIC back in July of 2023.\n\nAt the time, VW said it would partner with XPeng to produce two new EVs with Volkswagen branding that would be powered by XPeng\u2019s software and EV engineering.\n\nThose two models are set to arrive in 2026, with Volkswagen investing around $700 million for a 4.99% percent stake in XPeng. Volkswagen CEO Oliver Blume speaks during a media event held by the Volkswagen Group a day before the auto show in Beijing, Wednesday, April 24, 2024. The Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi and Porsche, plans to launch 40 new models in China over the next three years and to have a lineup of 30 EVs by 2030. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nGM, which has joint ventures with several Chinese automakers, has seen its sales and market share slip precipitously in recent years.\n\nWhile GM focuses on the US market, which is powered by trucks and SUVs, the company said it is still committed to the Chinese market. Earlier this month, the company named a new head at GM China.\n\nFord has seen sales slide in China since 2016 and has been cutting costs in the country, though it has seen China-made exports climb higher into other regions.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley has noted the difficulties in selling EVs profitably and has said he is open to partnering with Chinese EV makers to cut development costs. GM CEO Mary Barra also said she was amenable to a Chinese EV partner.\n\nStory continues\n\nStellantis, the more internationally-focused of Detroit\u2019s Big Three is doing what Ford and GM have suggested are viable options: partnering with Chinese brand Leapmotor to build EVs in China that will be sold in the domestic market, as well as exported to regions like Europe.\n\nThe threat of Chinese exports, in particular EVs, led the Biden administration last week to quadruple tariffs on Chinese EVs.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Good morning, Broadsheet readers! Reese's Book Club dominates the literary landscape, five states will have abortion rights on their November ballots, and GM tries to salvage its $10 billion investment in self-driving business Cruise after a scary safety incident. Have a productive Monday!\n\n- Safety first. As General Motors poured $10 billion into autonomous driving startup Cruise, GM CEO Mary Barra hoped that the investment would help the automaker pull ahead in the EV race. GM has manufactured electric vehicles since the 1990s, but has been outshone by Tesla\u2014and GM's strategy is still go to 100% electric by 2035. Barra believed in the technology so much she posted a video on her LinkedIn two years ago in which she was thrilled by her first ride in a Cruise car. \"I can't stop smiling,\" she said at the time.\n\nBut a serious safety incident last year has put that all in jeopardy. In October 2023, a self-driving robotaxi in San Francisco hit a woman, ran over her, and dragged her for 20 feet. The car incorrectly labeled the incident a \"side collision\" and tried to pull over, not registering it was dragging a person along with it.\n\nThe non-fatal incident set off a wave of re-evaluation and restructuring at GM and Cruise, my colleague Jessica Mathews reports in a new Fortune investigation. For GM, the incident has taken one of Barra's most promising investments (GM owns 80% of Cruise) from a \"crown jewel\" to a \"liability,\" Jessica writes.\n\nThe upheaval arrived as Barra was simultaneously managing last year's UAW strike against the Big Three automakers. GM replaced most of Cruise's management team and eventually settled with the woman who was hit for somewhere between $8 million and $12 million. And as Jessica writes, the incident showed the power of a Fortune 500 giant like GM to salvage an upstart self-driving business, compared to a typical startup trying to save itself after a disaster. When an analyst said that the incident was \"un-GM-like,\" Barra told him, \"I agree with you.\"\n\nRead Jessica's full investigation here.\n\nEmma Hinchliffe\r\nemma.hinchliffe@fortune.com\n\nThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

However, hit by the financial crisis, General Motors filed for bankruptcy on Jun 1, 2009. Just within 40 days, the firm emerged from bankruptcy. In 2010, the company launched its IPO \u2013 the biggest in U.S. history at that time \u2013 and has been steadily profitable since then.

Significant improvements in pricing, EV mix and parts sales resulted in record results for the first half of fiscal year 2024, prompting Blue Bird to raise its forecasts for the year.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Blue Bird\u2019s fiscal 2024 and 2025 sales implies year-over-year growth of 17.3% and 13%, respectively. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed earnings estimates on all occasions, the average surprise being 92.4%. The consensus mark for EPS implies year-over-year growth of 140% and 2%, respectively. BLBD is witnessing northbound estimate revisions for the current and next fiscal year. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nGeneral Motors: One of the world\u2019s largest automakers, General Motors\u2019 hot-selling brands in America \u2014 namely Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac \u2014 are boosting the top line. Out of the 23 brokers covering GM stock, 14 have Strong Buy recommendations. Including one Buy rating, seven Hold ratings and one Strong Sell Rating, General Motors\u2019 ABR of 1.83 is still favorable.\n\nGM has surged roughly 26% year to date and is currently trading at around $45/share, with the possibility of more upside. The Zacks average price target of $52.6/share suggests a nearly 17% upside for the stock from the current levels.\n\nGeneral Motors\u2019 compelling EV and ICE portfolio, with strong demand for its quality pickups and full-size SUVs, bodes well for delivery growth. The company is swiftly advancing in its electrification journey, bolstered by a remarkable 300% surge in battery module production over the last six months. Its cost-reduction efforts, superior liquidity profile (total automotive liquidity of $33.3 billion as of Mar 31, 2024) and investor-friendly moves also instill confidence. GM is also attractively valued, trading at forward earnings multiple of 4.82, below its median of 6.02 over the last five years.\n\nGM currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors\u2019 2024 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 1.7% and 22.4%, respectively. The consensus mark for GM\u2019s 2024 and 2025 EPS has moved north by 32 cents and 29 cents, respectively, over the past 30 days. In the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on all occasions, the average surprise being 18%.\n\nDorman Products: The company is a key player in the motor vehicle aftermarket industry, focusing on replacement and upgrade parts. Of the three brokers covering Dorman Products stock, two have a Strong Buy rating and the other has a Hold rating, with the ABR being 1.67. The stock has risen roughly 11% so far this year and seemingly has more upside. The Zacks average price target of $108.67 is still 17% above the current levels.\n\nDorman consistently expands its product line, introducing hundreds of new direct replacement parts and assemblies designed to match or improve upon the performance of original equipment. In 2023, the company reached record annual sales of $1.93 billion, marking a 13% increase year over year. The acquisition of Super ATV has significantly boosted the company's overall prospects.\n\nDorman's dedication to regular product launches and ongoing innovation fuels its sustained growth. With a strong balance sheet, a manageable debt-to-capitalization ratio of 29% (compared to the industry average of 42%) and ample liquidity, Dorman is well-poised for success. Investor-friendly moves via share buybacks further instill confidence.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dorman Products\u2019 2024 and 2025 sales implies year-over-year growth of 4% and 5%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS implies year-over-year growth of 24% and 12%, respectively. DORM is witnessing northbound estimate revisions for the current and next year. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "(Reuters) -General Motors and South Korea's LG Energy Solution, LG Electronics reached a settlement to establish a $150 million fund to provide relief to Chevrolet Bolt EV owners affected by defective batteries, documents filed in a U.S. court on Thursday showed.\n\nGeneral Motors first launched Chevrolet Bolt EVs in 2015, and used batteries made by LG entities as part of a business arrangement with the car manufacturer. GM started recalls in 2020 after it faced numerous complaints about fires in some vehicles.\n\n\"GM, LG Energy Solution and LG Electronics have agreed to a settlement with plaintiffs to resolve class action litigation related to the Bolt EV battery recall,\" GM said in an emailed statement to Reuters.\n\n\"As a result, Bolt owners who received a battery replacement or who have installed the latest advanced diagnostic software may qualify for compensation,\" the company said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOwners of the recalled Bolt EVs who installed the final software remedy at a GM-authorized dealership before Dec. 31, 2023 may receive up to $1,400, according to documents filed with Michigan eastern district court.\n\nOwners who sold or terminated the lease of their vehicle before the software remedy became available and those who already received a battery replacement will receive a minimum $700 payment, according to the filing.\n\nLast year, GM ended production of the Bolt EV to make room for new electric vehicles.\n\nIn 2021, the company had announced a billion dollar recall campaign to cover thousands of Bolts over battery fire risks.

        "title": "What Do U.S. Tariffs Mean for Chinese Automakers Li Auto and NIO?",
        "content": "U.S. President Joe Biden announced a new 100% tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles\u00a0(EVs) on May 14 as part of a wider set of measures to protect U.S. producers from cheap and subsidized imports. The measure is designed to protect the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) from companies like BYD (NASDAQ:BYDDF), Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), and NIO (NASDAQ:NIO). However, I don\u2019t expect the tariffs to have any material impact on these companies. Therefore, I remain bullish on Li Auto and neutral on NIO.\n\nThe announcement sees the tariff on Chinese EVs imported into the U.S. quadruple from 25% to 100%. However, the act seems largely symbolic, with most Chinese automakers focusing their efforts on the sizeable indigenous market and, to a lesser extent, Europe and the Middle East.\n\nWhat Do Tariffs Mean for Li Auto and NIO?\n\nThe Biden administration claims that the new measures are a response to Chinese overproduction. It says the country is producing as many as 30 million EVs annually while indigenous market demand is much weaker \u2014 around 22-23 million. So, what does this higher tariff mean for Li Auto and NIO? Well, very little. Currently,\u00a0neither Li nor NIO has a major presence in the U.S. market.\u00a0Thus,\u00a0the immediate impact on sales might be minimal.\n\nNIO had previously said it was looking at entering the North American market in 2025 but later backtracked on plans, saying it was \u201cdebating\u201d whether to do so. While its plans were fluid, NIO was one of the only Chinese EV makers to publicly consider entering the U.S. market. However, success in the U.S. market has arguably never been part of the investment hypothesis.\n\nAccording to the Chinese media outlet LatePost, Li Auto plans to enter the overseas market this year, initially focusing on the Middle East, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and some North African countries. The report, citing several people familiar with the matter, said the first model available overseas would be the flagship L9. There was no mention of the U.S. market.\n\nInterestingly, Li Auto\u2019s decision to push toward the Middle East appears to be influenced by some observational data. Li Auto\u2019s management said staff had noted that 200 of its vehicles sold in July 2023 weren\u2019t insured in China. On closer inspection, the company realized that traders were buying the vehicles and shipping them overseas \u2014 mostly to the Middle East and Central Asia. CEO Li Xiang posted a picture of an L7 for sale in Kazakhstan priced $25,800 higher than its starting price in China.\n\nAs such, the Biden administration\u2019s new tariff regimen seems little more than symbolic, and potentially political, as U.S. presidential challenger Donald Trump had threatened to take similar measures should he return to power. Being \u201chard on China\u201d remains popular with voters.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould I Invest in Li Auto or NIO?\n\nI hold Li Auto shares and remain bullish on the company despite a downturn in production and delivery performance this year. The company, which had previously focused on the EREV (extended range electric vehicle) market before recently releasing its first BEV (battery electric vehicle), currently trades at 16.1x forward earnings. That\u2019s remarkably cheap compared to Tesla, which is more than four times more expensive.\n\nLi Auto is expected to deliver earnings per share growth of 13.5% annually over the medium term \u2014 the next three to five years. In turn, this leads us to a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.06x. This figure used to be much lower, but growth forecasts appear to have been dialed down after a disappointing start to 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m unconvinced by NIO. The stock has recently staged a recovery but is priced at a fraction of its pandemic-era highs. NIO isn\u2019t expected to turn a profit until 2027, and it\u2019s currently trading around 23.3x expected earnings for that year.\n\nWhile some analysts remain bullish on NIO, I\u2019m also unsure whether its battery-swapping technology really represents the way forward. Its battery-swapping station infrastructure will be a revenue-generating activity, but it requires a huge amount of CapEx to build. And with charging speeds increasing all the time, I do wonder whether battery-swapping will become obsolete.\n\nIs Li Auto Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nLi Auto stock is rated a Strong Buy according to\u00a0the ratings of 12\u00a0Wall Street analysts offering 12-month price targets. There are currently 12 Buys and one Hold rating. The average Li Auto stock price target is\u00a0$48.26,\u00a0with a high forecast of\u00a0$65.00\u00a0and a low forecast of\u00a0$25.00. The average price target represents 91.6% upside potential.\n\nIs NIO Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nNIO stock is rated a Moderate Buy on TipRanks. This is based on seven Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell rating. The average NIO stock price target is\u00a0$6.63,\u00a0with a high forecast of\u00a0$10.40\u00a0and a low forecast of\u00a0$4.00. The average price target represents 26.05% upside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Li Auto and NIO Stock\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s quadrupling of tariffs on Chinese-made EVs doesn\u2019t change my position on these two companies. As neither company operates in the U.S., the impact will be nominal. I remain bullish on Li Auto despite its inauspicious start to the year and neutral on NIO.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Consumer interest in EVs just dropped for the first time in 3 years",
        "content": "A new report from automotive research firm J.D. Power noted fading EV interest from American consumers.\n\nFor the first time since J.D. Power began its Electric Vehicle Consideration (EVC) Study in 2021, EV buying sentiment has dropped.\n\nThe latest edition of the study revealed that 24% of respondents say they are \u201cvery likely\u201d to consider purchasing an EV, down from 26% a year ago.\n\nIn addition, the percentage of shoppers who say they are \u201coverall likely\u201d to consider purchasing an EV decreased to 58% from 61% last year.\n\nAccording to the survey, the decline in enthusiasm for EVs can be traced to charging. Or a lack thereof.\n\nAmong shoppers who say they are \u201csomewhat unlikely\u201d or \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to consider an EV, J.D. Power said 52% cited a \u201clack of charging station availability\u201d as a reason for rejection \u2014 the highest proportion in the study. And these concerns about charging availability have risen, up 3% from a year ago.\n\nChief among those concerns is likely what\u2019s happening with Tesla\u2019s Supercharger Network, the country\u2019s largest.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla CEO Elon Musk laid off nearly the entire Supercharger organization, which was responsible for the build-out of its best-in-class charging network.\n\nMusk then backtracked on his initial stance and is promising to invest in growing the network, but the optics of the move certainly won\u2019t help charging availability concerns. The company has since begun hiring some of these folks back.\n\nAutomakers like GM, Ford, Kia, Polestar, Stellantis, Honda, and others had signed up to access the Supercharger network, and incorporate Tesla\u2019s NACS plug inlet in their future vehicles, under the promise that the Supercharger network would continue to grow at a steady pace. A vehicle charges at a Tesla Supercharger station in Detroit, Nov. 16, 2022. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut the changing EV sentiment is more than just the grappling with public charging infrastructure. The J.D. Power survey found that overall higher prices for EVs, limited driving distance (range anxiety!), long charging times, and inability to charge at both home or work were also main concerns.\n\nJ.D. Power says more education about incentives like tax credits will help boost sales, but much work still needs to be done on the part of automakers, and perhaps the federal government, which has bet heavily on EV adoption in the country.\n\n\u201cAs understanding of EV incentives rises, so does the likelihood of consideration. However, approximately 40% of shoppers say they do not have a solid understanding of such incentives,\u201d said Stewart Stropp, J.D. Power\u2019s executive director of EV intelligence. \u201cPrioritizing initiatives and efforts to educate consumers about the EV proposition \u2014 including available incentives and how they work \u2014 is vital to accelerating market growth.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nState and federal tax credits are certainly helping to make EVs more affordabile, but at the moment only 15 full EVs qualify for full or partial federal tax credits. Many Americans are likely unaware that any EV sold in America, regardless of country of production or battery sourcing requirements, can get the full federal tax credit of $7,500 if purchased through lease.\n\nNevertheless, cost considerations led to automakers adding incentives and cutting prices of EVs to boost sales. Even Tesla earlier this month started offering 0.99% financing for new Model Y purchases for a limited time.\n\nPerhaps suprisingly, even younger generations of buyers, who typically are in favor of new technology and greener transportation options, also expressed diminishing EV enthusiasm in the J.D. Power survey.\n\n\u201cThe lack of affordable EV models is affecting the two youngest buyer cohorts, Gen Z and Gen Y, with \u2018very likely\u2019 consideration down 2 and 5 percentage points year over year, respectively,\u201d J.D. Power said.\n\nStill, those cohorts do offer the most optimism for EV consideration, with 24% of Gen Z and 32% of Gen Y (Millennial) shoppers claiming they are \u201cvery likely\u201d to consider an EV, more than the other generational cohorts J.D. Power surveyed.\n\nJ.D. Power\u2019s data comes via responses from 8,179 consumers, and was conducted from January through April 2024.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Broker-Favored Auto Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio Now",
        "content": "In the fast-paced world of investment, broker recommendations serve as guiding beacons. Their assessments not only offer insights but also carry significant weight, influencing market sentiment and investor decisions. These brokers diligently revise their earnings estimates, weighing the potential upsides and downsides of the stocks they analyze.\n\nIn this article, we delve into three auto stocks \u2014 Blue Bird Corp BLBD, General Motors GM and Dorman Products DORM \u2014 that have garnered favor from brokers and would be worth investing in now to reap handsome rewards. Each stock boasts strong fundamentals, promising growth trajectories and the confidence of broker consensus. They have an attractive\u00a0average broker recommendation (\"ABR\") on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell) and are witnessing upward earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAuto Stocks Finding Favor With Brokers\n\nBlue Bird: A prominent manufacturer of school buses and related parts, the company is a leader in alternative power. Six of the seven brokers covering BLBD stock have Strong Buy recommendations, giving the company an attractive ABR of 1.14. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBlue Bird is trading close to its 52-week high of $54.26/share and has rocketed around 96% so far this year. With a robust market demand and an order backlog of approximately 5,900 units valued at around $850 million, Blue Bird is experiencing notable growth. Initiatives like product enhancements for EVs, new safety features, complexity reduction and quality improvements are contributing to its success. Manageable debt and sufficient liquidity add to its strengths. Significant improvements in pricing, EV mix and parts sales resulted in record results for the first half of fiscal year 2024, prompting Blue Bird to raise its forecasts for the year.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Blue Bird\u2019s fiscal 2024 and 2025 sales implies year-over-year growth of 17.3% and 13%, respectively. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed earnings estimates on all occasions, the average surprise being 92.4%. The consensus mark for EPS implies year-over-year growth of 140% and 2%, respectively. BLBD is witnessing northbound estimate revisions for the current and next fiscal year.

Out of the 23 brokers covering GM stock, 14 have Strong Buy recommendations. Including one Buy rating, seven Hold ratings and one Strong Sell Rating, General Motors\u2019 ABR of 1.83 is still favorable.\n\nStory continues\n\nGM has surged roughly 26% year to date and is currently trading at around $45/share, with the possibility of more upside. The Zacks average price target of $52.6/share suggests a nearly 17% upside for the stock from the current levels. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGeneral Motors\u2019 compelling EV and ICE portfolio, with strong demand for its quality pickups and full-size SUVs, bodes well for delivery growth. The company is swiftly advancing in its electrification journey, bolstered by a remarkable 300% surge in battery module production over the last six months. Its cost-reduction efforts, superior liquidity profile (total automotive liquidity of $33.3 billion as of Mar 31, 2024) and investor-friendly moves also instill confidence. GM is also attractively valued, trading at forward earnings multiple of 4.82, below its median of 6.02 over the last five years. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGM currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\u00a0The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors\u2019 2024 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 1.7% and 22.4%, respectively.

Of the three brokers covering Dorman Products stock, two have a Strong Buy rating and the other has a Hold rating, with the ABR being 1.67.\u00a0The stock has risen roughly 11% so far this year and seemingly has more upside. The Zacks average price target of $108.67 is still 17% above the current levels. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDorman consistently expands its product line, introducing hundreds of new direct replacement parts and assemblies designed to match or improve upon the performance of original equipment. In 2023, the company reached record annual sales of $1.93 billion, marking a 13% increase year over year. The acquisition of Super ATV has significantly boosted the company's overall prospects. Dorman's dedication to regular product launches and ongoing innovation fuels its sustained growth. With a strong balance sheet, a manageable debt-to-capitalization ratio of 29% (compared to the industry average of 42%) and ample liquidity, Dorman is well-poised for success. Investor-friendly moves via share buybacks further instill confidence.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dorman Products\u2019 2024 and 2025 sales implies year-over-year growth of 4% and 5%, respectively.

        "title": "Is Blue Bird (BLBD) Outperforming Other Auto-Tires-Trucks Stocks This Year?",
        "content": "For those looking to find strong Auto-Tires-Trucks stocks, it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are outperforming their peers. Has Blue Bird (BLBD) been one of those stocks this year? A quick glance at the company's year-to-date performance in comparison to the rest of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector should help us answer this question.\n\nBlue Bird is a member of our Auto-Tires-Trucks group, which includes 108 different companies and currently sits at #16 in the Zacks Sector Rank.

        "title": "Blue Bird Corporation (BLBD) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Blue Bird (BLBD)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 54.8% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $54.26 in the previous session. Blue Bird has gained 96.5% since the start of the year compared to the -13.3% move for the Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector and the -23.9% return for the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 8, 2024, Blue Bird reported EPS of $0.89 versus consensus estimate of $0.43 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 9.81%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Blue Bird is expected to post earnings of $2.73 per share on $1.33 billion in revenues. This represents a 155.14% change in EPS on a 17.29% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $2.90 per share on $1.5 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 6.35% and 12.9%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nBlue Bird may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nBlue Bird has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 19.4X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 13.1X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 35.1X versus its peer group's average of 8X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.39. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Blue Bird currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Blue Bird meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Blue Bird shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.\n\nHow Does BLBD Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of BLBD have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is General Motors Company (GM). GM has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of C, and a Momentum Score of B.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. General Motors Company beat our consensus estimate by 25.96%, and for the current fiscal year, GM is expected to post earnings of $9.40 per share on revenue of $174.72 billion.\n\nShares of General Motors Company have gained 7.1% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 4.84X and a P/CF of 2.33X.\n\nThe Automotive - Domestic industry is in the top 25% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for BLBD and GM, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Auto Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for May 2024",
        "content": "It\u2019s safe to say that the stock market needs a push following a breather. After a breathtaking rally in tech stocks over the past year, the market\u2019s taken a moment to pause. However, we saw the market gaining momentum again, and perhaps the cherry on top was the return of the infamous \u2018Roaring Kitty,\u2019 who effectively revitalized the meme stock mania. Hence, against this backdrop, I feel it\u2019s best to consider exposure to the top auto stocks to buy again.\n\nAuto stocks were far from the best performers in 2023, having been weighed down by multiple headwinds. Heightened interest rates and the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike added to the uncertainty, limiting the upside potential. However, with the UAW obstacle cleared out and the likelihood of a couple of rate cuts this year, betting on auto stocks to buy would be a wise move at this point. Here are three that deserve your attention.\n\nAuto Stocks to Buy: General Motors (GM) GM stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a legacy automaker with a rich history of being one of the North American auto market bellwethers. Hence, we\u2019ve seen it weather many storms over the past several years, consistently coming out on top. Moreover, it\u2019s been committed to an all-electric future in recent years, investing north of $35 billion in EV and AV development through 2025. Nonetheless, while its long-term focus is centered on EVs, its internal combustion engine (ICE) business continues to provide a solid foundation. Its multi-pronged approach has effectively shielded it from the EV market downturn, with its stock up 40% last year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, GM remains an excellent pick from a financial perspective. Despite operating in an unconducive market, it has handily beaten estimates across both lines in the past six quarters. \u00a0Its most recent earnings print\u00a0showed a 7.6% increase in sales to $43 billion on a year-over-year (YOY) basis, while its superb EPS of $2.62 blew past estimates by 50 cents.\u00a0 Moreover, its management upped its adjusted free cash flow expectations to $8.5 billion to $10.5 billion, providing ample coverage for its shareholder rewards.\n\nStellantis N.V. (STLA) Stellantis (STLA) logo at the transmission factory. The Stellantis subsidiaries of FCA are Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nStellantis (NYSE:STLA)\u00a0is another formidable force in the automotive sphere. Formed following a 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, STLA stock has been a remarkably rewarding investment. To illustrate my point, STLA stock has offered a 61% 3-year return compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 33% return. Its success has a lot to do with the pent-up vehicle demand post-pandemic and the company\u2019s focus on top-and-bottom-line expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\n2023 was a smashing year\u00a0for the business, posting a 5% jump in sales to $204.5 million and a 5% increase in adjusted EPS to $6.93. Moreover, despite the headwinds from the UAW strike, it generated robust free cash flows of $13.9 billion. Additionally, it returned 51% of those cash flows in dividends and buybacks. As we advance, the firm is committed to achieving at least a double-digit\u00a0adjusted operation margin on upwards of \u20ac190 billion in sales.\n\nWith all that growth, you can scoop up STLA stock\u00a0for just 0.42 time\u2019s forward sales estimates, 52% behind the sector median.\n\nBYD (BYDDF) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\n\u2018Tesla Killer\u2019 BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) is a leading Chinese EV manufacturer\u00a0that is most befitting of\u00a0the \u2018strong buy\u2019 EV stocks to buy tag.\u00a0It has leapfrogged its completion in the past year, outperforming EV pioneer Tesla in becoming the top company in the niche. It delivered 936,446 total passenger vehicle deliveries year-to-date (YTD), head-and-shoulders above its peers. EV sales made up roughly 18% of these deliveries, which continues to rise each quarter.\n\nDespite its tremendous progress, there\u2019s more to come for BYD. The company recently announced its flagship \u201cShark\u201d pickup truck, set to rival the Tesla Cybertruck. Additionally, BYD is also hot on the heels of Tesla on the autonomous driving front, having launched an AI-powered solution earlier in the year. Moreover, BYD is advancing its cutting-edge battery technology with a hefty $1.4 billion investment in a sodium-ion battery plant. These batteries are much smaller and more affordable EV batteries than lithium-ion alternatives.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "5 Valuable Price-to-Book Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio",
        "content": "In value investing, it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong. There are a number of investment styles to suit the predilection of hundreds of investors looking for the best value stocks.\n\nAmong them, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is an easy-to-use tool for identifying low-priced stocks with high growth prospects.\n\nThe P/B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.\n\nP/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.\n\nThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company GM, Qifu Technology QFIN, The ODP Corporation ODP, Tri Pointe Homes TPH and Gray Television GTN are some such stocks.\n\nNow, let us understand the concept of book value.\n\nWhat is Book Value?\n\nThere are several ways by which book value can be defined.\u00a0Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company\u2019s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.\n\nIt is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders\u2019 equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company\u2019s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.\n\nUnderstanding P/B Ratio\n\nBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.\n\nA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.\n\nFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.\n\nBut there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock\u2019s price may be significantly high \u2014 thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one \u2014 in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.\n\nIn any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.\n\nPrice to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company\u2019s sales/revenues \u2014 a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.\n\nPrice to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share \u2014 a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.\n\nPEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.\n\nCurrent Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\n\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\n\nValue Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.\n\nHere are five of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nHeadquartered in Detroit,\u00a0General Motors is one of the world\u2019s largest automakers.

        "title": "In a single night, self-driving startup Cruise went from sizzling startup to cautionary tale. Here\u2019s what really happened\u2014and how GM is scrambling to save its $10B bet",
        "content": "October 2 was a quiet night on the streets of San Francisco. It was moderately cloudy, and Fleet Week activities had just begun at Sunset Library. But in the Tenderloin neighborhood, at 9:29pm, a pedestrian stepped out into the street, crossing 5th and Market, and was struck by a green Nissan Sentra sedan. What happened next would ripple all the way through one of the largest corporations on earth\u2014GM.\n\nBecause after the woman was struck the first time, \u201cPanini\u201d\u2014one of the self-driving robo-taxis in Cruise\u2019s fleet that had been out on the streets for about a year and a half\u2014ran over her, stopped, then dragged the woman for 20 feet as it tried to pull over.\n\nWithin seconds of the initial impact, Cruise\u2019s control room in Scottsdale, Az.\u2014where hourly agents monitored Cruise\u2019s fleet 24 hours a day in cubicles fitted with three computer screens\u2014was looped in. By the time a live three-second video of the incident transmitted onto the computer screens in front of Cruise\u2019s remote assistance agents, the car had already incorrectly labeled the incident as a side collision and begun to pull over, unaware it was dragging a human body beneath its wheels.\n\nAn exhaustive internal investigation reconstructed nearly every detail of the accident, but it couldn\u2019t clear up exactly what Cruise\u2019s remote assistance team saw that evening. One thing is certain: The incident was the most serious in Cruise\u2019s history, and it immediately thrust the robo-taxi company and its 80% owner, General Motors, into a spiral of federal scrutiny and investigations as well as public outrage and condemnation.\n\nBefore the end of October 2023, regulators were alleging that Cruise had withheld important details of the incident from them. California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles had rescinded Cruise\u2019s operational permit, leading Cruise to voluntarily pull its vehicles off the streets across the U.S. GM\u2014which had largely let the company run independently, despite its close communication with senior leadership and operations\u2014swept in to replace nearly all of Cruise\u2019s management, shuffle up its board, and lay off nearly a quarter of its almost 4,000 employees in a bid to salvage Cruise\u2019s reputation and preserve the more than $10 billion that GM has plowed into the company over the last eight years.\n\nCruise\u2014once a crown jewel within General Motors CEO and Cruise Chair Mary Barra\u2019s broader strategy to rival electric competitor Tesla\u2014suddenly had become an outsized liability, just as General Motors was simultaneously trying to manage the six-week union strike by workers of the Big Three U.S. automakers that was threatening its business. Those labor strikes were unprecedented, but the revelations around Cruise\u2019s back-and-forth with regulators were also unnerving GM shareholders. As a financial analyst put it during GM\u2019s first earnings call that mentioned Cruise\u2019s permit being revoked, the company's handling of the whole debacle was very \u201cun-GM like.\u201d \u201cI agree with you,\u201d Barra responded. \u201cIt was uncharacteristic, and it definitely is something that we're working to manage well,\u201d she said.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut unlike a startup that implodes then closes its doors, GM is unfurling the full force of a Fortune 500 giant to resuscitate the project. Whereas GM had previously taken more of a backseat approach with Cruise, it is now intimately hands-on in its subsidiary\u2019s day-to-day\u2014and in the sensitive task of rolling Cruise robo-taxis back onto the streets. To report this story, Fortune spoke with eleven former Cruise employees or contract workers, in addition to Cruise investors, analysts, and San Francisco politicians. Fortune also interviewed Cruise\u2019s newly-appointed Chief Safety Officer, Steve Kenner. What is clear? The moves GM and Cruise\u2019s new leadership team make next will be a roadmap of how a giant corporation can rescue an innovative startup\u2014or be driven off course trying to save it.\n\n\u2018I can't stop smiling\u2019\n\nTwo years ago, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, sporting a black leather jacket, peered into the window of white and orange Chevvy Bolt that was pulling up to the curb to pick her up\u2014no driver in sight.\n\n\u201cOh my gosh. This is incredible,\u201d Barra said after sliding into the back seat of the Cruise robo-taxi, known by Cruise staffers as \u201cTostada.\u201d Barra was sitting next to Kyle Vogt, cofounder of Cruise and its then-president and Chief Technology Officer. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that we have to wear masks though, because I can\u2019t stop smiling,\u201d Barra said.\n\nThe video, which Barra posted on her LinkedIn two years ago, showed her taking her first Cruise ride, though she had already been talking up its technology for years\u2014ever since General Motors had scooped up a majority of the startup\u2019s shares in March 2016, and two years later when she became Chair of its board. The acquisition, which was for a combination of cash and GM equity, put the fledgling company at $1 billion when it was still just three years old and cemented Vogt as a two-time billion-dollar exit founder\u2014and made him and Cruise cofounder Dan Kan the youngest-ever senior directors at General Motors.\n\nVogt, who had built his first self-driving car prototype at the age of 13, had a small team of just 40 engineers when GM pulled it into the fold, but it quickly became an outsized piece of GM\u2019s strategy as it experimented with rideshare and autonomy. GM had already made a strategic investment in Lyft, and in early 2016, it had launched its own car sharing program called Maven, though it would shut that down during the pandemic.\n\nImportantly, Cruise would become an integral piece of GM\u2019s broader big-vision strategy to go 100% electric by 2035. Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla had left legacy carmakers like General Motors in the dust. While General Motors had been working on manufacturing EVs since the 90s, GM had struggled to manufacture electric vehicles en masse, and in 2022, had to recall many of its Chevy Bolt EVs over fire risks. Even if President Biden was publicly trying to give General Motors most of the credit for the EV revolution, it was Tesla that was successfully putting millions of cars on the streets\u2014and it was being rewarded by investors accordingly.\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\nCruise\u2019s promise of self-driving vehicles was the kind of shiny new technology that could give General Motors an edge and differentiate it in the market\u2014and maybe even make the legacy automaker \u201ccool.\u201d GM plowed $592 million into the company in 2017, doubling its staff within the first year of GM\u2019s acquisition. Within eight years, Cruise had scaled to nearly 4,000 employees (plus a host of contract workers) across San Francisco, Seattle, Phoenix, Austin, Dubai, and in Japan. In 2022, Cruise beat Tesla and Alphabet's Waymo to commercial operation, becoming the first company to launch a fared robo-taxi service in San Francisco that February. Cruise welcomed strategic investors like Honda and Microsoft. It was building out a driverless last-mile delivery service with Walmart in Phoenix and had 70 of its robo-taxis on the road in San Francisco by the end of 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are the first company that has actually deployed an autonomous rideshare company service in San Francisco,\u201d Barra told Fortune of Cruise in an interview in Aug. 2022. \u201cWe're actually charging for rides and there is no driver\u2026 So I'm very excited about where our technology is. So that's huge.\u201d\n\nAbout a year before Barra took that first ride, there was an executive shuffle within Cruise. GM veteran Dan Ammann, who had once rivaled Barra for the top seat at GM and had been chief executive at Cruise since 2019, was replaced by Vogt, and he left the company at the end of 2021. Ammann and Barra had sparred over when Cruise should go public, which was first reported by Bloomberg and independently confirmed by Fortune.\u00a0(Ammann didn't respond to Fortune's request for comment.)\n\nWithin two months after Ammann had left the company, Cruise was rolling its cars onto the road in San Francisco, leading to internal clashes among some of its own employees, who debated whether the technology was accurate enough to roll out en masse. These clashes would only heighten in 2023 when the company started scaling at a rapid clip.\n\n\u201cThese vehicles were not ready. And we would say as much,\u201d one of the former employees says, noting that they believed that the number of \u201cunwanted public interactions\u201d\u2014or UPIs\u2014on the company\u2019s internal database called \u201cRINO,\u201d were too high. The former employee described instances of vehicles freezing in the middle of a four-way stop or stopping when an emergency vehicle would go past it, and said that the robo taxis couldn\u2019t see objects that were too close to the ground\u2014recalling staffers joking about how a Cruise might run over Mayor London Breed\u2019s cat, because the robo taxi wouldn\u2019t be able to detect it.\u00a0 \u201cI believe that we were getting close\u2014I just think that we tried it a little bit too early when there were things that were unsafe,\u201d a separate former employee says, noting how isolated vehicle responses, such as a Cruise not stopping quickly enough at a stop sign, was akin to \u201cif a computer had a learner's permit.\u201d In 2022, Cruise beat Tesla and Google\u2019s Waymo to operation, becoming the first company to launch a commercial robo taxi service in San Francisco that February.\n\nThere was a notable shift at Cruise particularly in 2023, when Vogt became laser-focused on scale, according to people who worked there at the time. One person says that the company set an internal goal to reach $150 million in annual revenue by the end of the year. \u201cDeployment decisions were basically being made on-the-fly at night by [Kyle Vogt],\u201d that person asserts.\u00a0(Vogt declined to comment for this story)\n\nBut the subject of readiness was contested internally\u2014particularly when Cruise was first launching service, and only had a few vehicles on the road. A former employee said the vehicles were \u201cthoroughly tested\u201d when they were first debuted for commercial service in 2022 in San Francisco. They described the lengthy process that led up to the rollout: Running billions of miles of simulations in what was called \u201cthe matrix,\u201d testing on private road systems, and tens of thousands of miles with human drivers\u2014all of which preceded the rollout. After the cars were rolled out in 2022, small issues would lead to a reduction in fleet size, or trigger a full fleet stoppage, they said.\n\nBut as more and more cars were introduced to the streets, Cruise was often at odds with the public in San Francisco, who didn\u2019t seem quite ready for the new technology to be on the streets. People would mess with the cars\u2014putting traffic cones on top of the vehicles so the robo taxis would pull over, or throwing rocks at the windshields. One remote assistance operator recalled a man pulling down his pants and sitting his naked bottom on the hood of the robo-taxi while she was trying to move the vehicle. \u201cA lot of people didn't want Cruise to exist and would make a joke out of it,\u201d a former employee says. Another former employee recalled people slashing Cruise tires and a man who repeatedly chased the cars with a hatchet, sometimes when passengers were inside.\n\nAnd Cruise\u2019s relationship with regulators was at times contentious. The city and county of San Francisco was repeatedly laying out complaints of driverless Cruise cars sitting disabled and blocking traffic, signaling in one direction yet moving in another, or blocking transit vehicles. In summer 2023, head of the SFMTA Jeff Tumlin went on a podcast, berating companies like Cruise and Waymo and making statements about the data they shared with regulators that were inaccurate (The podcast ultimately issue a factual correction around some of Tumlin\u2019s statements of how AV companies were engaging with his agency).\n\nThere was an \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality that ran through the fabric of the organization, according to the internal investigation after the October incident, which was made public earlier this year, and accounts from former employees. Two former employees said senior leadership was resistant to working with San Francisco law enforcement and regulators.\n\nThat attitude extended to the media. Employees expressed frustration at the frequent negative media coverage or political jabs lodged at Cruise, and said some staffers took it personally.\n\n\u201cKyle was very passionate about what we do here at Cruise,\u201d one of the former employees says. \u201cHe would talk all the time, at length, of drunk driving accidents and the amount of people who are killed every single year. He mentioned almost every single company stand-up meeting that we had\u2014just to try and drive the point home that we can make a safer world by what we do here.\u201d\n\n\u2018It was hard to watch\u2019\n\nFor San Franciscans trying out the new, Cruise robo-taxi service for the first time, the whole process could feel futuristic. A user pulls up the app, orders a Cruise car with a clever name\u2014like \u201cPoppy\u201d\u2014and it pulls up to the curb. After getting in, a tablet in the back instructs you to shut the doors, then Poppy takes you on your way.\n\nPowering all of it was a lot of hidden manpower to make sure the vehicles stayed out of trouble. That\u2019s where the staff in Scottsdale came in. When the fleet was operational, that office housed Cruise\u2019s operations center, with a customer service team, an incident and crisis management team, and roadside dispatch.\n\nOne of the rooms is a 24/7 control room, where remote assistance workers worked 10 hours a day, four days a week, monitoring both the autonomous fleet\u2014suggesting routes for the taxis when they got stuck or didn\u2019t know how to proceed\u2014but also monitoring the vehicles that were being operated with drivers. If a driver took their hands off the steering wheel, or started blinking too slowly (indicating tiredness), the remote assistance workers would alert their supervisors.\n\nThe mood in the control room was generally light-hearted, two former agents say. In true Silicon Valley startup fashion, Cruise\u2019s office offered free meals to its employees\u2014with chips, energy drinks, oatmeal, and candy for them to snack on from two kitchens during their shifts. Managers would crack jokes. \u201cI thought it was fun,\u201d one of them says. \u201cEverybody was nice. Everyone was wanting to help you.\u201d\n\nBut the evening of Oct. 2, after the pedestrian had been struck by a Cruise vehicle, the aura in the control room shifted markedly. No formal announcement about the crash was made within the control room, according to the agent present, though a longer, 14-second video of the accident was shared with some of the people present via Slack, or shown directly\u2014alerting others to what had taken place, they said.\n\nOne of the agents working that evening, who spoke with Fortune on condition of anonymity, left the control room for a period after being shown the footage. \u201cI just took a walk\u2014just to get my mind off of it\u2014because it was hard to watch,\u201d they said. (Cruise says that all RA employees involved in the response \u201cwere given the opportunity to go home to cope with the experience.\u201d)\n\nThat evening, Cruise team members jumped into crisis management mode, paging employees who needed to be looped in and creating a virtual \u201cWar Room\u201d on Google Meet and a corresponding Slack Channel to communicate about and deal with the incident. Meanwhile, employees went back-and-forth with the NHTSA, the San Francisco MTA, San Francisco Police Department, and San Francisco Fire Department about the incident and set up meetings for the following day. Cruise was fielding inquiries from the press and was solely focused on trying to correct the record to reflect that the pedestrian had initially been struck by a separate vehicle in a hit-and-run\u2014not by Panini.\n\nEmployees didn\u2019t know the extent of the robo taxi\u2019s responsibility in the accident\u2014that the vehicle had subsequently dragged the pedestrian 20 feet after she was struck by the other vehicle\u2014until early the morning of Oct. 3, when the complete footage from the car had been uploaded to Cruise servers and reviewed. At that point, employees realized the incident was much more serious than they realized, and some 200 people at the company were pulled into the virtual \u201cWar Room.\u201d\n\nBut Vogt and Cruise\u2019s vice president of communications, Aaron McLear, decided not to alter Cruise\u2019s press statement to include that Panini had dragged the pedestrian, nor share the full footage with reporters. \u201c[W]e did share all the info with all of our regulators and the investigators. We have no obligation to share anything with the press,\u201d McLear wrote in a Slack message, according to Cruise\u2019s subsequent third-party investigation of the incident which GM made public earlier this year. (McLear declined to comment)\n\nIn meetings with regulators on Oct. 3 however, Cruise employees didn\u2019t proactively discuss how its robo-taxi had dragged the pedestrian\u2014instead relying on playing a full video of the incident, which showed the dragging, to speak for itself. And there were internet issues in all but one of the meetings with regulators\u2014limiting what exactly officials saw and creating a disconnect in what regulators took away from the meetings, the investigation showed.\n\nAdding to what had already been such a difficult week for the company and many of its employees, one of Cruise\u2019s incident analysts had suddenly passed away a few days before the pedestrian accident, leading Cruise to bring in counselors and offer time off to the employees who were close to him. Around that same time, one of Cruise\u2019s contract drivers, who was manually driving a robo-taxi in one of the new cities, was t-boned by a speeding driver and hospitalized with significant injuries. \u201cThat was a crazy week at Cruise\u2013I\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d says someone who worked in the Scottsdale operations center.\n\nMeanwhile, Vogt was pressing for things to return to normal, according to the investigation that followed the incident. When members of the safety and engineering teams asked whether the fleet should be grounded, Vogt and Cruise COO Gil West said the data didn't justify a shutdown, the report says. And, to the concern of several Cruise staffers, Vogt and West determined to end the \u201cWar Room\u201d by 6:05p.m, the day after the incident. Employees \"expressed concern that there were no further scheduled [crisis management team] meetings for the biggest accident Cruise had faced in its history,\" the report says. People were \u201clivid,\u201d an employee says.\n\n\"It was uncharacteristic, and it definitely is something that we're working to manage well,\"\n\nMary Barra, CEO of General Motors and Chair of Cruise's Board of Directors\n\nOn Oct. 6, an article ran in Forbes in which San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin accused Cruise of \u201ctelling a half truth,\u201d and not disclosing that the robo-taxi had dragged the pedestrian 20 feet. Four days later, the DMV asked for a complete video of the accident, and a couple days after, the NHTSA told Cruise it intended to open a \u201cpreliminary evaluation\u201d into the accident as well as three other incidents involving pedestrians in San Francisco.\n\nOn Oct. 24, the DMV suspended Cruise\u2019s driverless permit, noting in a release that the Department believed Cruise vehicles were \u201cnot safe for the public\u2019s operation\u201d and that the company had \u201cmisrepresented any information related to safety of the autonomous technology of its vehicles.\u201d The DMV rescinded Cruise\u2019s permit the very same day that Barra had earlier underscored Cruise\u2019s expansion plans on an earnings call with analysts. Shortly after, Cruise voluntarily pulled its entire fleet off the streets across the U.S., including its human-driven cars. Vogt resigned, and cofounder Dan Kan, the Chief Product Officer, resigned a day later.\n\nThe company brought in Quinn Emanuel, a legal firm to investigate the incident, which determined that Cruise had suffered from \u201cpoor leadership, mistakes in judgment, lack of coordination, an \u2018us versus them\u2019 mentality with regulators, and a fundamental misapprehension of Cruise\u2019s obligations of accountability and transparency to the government and the public.\u201d After the findings, Cruise parted ways with nine employees and senior leaders, and completely cleaned house, bringing on a slew of new executives.\n\nBut even after Quinn Emanuel\u2019s 105-page report, questions remain about what exactly happened that night. Two operators were interviewed about a week after the incident and asked to share their recollection of events, according to Cruise\u2019s subsequent investigation.\u00a0 But they had been laid off by the time Quinn Emanuel sought to interview them and the investigators had to rely on a Cruise staffer\u2019s \u201ccontemporaneous notes.\u201d Another two interviewees provided information the law firm couldn\u2019t verify that \u201cappears contrary to the weight of the evidence,\u201d the report said.\u00a0 The agent working that evening who spoke to Fortune, who was laid off in November, said no one at Cruise had ever reached out to them about the incident. \"There's a lot of stuff lost now that people will never know,\" another former employee says.\n\nA representative from Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, where the pedestrian was taken in critical condition, said that the pedestrian had been discharged, but declined to share any further information. The San Francisco Police Department said its investigation into the incident is still ongoing.\n\nCruise settled with the woman who was dragged at a figure between $8 million to $12 million, Fortune reported earlier this week. The company has also proposed a fine of $112,500 as part of a settlement with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which had accused the company of omitting material facts to the regulator. The Cruise \"Origin\" vehicles, spacious van-like vehicles built by GM for Cruise, were being tested in Austin before Cruise pulled its vehicles off the streets last fall. Cruise is keeping them off the streets for now.\n\nAfter October 2nd\n\nGM has always been close to Cruise\u2019s operations. GM controls the Cruise board (Of its seven seats, four are GM executives and three also sit on GM\u2019s board.) And particularly after Ammann\u2019s departure, GM\u2019s relationship with Cruise\u2019s senior leadership became more closely intertwined, according two people familiar with the matter. GM executives Regina Carto, who leads global product safety, and Frank Gorman, GM\u2019s assistant general counsel, had regularly-scheduled meetings with several of Cruise\u2019s senior leaders, one person with knowledge of the matters says. Meanwhile, Cruise\u2019s AV technicians were regularly in touch with GM engineers to handle issues or updates with the Chevy Bolt. Cruise Origins, the spacious, van-like vehicles without driver\u2019s seats, steering wheels, or pedals, would be tested at GM\u2019s headquarters in Detroit, as well as one of their test tracks outside of San Francisco. Cruise frequently provided mileage reports to the board and other senior managers within GM, and it would report all major incidents, including how they were handled and how Cruise planned to improve its response moving forward. \u201cSomeone had some form of daily contact [with GM] on some level,\u201d one former employee says.\n\nTwo people specifically described an \"undertone\" within the company that GM was monitoring them. \"There was a constant undertone that GM was watching. GM expects us to produce. We have to get on the road. Waymo is better than us,\u201d one of them says, referring to Alphabet's rival self-driving cars.\n\nStill, Cruise had other investors, and GM had left it to operate independently, trusting its senior executive team to handle day-to-day operations, including its interactions with regulatory agencies, legal affairs, and communications.\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\nAfter the incident, when GM shares dipped below $30 per share for the first time in three years, all of that would change. While Cruise EVP Mo Elshenawy was promoted to be the company\u2019s co-president and CTO, board member Glidden stepped in as co-president and Chief Administrative Officer, and GM became acutely involved in investigating the October incident, restructuring the company and who was running it, and overseeing its interactions with the media. For example, GM\u2019s Chief Communication Officer and other senior GM leaders started to sometimes sit in on Cruise board meetings, according to someone familiar with the matter. GM board member Jon McNeill, who was Lyft\u2019s former COO, stepped onto Cruise's board, and Mike Abbott, GM\u2019s executive vice president of software and services, took an observer seat. GM\u2019s president, Mark Reuss, personally interviewed Steve Kenner, previously the global director of automotive safety at Ford who was hired as Cruise\u2019s Chief Safety Officer earlier this year. Glidden, who is GM's executive vice president of legal, has been representing the company in its ongoing regulatory inquiries (His base salary rose to $1.1 million, up from $850,000 as a result, SEC filings show).\n\nIn the weeks after the DMV\u2019s suspension, Cruise employees were anxious\u2014particularly after Vogt resigned. \u201c[We] started to see the writing on the wall,\u201d one of the employees says, referring to discussions of potential layoffs. \u201cA lot of people just were really nervous.\u201d\n\nWith cars pulled from the roads in all markets, some staffers who worked directly with the fleet had little to do. Testing was moved into garages and test tracks. In the control room, remote assistance workers didn\u2019t have cars to monitor, so were asked to review and label thousands of video clips during their shifts.\n\nRight up to the DMV\u2019s suspension of Cruise\u2019s permit, Cruise had been on a fast track to scale. The robo-taxi company had publicly announced plans to get to $1 billion in revenue by 2025. It was already providing limited service in Phoenix, Austin, Houston, Dallas, and Miami\u2014and it was working on building out operations in Nashville, as well as overseas in Japan and in Dubai. Out in Phoenix, Cruise had been expanding its range of self-driving shopping delivery that it was doing with Walmart.\n\nA handful of Cruise Origins had been transported to Cruise\u2019s R&D facility and track in Phoenix, where employees had been training with them. \u201cWe were just starting to get acquainted and integrated with the Origins,\u201d says a former Cruise employee who was working with the vehicles.\n\nImmediately, all of those plans were put on hold. With autonomous vehicles off the roads, Walmart deliveries in Phoenix reverted to human drivers, then eventually stopped altogether. During a layoff in 2023, General Motors ultimately let go of 24% of Cruise\u2019s employees\u2014or around 900 people\u2014and later parted ways with many of its contractors.\n\n\"The leaders involved exercised very poor judgment in how they conducted themselves and interacted with the regulators,\"\n\nSteve Kenner, Chief Safety Officer of Cruise\n\nApproximately seven months since the incident, General Motors is just starting to lay the groundwork to relaunch. Cruise said earlier this week that it will start testing its self-driving vehicles in Phoenix\u2014operating autonomously, but with human drivers inside the vehicles to take over, if needed. At the beginning of last month, Cruise submitted responses to the California DMV to reinstate its permit, though the DMV told Fortune those are still under review. As it relaunches service, Cruise plans to re-map each city where it will operate, slowly release commercial rides with human supervision, then eventually move to autonomous rides, according to Chief Safety Officer Kenner.\n\nKenner is unsparing about Cruise\u2019s previous management. \u201cThe leaders involved exercised very poor judgment in how they conducted themselves and interacted with the regulators,\u201d he tells Fortune. Since Kenner\u2019s arrival, Cruise has restructured its operations around its safety team, so that Kenner has veto power before Cruise makes any kind of incremental rollout\u2014even if it\u2019s putting manually-driven cars on the street. He\u2019s also told regulators that GM and Cruise will work together with them on safety issues. That\u2019s already playing out in many of the meetings: All of Kenner\u2019s meetings thus far with the NHTSA, which still has two investigations open into Cruise, have included GM\u2019s head of product safety, Regina Carto, too. \u201cShe and I have been talking a lot\u2014almost on a daily basis, including just finishing up [a call] about a half hour ago,\u201d Kenner said in the interview.\n\nKenner has been traveling between Phoenix, Houston, Dallas, Austin, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., meeting with regulators and transportation officials and trying to rebuild the company\u2019s relationships. \u201cI know trust is earned, and we're going to be judged by our actions going forward,\u201d Kenner said. \u201cIt's going to take some time.\n\nBut even as Cruise robo-taxis start driving the roads again, it will be a different company than before. For one, employees are no longer awarded restricted stock units, just cash\u2014making Cruise\u2019s compensation plan more akin to that of a corporation than a Silicon Valley startup. (GM offered to buy shares at around $11-$12 per share earlier this year, according to a former employee, down from around $25 per share at the end of last year. Reuters reported similar details in February)\n\nGM has also slashed Cruise\u2019s annual budget by $1 billion and has made it clear that it will pull back the pace. As of now, Cruise is keeping its Origin vehicles off the streets.\n\nCruise\u2019s new, slower pace will make it more akin to Waymo, which had driven its vehicles 20 million miles with drivers before it started putting its cars onto the roads fully autonomously. That\u2019s something former Cruise employees who were concerned the company was moving too fast think is a good thing. \u201cThey're trying to implement some new safety initiatives which is great. It\u2019s very good to see,\u201d one of them says.\n\nCruise employees are quick to point to the data we have so far on self-driving vehicles, which both Waymo and Cruise have published, and which has been closely analyzed. The initial figures suggest that self-driving cars are much safer than their human counterparts. But new technology, it seems, is always going to be held to a much higher standard when it comes to safety.\n\n\u201cWe all see the potential benefits and value of autonomous vehicles, including safety, but we need to make sure these powerful new technologies are ready for prime time,\u201d says San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu, who through a lawsuit in December has sought to restrict the number of robo-taxis operating in San Francisco. Chiu describes himself as a supporter of self-driving cars\u2014so long as they are safe. \u201cUnfortunately the many events over the past year have suggested otherwise, so this is why we have been pushing for accountability, transparency, and guardrails.\u201d\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\n\u2018In the wilds of San Francisco\u2019\n\nPart of Cruise\u2019s original allure, executives repeatedly told shareholders, was that Cruise could recruit different talent than GM, and had an ideal lab on the streets of San Francisco. \u201cWhat really attracted us to Cruise was not only the capability that they had already developed, but the fact they were doing it, I call it, in the wilds of San Francisco, right? Literally on the downtown streets of San Francisco, the most\u2014or one of the most complex environments to try to build and deploy new technology,\u201d Pamela Fletcher, GM\u2019s former vice president of electric vehicles, said at the Citigroup Global Technology Conference in late 2016.\n\nBillions of dollars later, Cruise has lost much of what gave it that edge. It can no longer operate in the \u201cwilds of San Francisco\u201d\u2014at least for now. And it\u2019s no longer very independent from GM either. Moreover, Cruise\u2019s first-mover advantage has been erased. \u201cWhen you're standing still, and Waymo\u2019s moving forward\u2014it's a big difference,\u201d says David Whiston, an automotive analyst at Morningstar.\n\nWhen GE placed its bet on Cruise, it was hoping for all the glory that comes with getting in early on a lightning hot startup that\u2019s unconstrained by bureaucracy and tradition. But it\u2019s easy to forget the second part of the old startup mantra: \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d And in this case, a single misstep onto a dark San Francisco street didn\u2019t just put Cruise\u2019s reputation on the line, it imperiled GM\u2019s, too. Now the 100-year-old company is in a position it never wanted to be in: It has to move fast\u2014and fix things.\n\n\u2014With additional reporting from Christiaan Hetzner\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Dirt Cheap Stocks That Are Trading Below Their Book Values",
        "content": "Are you look for deeply discounted stocks to buy? One way you can find deals is by looking at stocks which are trading below their book values. Depending on the industry and the risk a company is facing, investors may not be willing to pay even book value for a stock. And in some cases, that risk is overblown, and it could make for a great buying opportunity.\n\nThree stocks that are trading below their book values today are Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC), Citigroup (NYSE: C), and General Motors (NYSE: GM). Let's take a closer look at these stocks to see if they are too risky to invest in, or if they are bargain buys.\n\n1. Kraft Heinz: 0.9 times book value\n\nKraft Heinz is a popular consumer goods company. It has many top brands in its portfolio such as Oscar Mayer and Kool-Aid, in addition to Kraft and Heinz.\n\nOver the years, however, the company has faced challenges. In 2018, it wrote down its assets to the tune of $15.4 billion. And in 2019, it also slashed its dividend. In short, the company has lost the trust of its shareholders over the years. Over a five-year period, the stock is up just 11%. The S&P 500, meanwhile, has generated returns of more than 80% during that same stretch.\n\nAnd while the company has been relying on price increases to boost its growth, that strategy may be running out of steam. In its most recent quarter, for the period ended March 30, Kraft's sales declined by 1.2% to $6.4 billion, and profits fell by 4% to $801 million. There could be more headwinds ahead for the business as inflation remains a problem, and as long as that's the case, private-label products may be more attractive to consumers than Kraft's big brands.\n\nIn the long run, however, it still may be an attractive buy. At 4.4%, the stock's high dividend yield is one of the main reasons for investing in Kraft right now. As long as you temper your expectations, this could make for a sound long-term investment.\n\n2. Citigroup: 0.6 times book value\n\nIt's not uncommon for bank stocks to trade at or around their book values. But in Citigroup's case, it's trading nowhere near its book value. Investors are hesitant with Citigroup, as the company is in the midst of a restructuring effort to become leaner and more efficient. Over the next two years, the top bank is planning to shed 20,000 jobs from a global workforce of 239,000. In 2021, the company announced it would be exiting more than a dozen consumer banking markets in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.\n\nWhile scaling down its operations may improve margins, it also limits the growth opportunities for the business in the long run. In its most recent quarter (for the first three months of 2024), the company's net income fell by 27% to less than $3.4 billion. Credit costs rose by 20%, with Citigroup incurring net credit losses of $2.3 billion during the period versus just $1.3 billion a year ago. And with potentially tougher economic conditions ahead, things may not get much easier for Citigroup as the year goes on.\n\nStory continues\n\nDown 6% in five years, Citigroup's returns have been even worse than Kraft's. While the stock does appear to be cheap, and it does pay an above-average yield of 3.3% (the S&P 500 average is 1.5%), this is another stock that investors should be careful with here. While there is a good margin of safety with the stock right now, and it too could be a good buy for the long term, investors should prepare for what could still be a bumpy ride ahead with Citigroup.\n\n3. General Motors: 0.8 times book value\n\nAutomaker General Motors rounds out this list of discounted stocks. Its five-year return of 21% is the highest of the stocks on this list, which is still far below the S&P's performance.\n\nTrading at low multiples is nothing new for the car company, as its massive debt load is a big reason investors aren't eager to pay a high price for the stock. As of the end of March, the company's total non-current liabilities (including long-term debt and other liabilities) were $114.2 billion -- more than its current assets of $106.5 billion. While GM doesn't need to worry about paying all that in the short term, it's still a risk that hovers over the company, especially as interest rates remain high.\n\nThe positive is that the business is still generating strong operating results. Last quarter, revenue totaled $43 billion and rose nearly 8% year over year. The net income of nearly $3 billion also improved by 24% from the prior-year period. However, with consumer demand potentially softening as economic conditions worsen, GM may face no shortage of challenges.\n\nWith interest rates likely to come down at some point within the next year, GM could soon become a much more attractive option to risk-averse investors.

        "title": "3 Cheap EV Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "The electric vehicle (EV) industry has seen a slump, causing many to feel skeptical about the industry\u2019s path. Some believe that the future is EV, but many others think that the current government policies may not be able to bring about any change. The sector\u00a0is facing\u00a0several obstacles, and the deliveries\u00a0haven\u2019t\u00a0been impressive.\n\nThere is an ongoing price war amongst EV makers, and despite a lower price, the deliveries\u00a0haven\u2019t\u00a0picked\u00a0pace. However, all\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0lost yet. There are a few cheap EV stocks worth considering.\n\nSome players stand apart in the crowded industry, and they have the potential to bounce back as the economy improves. The electric revolution can benefit everyone, and while the penetration of EVs is very low globally, there is potential for the industry to expand once the economy improves.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, certain EV stocks have been standing strong amidst the turmoil, and they will become one of the best industry players in a few years. Considering the current economic environment, let\u2019s examine three cheap EV stocks to buy.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nA Chinese EV maker, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI)\u00a0is one of the best EV makers right now. Since the company caters to the Chinese market, it is safe from the high tariffs implemented by the U.S. government. Its\u00a0major\u00a0market is China, and it has no plans to launch products overseas before 2025. The company impressed investors throughout 2024 with solid deliveries and strong fundamentals.\n\nHowever, due to the overall EV market slump, Li also saw a drop in sales. In April, it reported deliveries of 25,787 vehicles, up 0.4% year-over-year (YOY).\u00a0In the fourth-quarter earnings report, it\u00a0reported quarterly deliveries of 131,805 and revenue of $5.88 billion, up 136% YOY.\u00a0The company had a cash buffer of $14.6 billion and is profitable on a net profit basis.\u00a0This\u00a0is where it sets itself apart from competitors.\n\nAlso, Li Auto is known for quick execution and lower-priced models. It\u00a0is set\u00a0to launch the\u00a0Li L7 and Li L8 this month. The company\u00a0is often compared\u00a0to other Chinese EV makers. However, Li is profitable while\u00a0several\u00a0others\u00a0aren\u2019t.\n\nTrading for almost $26 today, LI stock has lost 23% value year-to-date (YTD) and 12% in the past 12 months. The stock started the year at $34 and soon hit $46. But it has been\u00a0on a downward spree\u00a0since February.\n\nStory continues\n\nTherefore, an improvement in the EV sector can boost Li stock, and the current dip is a chance to accumulate it. The company reports first-quarter results on May 20.\n\nBYD Company (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nExchanging\u00a0hands for $28, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) is up 6% YTD and has been moving\u00a0in the range of\u00a0$21 to $28.\u00a0Despite beating Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the fourth-quarter deliveries, BYDDF stock did not surge.\n\nHowever, the crown has gone back to Tesla this quarter. BYD Company reported deliveries of 300,114 passenger BEVs in the quarter. Despite the market slump, the company has reported impressive delivery numbers\u00a0which\u00a0speak of its stronghold in the market.\n\nThe deliveries surpassed expectations due to the growing expansion in multiple countries. It enjoys a pricing power that has helped the company achieve high popularity and higher sales. It reported a net profit of $631.08 million in the\u00a0first quarter, up 10.6%\u00a0while\u00a0the revenue grew by 4%.\n\nFurther, the company is\u00a0making investments for\u00a0international expansion while expanding the EV charging infrastructure. It\u00a0is planning\u00a0to choose a site for an\u00a0EV plant in\u00a0Mexico where it will\u00a0make\u00a0150,000 cars annually.\n\nHowever, the recent EV tariff announcement might\u00a0have an impact on\u00a0this decision. Recently, BYDDF launched the first mid-size hybrid pickup in Mexico.\u00a0Also, it introduced the\u00a0Sea Lion L07 in China\u00a0which\u00a0is set\u00a0to\u00a0enter Europe next year.\u00a0The company is a leader in China and will continue to dominate the market.\n\nNew launches and lower-priced models have made BYD Company one of the most popular EV makers in the world.\u00a0There is no stopping its aggressive expansion plans\u00a0and\u00a0it could beat Tesla again in the coming quarters.\u00a0The stock is a strong buy before it skyrockets to new heights.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp 24% YTD, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is exchanging hands for $45 today, and looks highly undervalued. A legacy automaker, General Motors has several years of experience in the industry\u00a0which\u00a0has helped it survive the market ups and downs.\n\nIt reported stellar first-quarter results and beat expectations. The revenue came in at $43.01 billion, a 7.6% YOY\u00a0jump\u00a0while the net income soared 26% to hit $2.95 billion.\n\nIn addition, the company is committed to its electrification goals and\u00a0is aiming\u00a0to manufacture between 200,000 to 300,000 EVs\u00a0in the year.\u00a0It\u00a0managed to deliver\u00a0441,000 units to the Chinese market in the quarter\u00a0and\u00a0about 30% of the vehicles\u00a0are sold\u00a0in China.\n\nIt aims to launch new EVs in China later this year and continue investing in the segment. While the company might be growing\u00a0at a slower pace\u00a0than other big EV names in the\u00a0industry,\u00a0these numbers are encouraging.\u00a0Despite inflation and a high-interest environment, the company has reported\u00a0strong\u00a0numbers\u00a0which\u00a0has set the momentum for the year. Also, GM stock pays dividends and has a yield of 1.07%.\n\nOne of the most resilient EV stocks in the industry, GM is a buy while it is trading below $50.

        "content": "Vehicle prices continued a downward trend in April, with the new car market slipping and used prices sliding the most of any major category in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the last year as the car market stabilizes after runaway price increases during the pandemic.\n\nUsed car prices fell 1.4% over the prior month in April and 6.9% from the prior year, data from the BLS showed on Wednesday. New car prices fell 0.4% in April and 0.4% over the prior year.\n\nCompared to their peak in February 2022, prices paid for used vehicles are now down 16.8%. Used car prices rose more than 40% annually in both June and July 2021, and again in January and February 2022. Prices for used cars and trucks are still 29% higher than in April 2019.\n\nIn April, headline CPI rose 0.3% over the previous month and 3.4% over the prior year, a deceleration from March's 0.4% month-over-month increase and 3.5% annual gain.\n\nThe Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index (MUVVI), which tracks used vehicle prices paid at wholesale on a seasonally adjusted basis in the US, ended the month of April down 2.3% month over month and down a whopping 14% from a year ago.\n\nKBB estimates Americans purchased 35.9 million used vehicles last year from dealers and private parties, just below 2022\u2019s 36.3 million. Used vehicle purchases more than doubled new retail sales last year, which KBB estimates hit 15 million vehicles.\n\nManheim also noted weakness in the EV market in April, where automakers like Tesla (TSLA) are cutting retail prices, hurting prices paid in the used market.\n\nThe firm noted that seasonally adjusted EV values last month were down 17.5% from the prior year. For non-EV cars, prices fell 13.1%.\n\nStill, KBB wrote in a report last week that lower prices aren't expected to boost auto sales figures, which have held steady in recent months.\n\nData from the BEA showed that in April, car and light truck sales came in at an annualized rate of 15.7 million vehicles, down modestly from a peak rate of 16.1 million in December. In the years before the pandemic, auto sales tended to float between an annualized rate of 17-18 million vehicles.\n\n\u201cDespite lower prices, Americans don\u2019t expect to go car shopping in high numbers anytime soon,\" KBB\u2019s Sean Tucker wrote last week.\n\n\"The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index declined 5.9% in April, as views of both the present economic situation and the near future declined. Consumer confidence was down 6.5% year over year. Plans to purchase a vehicle in the next six months declined from last month but remained higher than a year ago.\u201d\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "4 Stocks With Low Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio to Buy Now",
        "content": "Against the backdrop of elevated interest rates, underlying inflationary pressure and geopolitical uncertainties in the Middle East, the quest for stability becomes even more challenging. This pivotal juncture underscores the importance of a diversified investment approach.\r\n\r\nWe believe investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential. Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company\u2019s business.\r\n\r\nOne such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis \u2014 the lower the number, the better. KB Home KBH, Gray Television, Inc. GTN, The ODP Corporation ODP and General Motors Company GM boast a low P/CF ratio.\n\nWhy P/CF Ratio?\n\nYou must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, an important factor that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company\u2019s financial health.\r\n\r\nAnalysts caution that a company\u2019s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.\r\n\r\nA positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company\u2019s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company\u2019s liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.\r\n\r\nHowever, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.\n\nThe Bargain Hunting Strategy\n\nHere are the parameters for selecting true-value stocks:\r\n\r\nP/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.\r\n\r\nPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\r\n\r\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\r\n\r\nP/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.\r\n\r\nP/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.\r\n\r\nP/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company\u2019s sales \u2014 the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.\r\n\r\nPEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\r\n\r\nValue Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.\r\n\r\nHere are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:\r\n\r\nKB Home, one of the largest and most recognized homebuilders in the United States, sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 26.1%, on average.

It sports a Zacks Rank #1 presently. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gray Television\u2019s current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 18.4% and 477.7%, respectively, from the year-ago period.

        "title": "Here's Why General Motors (GM) is a Strong Value Stock",
        "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors alike.\n\nMany investors also have a go-to methodology that helps guide their buy and sell decisions. One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.\n\nWhy Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value Stock\n\nValue investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\nOne of the world\u2019s largest automakers, General Motors held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16.2% in 2023. Headquartered in Detroit, the auto giant has had a long and checkered history. Founded in 1908, the company rose to dominate the U.S. industry. However, hit by the financial crisis, General Motors filed for bankruptcy on Jun 1, 2009. Just within 40 days, the firm emerged from bankruptcy. In 2010, the company launched its IPO \u2013 the biggest in U.S. history at that time \u2013 and has been steadily profitable since then. From going bankrupt in 2009 to becoming one of the world\u2019s best-run car companies, General Motors has indeed come a long way.\n\nGM sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), holds a Value Style Score of A, and has a VGM Score of A. Compared to the Automotive - Domestic industry's P/E of 13.1X, shares of General Motors are trading at a forward P/E of 4.8X. GM also has a PEG Ratio of 0.5, a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 2.3X, and a Price/Sales ratio of 0.3X.\n\nMany value investors pay close attention to a company's earnings as well. For GM, eight analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.40 to $9.40 per share for 2024. Per share GM boasts an average earnings surprise of 17.8%.\n\nWith strong valuation and earnings metrics, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, investors should strongly think about adding GM to their portfolios.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Tariffs Raised on China-Made EVs: General Motors (GM) to Gain?",
        "content": "At the conclusion of what is being dubbed a 2-year investigation into Chinese practices that have caused a strain on U.S. markets, the Biden administration has announced a string of tariffs on China-made goods traded in the United States. One of the focal sectors on which this decision is going to have an impact is electric vehicles (EV).\n\nThe government, on Tuesday, raised the border tax on China-made EVs from the existing 25% to a whopping 100% in response to the undercutting of prices by China and to protect U.S. jobs. It has also raised tariffs significantly on Chinese batteries, which would ramp up the prices of the Chinese EVs even further, as these automobiles are heavily dependent on them.\n\nWhile the markets will be bracing for some sort of retaliation from China\u2019s government, which has already vowed to do so, one segment that will be making merry is U.S. EV manufacturing. The big players in the segment will have a major competitive edge in pricing their products mainly because it is becoming abundantly clear that EVs are here to stay, and demand is rising by the day. Consumers are gradually shifting from cars run on fossil fuels to their environment-friendly alternatives.\n\nNational and global players that are likely to gett a boost from this major policy move by the incumbent administration include Tesla, Inc. TSLA, Ford Motor Company F and General Motors Company GM.\n\nWhile Tesla\u2019s market share has been coming down over the past 12 months, it remained at a daunting 52% in first-quarter 2024. The second-placed Ford\u2019s sales surged 86% year over year in the same quarter. Ford\u2019s EV sales were overtaken by General Motors somewhat unexpectedly in 2023, before it staged a comeback.\n\nThe third-placed General Motors, however, has been having a stellar 2024. GM reported first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.62 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.08 and increased 18.5% year over year. Revenues of $43.01 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.28 billion and increased from $39.9 billion recorded in the year-ago period.\n\nGM\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 22.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has improved 4.4% over the past 60 days. GM currently carries a Zacks #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nGM\u2019s share price, which has risen 4.9% over the past month, has been outdoing the Zacks Automotive \u2013 Domesticindustry, which has lost 2.6% in the same period. It is also recently featured in the list of Zacks\u2019 list of most searched stocks. The time might be right to invest in the stock, which is also very competitively priced currently around the $45 mark.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nEV manufacturing in the United States will be a promising space to follow going forward with the government now on a self-proclaimed mission to boost EV manufacturing in the country. General Motors is a home-grown EV manufacturer that should be making the most of it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights General Motors and Blue Bird",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 May 15, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses General Motors GM and Blue Bird Corp. BLBD.\n\nIndustry: U.S. Auto\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2273197/shift-into-high-gear-with-these-2-domestic-auto-stocks\n\nThe near-term prospects of the Zacks Domestic Auto industry will be shaped by various factors. Vehicle sales are expected to grow this year, albeit at a slower rate compared to 2023 amid inflationary pressure, high borrowing costs and economic uncertainty. While increased labor expenses stemming from the recent UAW agreement will play a deterrent, the effects of it would be largely offset by declining input costs. Normalization of supply chains has boosted inventory levels but margins are under pressure due to heightened consumer discounts.\n\nAlthough electric vehicle (EV) sales are expected to increase this year, it will require more effort from companies to drive sales due to a slower-than-expected pace of adoption, underscoring the need for the industry to navigate evolving consumer preferences and market dynamics. Two industry participants \u2014 General Motors and Blue Bird Corp. \u2014 are well-positioned to drive gains to your portfolio.\n\nIndustry Overview\n\nThe Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry \u2014 which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people \u2014 is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through.\n\nThe widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in a fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development, and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.\n\nKey Factors at Play\n\nVehicle Sales Growth to Decelerate: New vehicle sales in the United States rose 5.1% in the first quarter of 2024 backed by strong inventory, incentives and healthy fleet volumes. The seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first quarter came in at 15.4 million, implying a year-over-year uptick of 2.7%. While vehicle sales are projected to grow in 2024, inflationary pressure, high costs of borrowing and an uncertain macro environment are expected to influence purchase decisions and slow down the pace of growth rate relative to 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nManufacturing Costs Dynamics: The UAW agreement reached in 2023 is set to raise labor costs for all automakers as the firms aim to stay competitive in attracting and retaining talent. General Motors and Ford anticipate a roughly $9 billion increase in costs over the four-year agreement period. However, excluding labor, most input costs for automakers have declined since the pandemic peak, including steel, rubber, plastics, and glass. Just that the double-digit wage hikes in the UAW contract will weigh on total costs in 2024, offsetting some of the savings from input costs deflation.\n\nAmple Inventory Aiding Sales but Ailing Margins: Post-pandemic supply chain disruptions have significantly eased, leading to a notable recovery in new vehicle inventory. According to estimates from J.D. Power and GlobalData, inventory levels reached approximately 1.7 million vehicles in March, marking a 4.2% increase from February and a 39% surge from March 2023.\n\nThis surplus inventory has prompted increased incentives and discounts for consumers, thereby addressing affordability concerns. However, these discounts are impacting the average selling price of vehicles, thereby squeezing the profit margins of firms.\n\nE-Mobility Landscape: EV sales growth in the United States is decelerating due to a slower-than-anticipated pace of customer acceptance. In the first quarter of 2024, Americans purchased 268,909 new EVs, constituting 7.3% of total new vehicle sales, a decline from the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nNonetheless, Cox Automotive projects a year-over-year increase in EV sales for 2024, aiming for roughly 10% market share by year-end. To achieve this, the EV market anticipates an influx of new models, incentives, discounts, and advertising. However, dealers will need to exert more effort to bolster sales in the face of evolving consumer preferences.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Holds Promise\n\nThe Zacks Automotive \u2013 Domestic industry is part of the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #80, which places it in the top 32% of 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry\u2019s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group\u2019s earnings growth potential.\n\nBefore we present you two top-ranked stocks from the industry, let's take a look at the industry\u2019s stock market performance and current valuation.\n\nIndustry Lags Sector and S&P 500\n\nThe Domestic Auto industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite and the sector over the past year. The industry has lost around 6% against the S&P 500\u2019s rally of 26.5%. The sector has risen 4.3% over the said time frame.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 19.08X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 14.4X and the sector\u2019s 13.83X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 61.04X, as low as 9.69X and at a median of 23.02X.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio\n\nBlue Bird: A prominent manufacturer of school buses and related parts, the company is a leader in alternative power. It offers alternative fuel applications and produces propane-powered and compressed natural gas-powered school buses. With a robust market demand and an order backlog of approximately 5,900 units valued at around $850 million, Blue Bird is experiencing notable growth. Initiatives like product enhancements for EVs, new safety features, complexity reduction, and quality improvements are contributing to its success. Manageable debt and sufficient liquidity add to its strengths.\n\nSignificant improvements in pricing, EV mix and parts sales resulted in record results for the first half of fiscal year 2024, prompting Blue Bird to raise its forecasts for the year. It expects fiscal 2024 revenues in the band of $1.27-$1.32 billion, up from $1.15-$1.25 billion guided earlier, as well as $1.13 billion recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA is now envisioned to be between $145 million and $165 million, higher than the prior projection of $120-$140 million and $88 million generated in fiscal 2023.\n\nBLBD currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Blue Bird\u2019s fiscal 2024 and 2025 EPS implies year-over-year growth of 140% and 2%, respectively. The consensus mark has moved north by 46 cents and 41 cents, respectively, over the past seven days. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on all occasions, the average surprise being 92.4%.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nGeneral Motors: One of the world\u2019s largest automakers, General Motors held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16.2% in 2023.Its compelling EV and ICE portfolio, with strong demand for its quality pickups and full-size SUVs, bodes well for delivery growth. The company\u2019s hot-selling brands in America\u2014 namely Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac\u2014 are boosting the top line.\n\nGeneral Motors is swiftly advancing in its electrification journey, bolstered by a remarkable 300% surge in battery module production over the last six months. General Motors\u2019 superior liquidity profile (total automotive liquidity of $33.3 billion as of Mar 31, 2024) and investor-friendly moves also instill confidence.\n\nDriven by GMNA's market strength, cost-reduction efforts and focus on improving EV business sales and profitability, the company has lifted 2024 forecasts. GM now expects adjusted EBIT in the range of $12.5-$14.5 billion, up from $12-$14 billion guided earlier. Adjusted EPS is anticipated in the range of $9-$10, up from $8.50-$9.50, guided earlier. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is expected in the band of $8.5-$10.5 billion, higher than the prior forecast of $8-$10 billion.\n\nGM currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors\u2019 2024 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 1.7% and 22.4%, respectively. The consensus mark for GM\u2019s 2024 and 2025 EPS has moved north by 32 cents and 29 cents, respectively, over the past 30 days. In the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on all occasions, the average surprise being 18%.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Investors should pay more attention to stocks that are trading for a discount. They offer outstanding buying opportunities, especially if the stock starts to gain momentum. Investors will have bought in at a low price.\n\nA large number of investors tend to follow the popular stocks and ones that have already seen incredible share price appreciation. And are inclined to avoid companies that aren\u2019t as exciting even though their long-term possibility of overall success may be much greater.\n\nWhen choosing stocks that are bargains and strong buys, I look for companies that trade at a reduced forward P/E compared to their sector and have strong earnings growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelestica (CLS) Person holding cellphone with website of Canadian electronics company Celestica Inc.

        "content": "Cruise, the self-driving robo taxi company owned by General Motors, reached a settlement with the pedestrian who was dragged by one of its vehicles last fall, according to someone with knowledge of the matter and independently verified by Fortune.\n\nThe settlement was between $8-12 million, Fortune has learned. It\u2019s unclear exactly when the settlement was reached.\n\nThe accident itself took place late in the evening on Oct. 2 when a pedestrian who was crossing the road in San Francisco was struck in a hit-and-run by another vehicle, then subsequently dragged for 20 feet by one of Cruise\u2019s autonomous robo-taxis. Regulators determined Cruise had not been forthcoming enough with them about the incident, and ordered Cruise to halt its taxi service in San Francisco. Cruise subsequently pulled all of its vehicles off the road across the U.S., and it is just now starting to reintroduce its robo taxi fleet back on the roads.\n\nThe current condition of the pedestrian remains unknown. A representative from Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, where the pedestrian was taken after the incident in critical condition, said that the pedestrian had been discharged, but declined to share any further information. The San Francisco Police Department said it continues to investigate the incident.\n\n\u201cThe hearts of all Cruise employees continue to be with the pedestrian, and we hope for her continued recovery,\" a Cruise spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nCruise said earlier this week that it would start testing its self-driving vehicles in Arizona\u2014operating autonomously, but with human drivers inside the vehicles to take over, if needed. The testing will begin in Phoenix and will then gradually move into other cities in the state. At the beginning of April, Cruise submitted responses to the California DMV to reinstate its permit, though the DMV told Fortune those responses are still under review.\n\nIn the six months following the October accident, General Motors slashed Cruise\u2019s annual budget by $1 billion and replaced nearly all of the company\u2019s management team. Cruise has recorded $9.2 billion in pre-tax losses since GM acquired the company in 2016, according to filings.\n\nDo you have an insight to share? Got a tip?

        "content": "If you are a bargain hunter like me, you will always be on the lookout for stocks to buy at a lower price and make the most of their upside.\n\nWhile all under-$10 stocks may not be worth your money,\u00a0a few stocks\u00a0have the potential to hit double digits. But, they may be trading below $10 due to several macroeconomic factors.\u00a0These stocks are solid buy-and-hold and could double your money if you have the patience. Once the economy improves and a rate cut materializes, you might not get an opportunity to buy these stocks below $10.\n\nIf you are\u00a0on the lookout\u00a0for stocks under $10 and want solid companies to invest in, here are my three picks. These are industry stalwarts with\u00a0strong\u00a0fundamentals, impressive annual earnings guidance and the potential to double your money. Let\u2019s dive into them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) SoFi logo sign on headquarters facade. Social Finance is an online personal finance company.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nFintech company SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI)\u00a0could become a multi-bagger in the next five years.\u00a0Trading at $7.49 today, the stock is down 26% year-to-date (YTD). In fact, it hasn\u2019t been able to touch double digits since the beginning of the year. Despite reporting impressive fundamentals in the last two quarters and raising the annual earnings guidance, the stock hasn\u2019t been able to pick up pace.\n\nIn the\u00a0recent earnings report, the net sales stood at $581 million, up 26% year-over-year (YOY), and the financial services segment saw a 33% jump.\u00a0It has seen a strong top line\u00a0despite the concerns about high interest rates.\u00a0The financial services segment reported net sales of $151 million. Also, the tech platform reported net sales of $91 million, up 21% YOY.\n\nSince SoFi Technologies relies on lending, this is a concern when it comes to the current macroeconomic environment. Investors are worried about defaults in the long term. However, the management is taking a conservative approach and has said that the lending segment revenue will drop 5% to 8% from the past year.\n\nAs revenue from the other segments\u00a0continue to grow, SOFI will see a solid improvement in the top and bottom lines. The company reported its first-ever profit in the fourth quarter and has been attracting new users at a steady rate. It ended the first quarter with 8.1 million users. For the past two quarters, it has seen a 44% jump in member growth.\n\nThus, SoFi\u00a0Technologies is set\u00a0to have a transitional year ahead\u00a0and\u00a0a rate cut could boost its business.\u00a0The long-term picture looks\u00a0highly attractive\u00a0and\u00a0this is one stock that\u00a0can double your money by 2025.\u00a0Buying SOFI stock under $10 is a smart move.\n\nStory continues\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmidst several reasons to bet on Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC),\u00a0you will need patience.\n\nExchanging hands for $4.50 today, the stock has lost 30%\u00a0value\u00a0since the beginning of the year. It is trading much lower than the 52-week high of $23.\u00a0But, expect strong upside potential once the Thacker Pass project commences. It is the largest lithium project in history,\u00a0and\u00a0the company aims to achieve\u00a0full\u00a0production by 2028.\n\nAs the electric vehicle (EV) industry recovers, the demand for lithium will be on the rise. So this becomes the key moment for Lithium Americas to strike. The construction of the project began last year. It has a mine life of 40 years and an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion. Besides Thacker Pass, Lithium Americas has received a $650 million investment from General Motors (NYSE:GM) for the Thacker Pass mine.\n\nAlso, the company has received a $2.26 billion loan from the\u00a0U.S. Department of Energy to help finance the construction of a Nevada processing plant.

        "content": "Participants\n\nCraig Shesky; Chief Financial Officer; TMC the metals company Inc\n\nGerard Barron; Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer; TMC the metals company Inc\n\nMalcolm MacDonald; Analyst; Bank of America\n\nFrank Jones; Analyst; Norbury Partners\n\nPresentation\n\nOperator\n\nGood day, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to The Metals Company first quarter 2024 corporate update conference. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\r\n I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Craig Shesky, CFO. Please go ahead.\n\nCraig Shesky\n\nThank you. And please note that during this call, certain statements made by the company will be forward-looking and based on management's beliefs and assumptions from information available at this time. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our control. Additionally, please note that the company's actual results may differ materially from what we go through in this call and that except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\r\n Our remarks today may also include non-GAAP financial measures, including with respect to free cash flows. The additional details regarding these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our slide deck being used with this call.\r\n And you're welcome to follow along with our slide deck or if joining us by phone, you can access it at any time at investors.metals.co.\r\n And I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Gerard Barron. Gerard, please go ahead.\n\nGerard Barron\n\nThank you, Craig, and thank you to all of you for attending our first quarter 2024 corporate update conference call. It's only been a month and a half since our last update. But even in that short time, we've seen some important project milestones and positive tailwinds for this industry.\r\n But I'd like to start with an exciting new addition to the TMC team. Last month, we were pleased to welcome Steve Jurvetson to our Board as Vice Chairman and strategic adviser. Steve is not just a legendary investor, but a visionary with wide and deep ranging curiosity. Among other roles, he is a current Board member of SpaceX, and former longtime Board member of Tesla.\r\n His investments represented $800 billion in aggregate value creation and include pioneering technology companies like Tesla and Planet Labs and SpaceX and Commonwealth Fusion Systems. And I'm proud to count him both as a supporter of our mission and an exciting TMC shareholder, and we are already benefiting from his contributions and collections.\r\n So I'll do a quick liquidity snapshot. Total liquidity stood at $49 million as at March 31, 2024. Since that time, TMC has drawn down $2.9 million out of our $45 million available capacity on unsecured credit facilities. And the use of these facilities provided by our three largest shareholders, including myself, should indicate how confident we are on the path forward and the news flow in the coming months, which we believe will be well received by current and potential investors.\r\n The next slide is a summary since our last quarterly update in late March. I'd like to draw your attention to the news we announced this morning. We have now uploaded the largest ever submission of environmental data to the International Seabed Authority. Drawn from 22 offshore campaigns to the NORI-D area, this wealth of new data adds a further 75,000 biological occurrences to the ISA's catalog of contracted data for the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, as well as a myriad of other data which will further enhance society's understanding of the deep sea ecosystem and the potential impacts of our operations.\r\n NORI's dataset is the largest of its kind ever gathered in the deep sea, and with much more data still to come, I am confident that our efforts over the past 12 years will provide the regulator with the data it needs to make informed decisions regarding our application. And as we move onto the agenda, you'll see we spend some time today focusing more specifically on the key questions that we'll be answering with our environmental impact assessment, the results of our investment over the past decade are now arriving almost daily, and we remain very encouraged by what we see.\r\n We are excited to share some of this with you today, along with some insight on why our team is increasingly confident that there are no showstoppers. We will progress -- also review the industry headlines, provide an update on regulatory progress, and end with -- (technical difficulty)\n\nStory continues\n\nCraig Shesky\n\nHey, sorry about that. this is CFO, Craig Shesky. I'm going to continue with our slides until we're able to get our CEO and Chairman, Gerard Barron dialed back in. But this page we're looking at now is focusing on really what we've already achieved. And certainly while our ride as a public company has sometimes been rocky, we're increasingly confident that we've now weathered that storm and are in a much firmer financial footing. Even amidst that volatility, it's pretty amazing to look back and see everything that our team has been able to do.\r\n So going back to the beginning of 2021, we laid out what we wanted to achieve as a public company. And then we got to work and started checking off those boxes. For example, in early 2021, we put out two SEC compliant resource statements and an initial assessment of the NORI-D area signed off by AMC consultants, noting a net present value at the time of $6.8 billion.\r\n In late 2021, we completed our pyrometallurgical processing pilot, de-risking a flow sheet in advance of future onshore operations. And in 2022, we completed the first successful integrated pilot system tests in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone since the 1970s, lifting 3,000 wet tonnes of nodules and helping to derisk our future operations alongside our partner, Allseas.\r\n And as we discussed last quarter, we also finished the last of our 22 preproduction offshore campaigns, including the completion in late February of our environmental campaign one year following our pilot collection test. So we've also successfully pivoted to a capital-light model with the support of key partners like PAMCO onshore and Allseas offshore, which can provide production assets to us for our exclusive use and then, of course, reduce preproduction CapEx requirements to a bare minimum.\r\n So our attention is now laser-focused on the main prerequisites for the milestone of launching our application for an exploitation contract of the minority area, particularly our pre-feasibility study and our environmental impact statement.\r\n So from first principles, why are we interested in deep-sea floor nodules in the first place? Well, for starters, the deeper sea plane represents an area of the planet with the least life per square meter as measured by biomass, but also relatively low biodiversity. These nodules contain high grades four metals in one ore, and sourcing battery metals from nodules requires no digging or blasting, and produces near zero solid waste and no tailings.\r\n And for offshore, we don't have to displace any human communities nor build a costly infrastructure necessary to access mineral resources on land. And this is why we can take a capital-light approach, which is almost unheard of for resource projects. There is also a remarkable correlation between the nodules and mineral composition and the composition of EV battery cathodes in wiring.\r\n Rich in nickel, copper, cobalt, and manganese, these nodules closely fit the requirements for the majority of the electric vehicle battery cathodes being sold today. And based on our continued conversations with major automakers, many new batteries are expected to continue to rely upon nickel-rich chemistries. And this is a very good time to remind you of our press release in early April, demonstrating we can turn nodules into nickel sulfate, indicative of battery market suitability, pending confirmation of those preliminary assays.\r\n And yes, even though EV outlooks have softened in recent months, the metallic composition nodules mean they're also remarkably suited for use in diverse other applications across the energy infrastructure and defense sectors. And this is where it's so advantageous to have a basket of metal products, each of which has exposure to sectors, which will be geopolitically critical in the coming decades. Whether it's the generation of nuclear power, the production of steel for use in infrastructure, wind turbines and the like, or in alloys for both commercial and defense sectors, nickel has numerous competing uses.\r\n Likewise, cobalt is garnering increasing interest for its use in production of hydrogen and use of hydrogen fuel cells as well as other defense applications. And of course, copper and manganese have underpinned nearly all global infrastructure in place today, and that will be built up in the future as we look to meet the needs of the industrialization of the developing world and multibillion global population growth.\r\n Already this quarter, copper prices have increased by 17%, driven in part by expectations of data center needs for powering AI. And prices for manganese this quarter, our second most important product, are up by nearly 30%.\r\n So as we've said many times before, our resource truly is an outlier among the world's nickel projects, and not only a non-oriental ranked by mining.com and the largest 200 nickel projects in the world, but the nickel equivalent grade of the resource is truly remarkable. And after a very rough 2023 in the nickel market due to low cost supply from the -- underneath the Indonesian rainforest, nickel prices have begun to stabilize and are now up 18% so far in the second quarter.\r\n With a nickel equivalent grade over 3% and four key metals in one resource, TMC is able to withstand commodity price volatility better than a typical project, and provide alternatives to the portion of the nickel market controlled and funded by China and Russia. And as noted on the previous slide, we are levered to metal market that each have a significant application in the defense sector amidst an increasingly tenuous global order.\r\n So at a time of heightened geopolitical competition, there's a lot of media coverage that's been devoted to the ongoing visit by President Xi of China to France. And one aspect to President Xi's visit which flew under the radar was the acquired publication of a joint China-France declaration in which both parties committed themselves to remaining engaged in the development of regulations at the ISA and support for ongoing environmental impact assessments to support evidence-based decision-making.\r\n France has flip-flopped on its support for this industry in the past, and the softened language on display in this joint statement reflects an interesting development in its stance, perhaps suggesting that the French government is now taking seriously its obligations that are on class and that China's favorable view of this industry is rubbing off on France rather than the other way around.\r\n Gerard, I see that you're back. If you'd like to (multiple speakers) -- we're on page 14.\n\nGerard Barron\n\nTechnical issues have been resolved. My apologies for that. So taking the mantle back up, so there's been a steady pace of news out of China on seafloor mining over the past few years, culminating in the Washington Post piece in October regarding Chinese keen interest in deep sea floor resources. While also acknowledging TMC's leadership role in this industry, Chinese urgency in this space has accelerated in the last several weeks with not one but two contractors submitting environmental impact statements to conduct nodule collection tests in 2025. There is still much work ahead for the Chinese contractors, and we do not expect commercial production from them before the early 2030s.\r\n But certainly, these actions from China regarding deep sea floor resources are sounding alarm bells in Washington DC. As reported in the Wall Street Journal in March, a bill aimed at providing support for domestic nodule collection processing and refining has been introduced by members of the House of Representatives, titled the Responsible Use of Seafloor Resources Act. Also in March, over 350 former political and military leaders, including Hillary Clinton urged the US Senate to ratify the Law of the Sea Treaty.\r\n Of course, I'm sure many of you are interested in the timing of the delivery of a report by the Pentagon to the House Armed Services Committee, assessing the opportunities offered by nodules to diversify critical mineral supply chains away from China. And we are quite interested in the date of this report as well. The Pentagon is continuing its detailed analysis, and while we do not have certainty on the date of the report's completion, the tone and tenor of the work seems to be very encouraging.\r\n And further, we're in active dialogue with members of Congress regarding the prioritization of feasibility work for the future refining of nodule-derived products in the United States, building on the existing base of support demonstrated in last year's National Defense Authorization Act. So we look forward to sharing more developments on this front in the coming weeks and months.\r\n Despite activist efforts to sway OEMs, we were encouraged this month to see two of the world's largest car companies and EV heavyweights, Tesla and General Motors, stand up for evidenced-based decision making and recommend the rejection of proposals to support a moratorium. And we hold firmly to the belief that all projects, whether on land or on the deep sea floor, must be judged by merits, and we remain confident in the clear advantages offered by the nodule resource.\r\n And of course, as benchmark found in the recent LCA of NORI-D project, nodules would outperform key land-based production routes for nickel, cobalt, representing 90% of global supply and copper, 20% of global supply in almost every impact category analyzed. But again, this will not be a one-size-fit-all situation. The needs of the energy transition will require a mosaic approach where all options remain on the table to be judged on their merits, based on science rather than activism.\r\n I'd now like to play a short video on that environmental work and then turn the call over to Craig to take you through some detail on the NORI-D project.\n\n(video starts)\r\n Developing the NORI-D nodule project without causing serious harm to the marine environment is a core objective for The Metals Company and a prerequisite for the International Seabed Authority to permit commercial production. This is why the Environmental Impact Statement or EIS is the largest and arguably most important component of the NORI-D exploitation application to the ISA. Our environmental impact statement is the outcome of a decade-long exploration work program that started with our first offshore campaign in 2012. Since then, we have executed a total of 22 environmental campaign, spending 507 days on site in the NORI-D area.\r\n This work program was executed in collaboration with researchers from the world's leading marine institutions and expert industry contractors. Over 100 studies have been conducted in total. First, to characterize the marine environment on the NORI-D area, also known as environmental baseline, and then to monitor how this environment was impacted by our pilot technology to collect nodules from the seafloor and lift them to the surface.\r\n This scope and depth of research for an environmental impact assessment for a natural resource project is unprecedented. On-land EIAs for resource projects typically focus on the largest and most vulnerable species that exist above ground with little consideration for smaller organisms like microbes and biodiversity belowground.\r\n In the ocean, we investigate biological communities that exist throughout the water column from the largest mammals and fish in the uppermost sunlight zone to the microscopic organisms that live in the sediment and make up the majority of living biomass at the abyssal seafloor.\r\n How do we make sense of the hundreds of terabytes of environmental data collected in the NORI-D area? Based on a public consultation with deep-sea researchers, NORI structured the assessment around five key potential impacts, each investigated by a team of specialist researchers: One, plumes; two noise; three eco-toxicity; four, biodiversity; and five, CO2.\r\n Each part of the assessment required thousands of hours of high-tech equipment deployment, data capture, and intensive analysis. All underlying environmental data are shared with public databases like the ISA's deep data and UNESCO's OBIS database on marine biodiversity. Once completed and submitted as part of our exploitation application for the NORI-D nodule project, the EIS will provide the International Seabed Authority with a science-based assessment of the impact of our proposed operations enabling the regulator to make informed decisions.\r\n (video ends)\n\nCraig Shesky\n\nAnd that video is available in our slide deck posted on our website for anybody that may have had video freezing issues. Apologies for that. But certainly the accumulation of baseline data over the last decade-plus does represent the most comprehensive deep-sea dataset ever collected in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. And it was collected in partnership with many of the world's leading marine research institutions and expert industry contractors. And this dataset is generating a lot of excitement among the researchers who have truly acknowledge the rigor and the scale of this science program.\r\n This deep data is openly shared to public databases including the ISA's deep data library of contractor data as well as other open source databases like UNESCO's ocean biodiversity information system or OBIS, the world's largest catalog of marine organisms.\r\n Our environmental impact assessment has a very specific focus to assess the potential impacts of our operations on marine biodiversity and ecosystem functions. To this end, our team identified six primary concerns related to our operations for further investigation based on discussions with stakeholders. And thanks to these efforts, a far more in-depth understanding of our expected impacts is emerging and that contradicts much of the speculation by activists and some of the media.\r\n Off the back of our 2022 test pilot collection, we've now seen the infield observed data showing that 92% to 98% of sediment mobilized at the seafloor stays within two meters of the seafloor and settles locally. This finding is critically important as it addresses speculation that sediment plumes could travel tens of thousands of kilometers or could rise up four kilometers to the surface and impact climate change.\r\n As noted on last quarter's call, when we did a deep dive within the sea floor, including data, this is a clear example of why the speculation of opposition groups was very wrong and in-field observed data needs to take precedence over such speculation.\r\n We've also made significant strides in assessing the impacts of noise from our test mining and last week received a comprehensive report from HR Wallingford, which outlined how the underwater noise model they have been developing predicts that impairment to the hearing of marine mammals does not occur beyond the distance of 20 meters from the nodule collection activity under the assumption that the animals can swim away.\r\n Even without that assumption, the temporary threshold shift as predicted between 20 and 1,100 meters from the mining and permanent threshold shift between 10 and 65 meters. And given that whales don't dive within thousands of meters of our planned nodule collection, we view this as very good news and are very confident that noise concerns will not be a significant impediment.\r\n And while some claim that nodule collection would irreversibly destroys abyssal habitats, the reality is that such operations would result in the transformation of patches of seafloor from one habitat type that is ubiquitous in the deep-sea to another. Even assuming that all current exploration contracts proceeded to production, only 0.18% of the global seafloor would be transformed in this way. And as our recent offshore campaigns to assess ecosystem recovery showed, life has begun returning to those areas most directly impacted by sentiment plumes within a year.\r\n And several of those primary concerns I just went through are interrelated. For example, if the seafloor food is limited, as we know it is, it also limits the potential impact on seafloor biodiversity and the relatively low amount of carbon stored in seafloor sediment. As noted above, we now know that 92% to 98% of sediment mobilized at the seafloor rises no more than a couple of meters and settles within hours or days. And as a result, there is no known pathway for this negligible amount of carbon to make its way 4 kilometers up to the surface and reach the atmosphere.\r\n And our oceans do indeed store significant amounts of carbon, but less than 5% of this carbon is contained in seafloor sediments. And despite covering almost 90% of the global ocean area. Abyssal planes account for a fraction of the total carbon locked away in seafloor sediments, none of which appears to be available for microbial conversion to CO2.\r\n As the true environmental impacts of nodule collection become clear, thanks to the wealth of emerging data, activists may continue to spread misinformation, but it's going to be the actual in-field observed data that matters to the adults in the room who will be making these key permitting decisions, which brings us to the regulatory update.\r\n We were very encouraged by the progress at the most recent ISA meeting in Jamaica, in line with the positive commentary on this industry's inevitability from Secretary General Michael Lodge to CNBC earlier this year. The current President of the ISA council, Mr. Olav Myklebust of Norway spoke to the substantive advancements made during the March session in his closing remarks, quote, I'm very pleased with the progress made by the Council. We are moving forward with the development of regulations on the exploitation of deep seabed minerals with strong environmental protection at a good pace, unquote.\r\n And as noted in our last call, the consolidated regulatory text was released in late February, signaling the transition to the final phase of mining code negotiations. And we, at TMC, continue to intend to launch our application for an exploitation contract over the NORI-D area at some point following this year's July ISA meeting. One of the key decisions on our application is the recommendation from the Legal and Technical Commission or LTC. And the individuals of the LTC reviewed the application, they were all subject matter experts.\r\n If consensus on an approval recommendations that reached, the decision is made by simple majority vote. And if the LTC recommends approval, the Council reviews and if acceptable, approves the recommendation. Two-thirds majority of the ISA council would be needed to overturn a positive LTC recommendation. And certainly, we expect plenty of back-and-forth and questions from the LTC, both before and following our application. But we feel very good about our ability to have the application stand on its merits during what will be a very well thought out and thorough review process.\r\n So onto the project economics. In March 2021, AMC consultants issued SEC Reg S- K 1300 compliant initial assessment of the project economics for the NORI-D area. The initial assessments available in the Investors section of our website as are the resource statements for both NORI and TOML. Initial assessment arrived at the net present value of $6.8 billion for NORI-D at the beginning of last -- excuse me, at the beginning of 2021.\r\n Running the same model solely updated for current metal prices, the net present value of NORI-D would be approximately $11.5 billion and our current market cap would represent just about 4% of that number, despite the very significant milestones already achieved on a project that's less than two years away from expected commercial production and still a huge discount to pure nickel or copper developers at this stage of preproduction.\r\n Now going through the financial results. In the first quarter of 2024, TMC reported a net loss of $25.2 million or $0.08 per share compared to TMC's net loss of $13.7 million, or $0.05 per share for the same period in 2023. The net loss for the first quarter of 2024 including exploration and evaluation expenses of $18.1 million versus $7.2 million in Q1 2023. General and administrative expenses of $6.6 million and versus $6.2 million in Q1 2023.\r\n Exploration and evaluation expenses increased by $10.9 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This significant increase is primarily due to an increase in mining, technological, and process development of $10.5 million, specifically tied to the increased geotechnical work, which was the majority of the costs incurred this quarter for offshore Campaign 8B, which concluded in February. Plus some additional expenses incurred on the transportation of nodules to PAMCO's facility in Japan, and some higher personnel costs.\r\n This is partially offset by a decrease in environmental study costs as the cost for campaigning, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2023 was completed in the first quarter this year. General and administrative expenses increased slightly by $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023. The increase is due to higher amortization of share-based comp and higher consulting fees offset by lower legal costs.\r\n In the first quarter of 2024, the net cash used in operating activities amounted to $11.9 million compared to $23.5 million for the first quarter of 2023. The large gap between the net loss for Q1 2024 and the net cash used in operating activities for the same period is due to share-based compensation and expense settled with equity and some changes in working capital.\r\n The free cash flow for the first quarter of 2024 was negative $12.1 million compared to negative $23.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure, and I'd point you to the non-GAAP reconciliation table included in the slide deck and on our website.\r\n Regarding the balance sheet, as at March 31, 2024, we closed the quarter with $4.0 million in cash. And as we noted, we have sufficient liquidity on hand to continue to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from today.\r\n So I'm now going to turn it back over to our Chairman and CEO, Gerard Barron for some closing remarks. And then from that point, we will take some questions both on the phone line as well as the webcast. Gerard, back over to you.\n\nGerard Barron\n\nYeah, thank you, Craig. As I said at our earnings press release, 2024 is the year when we expect most of the activist driven speculation about the environmental impacts of our emerging industry will be displaced by data and evidence. We're encouraged that an increasing number of countries and automakers are showing the courage to keep this transformational resource on the table.\r\n And in the meantime, our executive team will continue the work of securing strategic partnerships while keeping our eye firmly focused on the date of first production, which marches ever closer.\r\n I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to my TMC team, including our partners and contractors and of course, to our sponsoring states. And thanks to everyone who tuned in for your interest and attention.\r\n And with that, we'd like to turn it back to the operator for some Q&A.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions)\n\nCraig Shesky\n\nAs those questions are being compiled, we can take a question from Eric Goldstein on the webcast. I'll put this to you first, Gerard, and then I can weigh in as well.\r\n How do we expect the ISA meetings to go this year? Specifically, what do we expect in the July meeting, and the [$40,000] question, when are all the rules and regs going to be passed?\n\nGerard Barron\n\nSure. Look, we are expecting solid progress. When the ISA meets again, of course, it will be the legal and technical commission, the Council and the Assembly meeting. And so what we are looking for is progress. And of course, we had the legal right to lodge our application. We notified the market that we would not lodge an application until after the July session this year, and before the end of 2024.\r\n And so we know that there is an enormous amount of work happening intercessionally. And I think what we are encouraged by is that the regulations now that there is a consolidated text that was debated back in the March session, is drawing to a -- what we think is a robust final version.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Malcolm MacDonald, BofA.\n\nMalcolm MacDonald\n\nHey guys. You know who is pushing this moratorium to Tesla and GM is an NGO. That's number one. Number two, if you could comment on Biden's Chinese EV tariffs today and Trump's subsequent comments and with regards how that affects the Inflation Reduction Act; specifically how it reflects to Tesla and GM? And then lastly what is the timeline for the Chinese entities that are -- as you mentioned earlier in the call, that are expected to conduct tests next year versus your timeline and if the United States wanted to get in the game independently, how late are they?\n\nCraig Shesky\n\nYeah. Look, so specifically starting with the shareholder proposals for GM and Tesla, the one for Tesla is specifically, they're called As You Sow. But look, for both GM and Tesla, we don't want to get into who's behind each of them, but yeah, it's NGO-driven. We also view it as very anti-science to effectively say, as all of this new data has been coming through, as Gerard said, almost on a daily basis. Some people are now recognizing that it's not confirming their previously held belief, almost the definition of confirmation bias.\r\n So because of that, you're now seeing a push for something like this to be taken off the table at a time when many other automakers are being forced to invest elsewhere in rainforest nickel, which puts them in difficult position. So we think the science will continue to speak for itself. And frankly, we're very heartened by the fact that the Boards of both Tesla and GM recommended voting no against such proposals that we take clearly viable options off the table.\n\nGerard Barron\n\nAnd on the China front, we -- of course, they are planning to launch an application to be able to do a collective trial next year. And so that will take a year for the regulator to opine on that. And if I reflect on our own application, it was a big heavy lift. It's required a lot of work. And that means they need to receive the approval to go and do that and then they need to go and do it. And so I think what the Chinese contractors have said quite openly is that they expect to be in production on the other side of this decade.\r\n And so there's a lot of work. We were very fortunate to have a collective trial that ran so successfully in 2022, involved our first production vessel, the hidden gem. And as you know, we're getting that vessel ready for first production and we remain on track for that in 2026. So there is no doubt that we hold a competitive edge over all of the other contractors, including China. And that's a great opportunity for Western economies like the United States.\r\n Now, tariffs to protect the automakers? Look, I don't really want to comment on that too much other than the Inflation Reduction Act was really intended to bring jobs in industry and secure supply lines and raw materials for American industry. And I think that and there have been some uses of those funds, which potentially have simply, I guess, driven demand for electric vehicles, but have they really driven jobs in the United States?\r\n And so what I think is there's a great opportunity and whether it's either of the names you mentioned as the future president of the United States. I think there will be more focus on how do you build jobs and how do you help those economies build independence and you can't do that without raw materials, without battery materials.\r\n And so we're encouraged, as I said earlier, in the messaging that we're hearing out of DC. We continue to talk to relevant parties there. We continue to answer questions as they are asked. And based on the conversations that we're lucky enough to be part of, we're encouraged. And so the Inflation Reduction Act will hopefully be a very good thing. Some materials that are derived from polymetallic nodules, particularly those that TMC have their hands on.\n\nCraig Shesky\n\nYeah. I might also comment on that Malcolm, that we noted upfront really on slide 11, which I will pull up now as folks are able to see it -- you really can't get away from the fact that nodules are composed in such a manner that lines up not just with EVs, which is the focus of that question, but also so many other applications that are experiencing demand tailwinds, which you can't really change, of course, is some of the supply realities.\r\n And even taking nickel, for example, nickel grades have declined over time. Copper grades have declined over time. It becomes more and more difficult to find new high-quality high-grade deposits of some of these metals on land. The change of that occurs, sometimes when you have a large new source like what you saw from Indonesian nickel supply over the last decade.\r\n But even Indonesia announced that at this point, let's say, next decade, we're going to be running quite low on some of the higher grade reserves and there are going to be opportunities for nodules, given how much we've seen smelter capacity get built out. So the reality is certainly on the demand side, would be inflation reduction and acting on tariffs on EVs, perhaps some comments from Trump noting the things that he would do with the Inflation Reduction Act.\r\n That's all quite marginal when it comes to the global demand for these metals and having this basket of very attractive commodities allows us to withstand fluctuations in a way that many land-based operators just aren't able to do.\n\nMalcolm MacDonald\n\nThanks. So basically, to just square the circle here, the US is behind, China is trying to get ahead, but you guys are in first place. And in order for the US to compete with China, they're going to have to partner with someone like yourself.\n\nGerard Barron\n\nWill that is their opportunity? That's for sure.\n\nMalcolm MacDonald\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Frank Jones, Norbury Partners\n\nFrank Jones\n\nHey, guys. Great update as usual. Two questions for me. First one, pretty quick, I think I know the answer, but just confirming. On a liquidity front, you mentioned we're good for 12 months meeting capital needs and just want to make sure that's inclusive of application demands. And I guess in that, I should read that major exploration and evaluation expenses are behind us?\r\n And then the second one I ask this every time, but I know by the next time we have one of these calls, the pre-feasibility work will probably be out so any guidance on timing for that? And with that, the final agreements with PAMCO and Allseas and what those splits look like?\n\nCraig Shesky\n\nYeah, sure. Starting with those questions, I mean, let's start with the last one on the pre-feasibility side. Yeah, we're pushing very hard on that. We're very encouraged. Our teams have been in Japan and the Netherlands, respectively, in the last month. So there's a lot of on-the-groundwork and cooperation which just shows how committed not only our team is, but the teams of our partners. So yes, we are not changing any update on timing or guidance on that front.\r\n You did note in terms of us having the liquidity necessary to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months, that's an analysis done on committed costs. But what I would draw you to is the typical guidance that we provide, which we're happy to reiterate that what we need to launch the application at some point following the July 2024 session of the ISA is an incremental $35 million to $45 million. You can then reduce that dollar for dollar for what we drew upon our credit facility, $2.9 million.\r\n So that range that we came out with really two quarters ago -- actually more than two quarters ago, we'd continue to reiterate because the spending necessary to launch that application has been under tight controls by our team. So what I would say is keep that range in mind, and it's a range that is less than the total liquidity options that we have available to us, even though that may not be our ultimate choice on how we fund that next stage getting into production.\n\nFrank Jones\n\nGot it. Super helpful. Thank you, both.\n\nCraig Shesky\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'm currently showing no further questions over the phone line at this time. I'd now like to turn it back to Craig Shesky.\n\nCraig Shesky\n\nWe got a couple more actually, and I'm happy to take a few on the webcast. There is a question from Rich Wesolowski: does the company need the US Senate to ratify the UN Convention to succeed? The answer there is no. It's really to us a sign of the increased commitment from the US to the space, but also the recognition that the US truly should have a seat at the table in how this very important industry is going to be regulated.\r\n And what we laid out in today's update was the actions of a lot of countries we showed on the slide in addition to the France-China joint statement, the new deep-sea mining legislation from Belgium, that builds upon the deep sea exploration news coming out of Norway earlier this year and then pending environmental work, potentially deep sea exploitation in Norwegian territorial waters.\r\n There are just a lot of very large populous, credible industrial countries, and that includes India, and China, Japan and now the United States that are very interested in this industry. And frankly, if the US chose not to ratify the UN Convention and not take their full seat at the table at the ISA, it just continues to underscore that the only real way they can get access to this resource would be through a contractor like TMC.\r\n And I think we have time for one more question. There is a question coming in from an anonymous investor: can we talk, Gerard, about where you're spending your time in terms of strategic partnerships? Any updates on those efforts on the strategic fronts and where our time is going to be spent in the coming months?\n\nGerard Barron\n\nWell, I could share my diary, of course. That would be quite revealing. Look in the last six months in particular, we've spent a lot of time in Asia and mainly in Indonesia. And we're fascinated with Indonesia, of course, because it's where all of the growth in nickel material is coming from. Unfortunately, it's coming from nickel laterites, but they have built a very strong processing industry to be able to process those materials. And as we know, you can process our polymetallic nodules with that same infrastructure answer.\r\n And so it's a very interesting opportunity for us. And there are some very strong cooperations there who are heavily involved in nickel. The Indonesian Government are trying to build out a battery materials supply chain even more extensively than they have now, by building battery refining. We saw companies like BYD announcing that they're actually going to build cars there.\r\n And so there's no doubt things are moving in that country. But Asia is certainly a very friendly place for TMC right now. And we see tremendous opportunity, of course, by sending our nodules to places like Indonesia. We do believe that we can slow down the expansion of some of that nickel laterite resource development and replace rainforest nickel with nodules. And that's going to be a good thing for the planet. And it seems that that message is being well received in that country.\r\n And of course, by being able to utilize that existing infrastructure means that we can toll our modules through some of those processing plants, which means that we don't have to go and spend money to build processing.\r\n My team and I were recently up in Japan. We've just had 2,000 tonnes of nodules arrive with our partner, PAMCO. And that's a company that's been processing nickel ores since the 1960s. They're an amazingly competent partner for us and perfect to get us started. So there are many opportunities around that region getting things done in Europe is harder, of course, and we do remain hopeful that in North America, our efforts in DC will be recognized. I don't think we'll ever build a pyrometallurgical plant in the USA. But I do believe that we can send our intermediate product into the USA for further refining into battery materials. And so we are continuing to make efforts in that area.\n\nCraig Shesky\n\nYeah, and that makes sense, too. And just adding a little color to you on the pyrometallurgical side. That focus on the refining of intermediate products potentially in the United States is firmly in line with the DC strategy we've been deploying this year. And as a lot of focus is on National Defense Authorization Act coming out this year, there continues to be a lot of support for feasibility work on something like that. And frankly, it makes perfect sense so that the US avoids falling further behind.\r\n So that's all the time that we have today. But we appreciate all of you taking the time to join us, and we're certainly looking forward to sharing more progress on the next quarterly call. And for those of you who are already shareholders, we're looking forward to speaking to you at our Annual General Meeting.\r\n So thank you very much. And I turn it back over to the operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Biden's tariffs on Chinese EVs will have little immediate impact on the US auto market",
        "content": "The big headline from President Biden\u2019s new tariffs on Chinese goods announced Tuesday was the massive hit to electric vehicles made in China.\n\nNew duties on EVs from companies like BYD, Geely, and NIO are set to quadruple in 2024, to 100% from 25% of the cost of the vehicle.\n\nBut the question remains \u2014 will Biden\u2019s EV tariff move make any difference for EV sales in America?\n\nThe White House\u2019s sweeping array of new tariffs will raise duties on $18 billion in Chinese imports like steel to semiconductors to medical products. But it is the focus on EVs and manufacturing that stands out.\n\nThe White House earmarked billions via the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to boost EV adoption, charging, and create an American manufacturing industrial complex to support EV production. Visitors are looking at a BYD DM-i electric car at the 2024 Beijing International Automotive Exhibition in Beijing, China, on May 3, 2024. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nBiden\u2019s move to protect his EV bet is not surprising. And the overall effect on the American consumer will, initially, be slim to none, as there are very few Chinese made EVs for sale in America.\n\nCurrently, only Buick, Lincoln, Lotus, Polestar, and Volvo ship vehicles made in China into the US, Sam Fiorani of AutoForecast Solutions noted to Yahoo Finance.\n\nOf those cars, only Polestar imports a Chinese-made EV to the US. Lotus just started shipping its luxury EV in extremely limited quantities. According to KBB, 1.2 million EVs were sold in America in 2023. Polestar did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPolestar does not break out its overall global sales by territory, but the company delivered 54,600 cars across territories like the China, the EU, and the US last year. Even if a generous half of those vehicles are counted as US sales, the percent of Chinese-made EVs sold in America makes up just over 2% of all EV sales.\n\n\u201cThe duty is unlikely to significantly impact the US auto market as relatively few Chinese EVs are being imported, and this new level will only further discourage buyers from turning to Chinese EVs,\u201d Beacon Policy Advisors said in a note to clients.\n\n\u201cThe value for Biden, though, is the attention that nearly quadrupling the tariff grabs and provides the president a clear campaign talking point.\u201d US President Joe Biden talks to the media after driving the new electric Ford F-150 Lightning at the Ford Dearborn Development Center in Dearborn, Michigan on May 18, 2021. (Photo by Nicholas Kamm / AFP) (Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images) (NICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images)\n\nAnd the auto industry\u2019s main lobbying arm is, not surprisingly, backing the move.\n\n\"[China's] got a major EV overcapacity problem. They\u2019re building too many EVs \u2014 too many heavily subsidized EVs \u2014 for the domestic market and have no choice but to look abroad to offload those vehicles at budget prices. It\u2019s happening already in Europe,\" said John Bozzella, president and CEO of Alliance for Automotive Innovation (AAI) in a statement Tuesday morning.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It\u2019s appropriate for the White House to be looking at tools to prevent the US from becoming a dumping ground for subsidized Chinese EVs.\u201d\n\nThe United Auto Workers (UAW), which endorsed Biden\u2019s reelection campaign earlier this year, also applauded the president\u2019s \"decisive\" action, calling it \"a major step in the right direction.\"\n\nOhio Senator Sherrod Brown is even pushing Biden to go further, posting last week that tariffs aren't enough and \"we need to ban Chinese EVs from the US.\" A Polestar electric vehicle is at the New York International Auto Show in New York on Saturday, March 30, 2024. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nNonetheless, quadrupling import tariffs to 100% could severely dampen even those minimal sales. And the new duties may ultimately hurt the American consumer in ways beyond sales at a dealership.\n\n\"Chinese EVs and batteries, along with solar products, will be excluded from the US market,\" free trade expert Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Yahoo Finance. \"The result will be higher US prices, and slower uptake of climate-friendly technology. This is a regrettable price of the US-China Cold War, and US presidential political dynamics.\"\n\nAutoForecast Solutions\u2019 Fiorani also believes these new tariffs will slow the advance of Chinese made EVs in America, but there could be a backdoor.\n\n\u201cCongress is looking to control the importation of vehicles by Chinese brands, but that will be difficult when they\u2019re not made in China,\u201d Fiorani said.\n\n\u201cEstablishing production facilities outside of China, especially in Mexico or South Korea, will be one of the possible methods of getting around basic legislation.\u201d\n\nLater this week, for instance, BYD will debut a new plug-in hybrid EV pickup that will be assembled in Mexico A prototype version of BYD's plug-in hybrid pickup, the Shark (credit: BYD) (BYD)\n\nAdvocates for tariffs believe protection from Chinese EV imports are necessary, otherwise American automakers will be overwhelmed by the competition, and a backdoor through Mexico could be the trigger.\n\nHufbauer also believes, however, the tariffs are too extreme and likely overkill.\n\n\u201cThe US auto industry could certainly survive and even prosper if, say, Chinese EVs and batteries were limited to 15% of the market, rather than excluded,\u201d Hufbauer said.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Shift Into High Gear With These 2 Domestic Auto Stocks",
        "content": "The near-term prospects of the Zacks Domestic Auto\u00a0industry will be shaped by various factors. Vehicle sales are expected to grow this year, albeit at a slower rate compared to 2023 amid inflationary pressure, high borrowing costs and economic uncertainty. While increased labor expenses stemming from the recent UAW agreement will play a deterrent, the effects of it would be largely offset by declining input costs. Normalization of supply chains has boosted inventory levels but margins are under pressure due to heightened consumer discounts.\r\n\r\nAlthough electric vehicle (EV) sales are expected to increase this year, it will require more effort from companies to drive sales due to a slower-than-expected pace of adoption, underscoring the need for the industry to navigate evolving consumer preferences and market dynamics. Two industry participants \u2014 General Motors GM and Blue Bird Corporation BLBD \u2014 are well-positioned to drive gains to your portfolio.\n\nIndustry Overview\n\nThe Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry \u2014 which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people \u2014 is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through. The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in a fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development, and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.\n\nKey Factors at Play\n\nVehicle Sales Growth to Decelerate: New vehicle sales in the United States rose 5.1% in the first quarter of 2024 backed by strong inventory, incentives and healthy fleet volumes. The seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first quarter came in at 15.4 million, implying a year-over-year uptick of 2.7%. While vehicle sales are projected to grow in 2024, inflationary pressure, high costs of borrowing and an uncertain macro environment are expected to influence purchase decisions and slow down the pace of growth rate relative to 2023.\n\nManufacturing Costs Dynamics: The UAW agreement reached in 2023 is set to raise labor costs for all automakers as the firms aim to stay competitive in attracting and retaining talent. General Motors and Ford anticipate a roughly $9 billion increase in costs over the four-year agreement period. However, excluding labor, most input costs for automakers have declined since the pandemic peak, including steel, rubber, plastics, and glass. Just that the double-digit wage hikes in the UAW contract will weigh on total costs in 2024, offsetting some of the savings from input costs deflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmple Inventory Aiding Sales but Ailing Margins: Post-pandemic supply chain disruptions have significantly eased, leading to a notable recovery in new vehicle inventory. According to estimates from J.D. Power and GlobalData, inventory levels reached approximately 1.7 million vehicles in March, marking a 4.2% increase from February and a 39% surge from March 2023. This surplus inventory has prompted increased incentives and discounts for consumers, thereby addressing affordability concerns. However, these discounts are impacting the average selling price of vehicles, thereby squeezing the profit margins of firms.\n\nE-Mobility Landscape: EV sales growth in the United States is decelerating due to a slower-than-anticipated pace of customer acceptance. In the first quarter of 2024, Americans purchased 268,909 new EVs, constituting 7.3% of total new vehicle sales, a decline from the fourth quarter of 2023. Nonetheless, Cox Automotive projects a year-over-year increase in EV sales for 2024, aiming for roughly 10% market share by year-end. To achieve this, the EV market anticipates an influx of new models, incentives, discounts, and advertising. However, dealers will need to exert more effort to bolster sales in the face of evolving consumer preferences.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Holds Promise\n\nThe Zacks Automotive \u2013 Domestic industry is part of the broader Zacks\u00a0Auto-Tires-Trucks\u00a0sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #80, which places it in the top 32% of 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group\u2019s\u00a0Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry\u2019s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group\u2019s earnings growth potential.\n\nBefore we present you two top-ranked stocks from the industry, let's take a look at the industry\u2019s stock market performance and current valuation.\n\nIndustry Lags Sector and S&P 500\n\nThe Domestic Auto industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite and the sector over the past year. The industry has lost around 6% against the S&P 500\u2019s rally of 26.5%. The sector has risen 4.3% over the said time frame.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 19.08X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 14.4X and the sector\u2019s 13.83X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 61.04X, as low as 9.69X and at a median of 23.02X, as the chart below shows.\n\nEV/EBITDA Ratio (Past Five Years)\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio\n\nBlue Bird: A prominent manufacturer of school buses and related parts, the company is a leader in alternative power. It offers alternative fuel applications and produces propane-powered and compressed natural gas-powered school buses. With a robust market demand and an order backlog of approximately 5,900 units valued at around $850 million, Blue Bird is experiencing notable growth. Initiatives like product enhancements for EVs, new safety features, complexity reduction, and quality improvements are contributing to its success. Manageable debt and sufficient liquidity add to its strengths.\n\nSignificant improvements in pricing, EV mix and parts sales resulted in record results for the first half of fiscal year 2024, prompting Blue Bird to raise its forecasts for the year. It expects fiscal 2024 revenues in the band of $1.27-$1.32 billion, up from $1.15-$1.25 billion guided earlier, as well as $1.13 billion recorded in fiscal 2023.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights General Motors, BorgWarner and Oshkosh",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 May 14, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: General Motors GM, BorgWarner BWA and Oshkosh Corp. OSK.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTime to Buy These 3 Auto Stocks on Raised Outlooks\n\nAs the first-quarter 2024 earnings season for the auto sector draws to a close, a mixed picture is emerging. Per the Earnings Trends report dated May 8, the beat ratio for the bottom line was 62.5%, while the same for the top line was 50%. While overall earnings of the sector have declined 19% year over year amid macroeconomic uncertainty due to inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions, there is still some optimism left.\n\nA few prominent players in the industry \u2014 General Motors, BorgWarner and Oshkosh Corp. \u2014 have defied the pessimism and uncertainty by upwardly revising their guidance.\n\nThe raised guidance not only shows the companies\u2019 confidence in their prospects but also attracts investors looking for promising opportunities. However, are these upward forecasts enough to consider investing in these auto stocks? Let\u2019s delve deeper.\n\nGeneral Motors: The U.S. auto giant reported first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.62 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.08 and increased 18.5% year over year. Revenues of $43.01 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.28 billion and increased from $39.9 billion recorded in the year-ago period.\n\nOn the back of encouraging first-quarter performance, GMNA market strength, cost-reduction efforts, and focus on improving EV business sales and profitability, the company has lifted 2024 forecasts. GM now expects adjusted EBIT in the range of $12.5-$14.5 billion, up from $12-$14 billion guided earlier. Adjusted EPS is anticipated in the range of $9-$10, up from $8.50-$9.50, guided earlier. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is expected in the band of $8.5-$10.5 billion, higher than the prior forecast of $8-$10 billion.\n\nGeneral Motors\u2019 superior liquidity profile (total automotive liquidity of $33.3 billion as of Mar 31, 2024) and investor-friendly moves also instill confidence. In the last reported quarter, GM bought back around 13 million shares, including 4 million from the accelerated share repurchase program. The company\u2019s first-quarter dividend also marked a 33% hike.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile stiff competition (especially in the China market) and high R&D costs and capex requirements are somewhat concerning, we think that the positives are set to outweigh the near-term hiccups. You can consider parking your money in the stock. Also, the legacy automaker is attractively valued. It is trading at a forward sales multiple of 0.29, below its median of 0.35 over the last five years.\n\nAnalysts have upwardly revised GM\u2019s earnings outlook for the current fiscal. Over the past seven days, EPS estimates for 2024 have moved up by 2 cents to $9.40, implying 22.4% growth year over year. General Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a Value Score of A.\n\nOshkosh: This automotive equipment provider reported first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.89 per share, beating the consensus mark of $2.26 and rising from $1.59 per share recorded in the year-ago period. Consolidated net sales climbed 12.2% year over year to $2.54 billion. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.51 billion.\n\nEncouraged by strong first-quarter results, healthy demand for products, solid business execution across segments, launch of innovative offerings, capacity expansions and acquisition synergies, OSK raised its 2024 guidance. Oshkosh now expects consolidated 2024 sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS to be around $10.7 billion, $1.075 billion and $11.25, up from previous projections of $10.4 billion, $990 million and $10.25, respectively. For the second quarter, Oshkosh expects adjusted EPS to be around $3 per share, up sequentially and year over year. It expects sales to be up approximately 15% versus the prior year.\n\nThe firm\u2019s balance sheet strength and investor-friendly moves also spark confidence. The total debt-to-capital ratio stands at 0.13, lower both in absolute and relative terms. In 2023, it hiked its dividend by 12.2%, which marked the tenth consecutive year of double-digit percentage increase.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Oshkosh repurchased nearly 130,000 shares of common stock worth $15 million.Additionally, the robust consolidated backlog of $16.35 billion provides enough visibility for the coming years. OSK also trades at a discount compared to the broader industry. It is trading at a forward sales multiple of 0.75, way below its high of 1.18 over the last five years. Considering all the factors, we are bullish on the stock.\n\nAnalysts have upwardly revised OSK\u2019s earnings outlook for the current fiscal. Over the past 30 days, EPS estimates for 2024 have moved up by 73 cents to $11.05, implying 10.7% growth year over year. Oshkosh currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of B.\n\nBorgWarner: This automotive parts supplier reported adjusted earnings of $1.03 per share for first-quarter 2024, down 5.5% year over year but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents. Net sales of $3.6 billion declined 13.9% year over year but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.52 billion.\n\nBWA has raised its full-year EPS guidance. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be within a range of $3.80-$4.15, up from $3.65 to $4.00 guided earlier. While it reaffirmed the sales forecast, the metric is expected to be between $14.4 billion to $14.9 billion, suggesting growth from $14.2 billion recorded in 2023. Frequent business wins are expected to drive top-line growth.BorgWarner\u2019s Charging Forward project to accelerate its electrification strategy bodes well. BorgWarner expects its 2024 eProduct sales in the band of $2.5-$2.8 billion, implying year-over-year growth of 25-40%, with high demand for battery systems being the main driver.\n\nBWA's manageable leverage and high liquidity are other positives. At the end of the first quarter of 2024, its long-term debt ratio was 0.35, improving from 0.38 at the end of 2023. Also, BorgWarner remains committed to maximizing shareholders\u2019 value.\n\nAlong with its earnings release, the company also authorized an additional $500 million stock repurchase to be executed over the next three years. While the expected decline in light and commercial vehicle production could decelerate BorgWarner\u2019s organic growth rate in the near term, there are several positives about BorgWarner that lead us to believe in its long-term prospects. BWA is valued at a discount compared to the broader industry. It is trading at a forward sales multiple of 0.56, below its median of 0.64 over the last five years.\n\nAnalysts have also upwardly revised BWA\u2019s earnings outlook for the current fiscal. Over the past seven days, EPS estimates for 2024 have moved up by 8 cents to $4.02, implying 7.2% growth year over year. BorgWarner currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Value Score of A.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "The 3 Best EV Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "Electric vehicle (EV) stocks have sparked divisive opinions among investors over the past few years. Though some feel that EVs still boast significant growth potential, others remain skeptical. Hence, given the market uncertainty, it may be an opportune time to pounce on the best EV stocks to buy.\n\nThe sector is up against multiple obstacles at this time, with the industry\u2019s finest shedding a ton of value. You know when a sector is in duress when the bellwethers post year-over-year (YOY) growth in deliveries yet are panned by investors. Additionally, we\u2019ve seen the attempts to lower EV prices haven\u2019t had the desired effect EV companies would\u2019ve wanted. Price reductions have, comically, led to consumers delaying purchases in anticipation of further declines. Nevertheless, a few players still stand out despite the industry turmoil. The article covers the three best EV stocks to buy in the current investing environment.\n\nLi Auto (LI) The steering wheel and dashboard inside Li Auto electric car. Interior of Li Auto EV. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is a leading Chinese automotive player focusing on high-end smart electric and hybrid vehicles. It is one of the fastest-growing EV companies worldwide, with deliveries increasing by over 1,000% from 2020 to 376,030 units last year. What separates Li from its competition is its superior execution and solid financial position.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs per its latest earnings print, the company had a colossal cash buffer of $14.6 billion, considering it had just $512 million in cash back in 2019. This emphatic result has everything to do with its rapid growth rates, which have averaged over 500% in the past five years. Another major positive for the firm is that it\u2019s profitable on a net profit basis. Profitability has proven elusive for some of the biggest in the EV realm and is perhaps the biggest edge for Li. Moreover, its robust bottom-line position will come in handy as it looks to navigate the current pricing war in China.\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) is a no-brainer for any EV stocks to buy list. It has ascended the ranks in the EV industry at an impressive pace, arguably becoming the most illustrious growth story in automotive history. It continues to outperform industry pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in terms of deliveries and margins despite operating in a hotly competitive Chinese EV market.\n\nMoreover, BYD\u2019s global aspirations are bound to ruffle some feathers among Tesla\u2019s executive team. BYD is laying the groundwork for international expansion, with massive investments in EV charging infrastructure to tighten its market hold further. With easing demand, it could turn things up a notch or two as far as its top-line growth is concerned.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking of which, it reported 936,446 sales in passenger vehicles on a year-to-date basis earlier this month, with a roughly 18% jump in pure EV sales to 434,579. Despite the market headwinds, such growth says something about the quality of BYD\u2019s business.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) Person holding smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is arguably the best pick-and-shovel EV play, currently trading at a deep discount. The lithium miner hosts one of the largest lithium projects in history, which could potentially power one million EVs annually. LAC stock, though, has lost its sheen over the past few months, trading more than 75% lower than its peak of $24.31. Moreover, it dipped 31% year-to-date, trading in penny stock territory.\n\nThe company is pushing forward to reach full operational capacity at its much-talked-about Thacker Pass Project in Northern Nevada. Construction started early last year and plans to go full-steam ahead in the latter half of 2024. It aims to achieve full productive capacity by 2028, extracting a whopping $3.9 billion in lithium. Moreover, following a massive $2.26 billion commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy and a prior investment from General Motors (NYSE:GM), it has enough resources to switch on the afterburners.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search General Motors Company (GM): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "General Motors (GM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this an automotive manufacturer have returned +4.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors falls in, has lost 2.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nGeneral Motors is expected to post earnings of $2.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +35.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +14.2%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $9.40 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +22.4%. This estimate has changed +3.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.51 indicates a change of +1.2% from what General Motors is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for General Motors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor General Motors, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $44.94 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $174.72 billion and $175.39 billion estimates indicate +1.7% and +0.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGeneral Motors reported revenues of $43.01 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.6%. EPS of $2.62 for the same period compares with $2.21 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.29 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.18%. The EPS surprise was +25.96%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGeneral Motors is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Can GM Steal Ford's Secret Weapon?",
        "content": "They say imitation is \"the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness,\" and that might be playing out between Detroit's two largest automakers right now. General Motors(NYSE: GM) has seen the success of Ford Motor Company(NYSE: F) in one specific aspect, but can it copy that?\n\nWhat's Ford doing?\n\nA decade ago, investors almost viewed an automaker's fleet and commercial business as dirty work. This segment was seen as a way to sell unwanted cars at marked-down prices to fleets of rental companies and the like, often at little to no margin. But now, if you take a look at the figures, Ford's commercial business is honestly eye-opening.\n\nLet's quickly compare Ford's traditional business, Ford Blue, and its commercial business, Ford Pro. You might think Ford's traditional business would dwarf its sister business, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIn 2023, Ford Blue generated $7.46 billion in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), while Ford Pro generated a similar $7.22 billion. Here's where it gets more intriguing, though: Ford Blue generated a 7.3% EBIT margin -- which is respectable in the mainstream auto business -- while Ford Pro generated a much more profitable 12.4% EBIT margin. Let's also note that in 2023, Ford Pro grew its revenue at a 19% clip compared to Ford Blue's 8%.\n\nThe lesson here is that Ford's commercial business is extremely valuable and growing quickly. And, to be sure, GM took notice of these results. That's what brought on its move a little while back.\n\nWhat's GM doing?\n\nAlmost exactly a year ago, GM launched GM Envolve, \"a new era of rapid growth by giving business customers more ways to help reduce their environmental impact, streamline fleet operations and increase driver safety.\" Essentially, the change will give GM's customers access to a single account executive who will simplify the purchasing experience, backed by a team that will create a package of GM's products, technologies, and solutions for each individual business. Furthermore, GM Envolve will incrementally increase its business by giving business customers access to segments focusing on mobility, energy, delivery, insight, and growth.\n\nWhat it all means\n\nFor decades, the automotive business has been known for being capital intensive and generating low margins, and this surge in commercial business could be the key to unlocking higher margins -- as Ford Pro has proven.\n\nGM has already taken the first step, and it's seeing some success already. In 2023 GM's fleet sales rose 20%, with deliveries to governments up 28% -- the highest level in more than a decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, GM is pushing its OnStar business to offer technologies and services to its commercial customers. The automaker believes it can bring in $20 billion to $25 billion in annual revenue from software and subscription services by 2030.\n\nIf GM can steal a page out of Ford's playbook here, it'll be a smart and profitable move, and -- looking back at how commercial business was viewed a decade ago -- one that investors should really applaud.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ford Motor Company right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ford Motor Company, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ford Motor Company wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "America's love affair with the SUV is killing the trusty sedan",
        "content": "The Chevy Malibu has gone the way of the dodo.\n\nThe long-running Malibu nameplate has had two separate runs with Chevrolet, with its first stint dating back 50 years. GM sold 10 million Malibus during its time, but in recent days it's a rarity \u2014 a sedan.\n\nGM (GM) said the Malibu factory space will now be devoted to making more crossovers, SUVs, and EVs.\n\n\u201cThe Chevy Malibu fell victim to consumers\u2019 shifts from traditional sedans to crossovers of all shapes and sizes. GM also needed room at its Kansas City factory to build the next-generation Chevy Bolt EV,\u201d Autoblog editor in chief Greg Migliore told Yahoo Finance. The Cadillac XT4 SUV will be built at the Kansas City factory as well. \u201cSo you can see the hierarchy, and midsize sedans like the Malibu are at the bottom for Chevy and its buyers.\u201d\n\nCase in point: Take a look at any mall parking lot or airport pickup zone, where SUVs and sporty crossovers dominate the terrain. (Disclosure: Autoblog is owned by Yahoo Finance parent Yahoo.) 2019 Chevrolet Malibu is on display at the 111th Annual Chicago Auto Show at McCormick Place in Chicago, Illinois, on Feb. 7, 2019. (Raymond Boyd/Getty Images) (Raymond Boyd via Getty Images)\n\n\"Crossovers are a simple choice for many consumers. They do many things well, combining functionality with agreeable driving dynamics to reach a wide swath of the market,\" Migliore adds. \"Broadly speaking, the crossover segment is the appliance section of the car business: a safe choice you don\u2019t need to think about too much.\"\n\nWhile mainstream automakers like Toyota with the Camry, Honda with its long-running Accord, and Hyundai with the Sonata soldier on with midsize sedan sales, GM, Ford, and Stellantis have, for the most part, exited the market due to dwindling sales. The Japanese and Korean automakers produce sedans because they can make money on them through cost efficiencies and scale, but that pie is getting smaller.\n\nSales data provided to Yahoo Finance from automotive research site Edmunds.com shows that from 2019 to 2023, the overall market share of new \u201ccars\u201d (made up mostly of sedans, but also coupes) sold in the US fell by nearly a third, from 27.1% to 20.5%. In particular, midsize cars fell from a market share of 8.2% to 5.8%, and that of compact cars fell from 8.8% to 6.1%.\n\nMeanwhile, the overall sales of SUVs ballooned to 56.3% in 2023 from an already robust 48.5% in 2019, basically taking over half the market. Gains were across the board, with notable moves in compact SUVs (18.8% from 17.9%) and midsize SUVs (16.6% from 15.9%).\n\n\"Popularity of sedans has steadily declined as carmakers have expanded and enhanced their SUV portfolios across multiple segments and budgets,\" said Joseph Yoon, Edmunds' consumer insights analyst, to Yahoo Finance. \"Customers have signaled loud and clear with their wallets that they crave an elevated seating position and the perceived added utility in every segment, whether they need it or not.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the perception that SUVs are generally more practical and Americans\u2019 predilections for big, brutish SUVs, the sedan body still has a lot to offer consumers. Size-wise, the Camry and Accord can sit four to five adults comfortably, with trunk space that can swallow up several full-size suitcases, comparable to a midsize SUV.\n\nWith their smaller footprint, more aerodynamic body, and overall smaller weight, sedans are more fuel efficient than similarly sized SUVs and crossovers and emit less pollutants. According to the latest EPA automotive trends report, truck-based SUVs produced a whopping 364 grams/mile of CO\u2082 emissions, whereas cars produced 260 grams. While overall miles-per-gallon levels are improving for SUVs versus cars, they still tend to pollute more.\n\nIn addition, better aerodynamics, less weight on the wheels, and a lower center of gravity can mean better on-road performance. Sedans like the high-performance BMW M5 and Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing can run circles around the sportiest SUV. The 2025 Cadillac CT5 is shown at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Wednesday, Sept. 13, 2023. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn the upper echelons of the auto market, some sedans continue to thrive because of their strong performance, size, and looks. The aforementioned BMW M5 isn\u2019t going anywhere, and the CT5-V Blackwing has been a sales winner for Cadillac.\n\nSedans also tend to be more affordable. Edmunds' data finds that the transaction price for midsize cars like a Camry or Accord averages $32,029, compared to $48,706 for a midsize SUV like a Kia Telluride or Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nEven Stellantis' Dodge Charger sedan is still seeing sales success in its last model year compared to the Malibu.\n\n\u201cFord and Chevy haven\u2019t been able to win with sedans in years, so [killing the Malibu] is a logical move. But all they have to do is look across town at Dodge and the success the Charger has had for two decades to see how a distinctive product can make consumers want to buy an American sedan,\u201d Migliore said.\n\nMigliore notes even after its cancellation, the Malibu name could make a comeback in a revised form (again).\n\nPerhaps GM will split the difference and give weary sedan fans a rejuvenated Malibu. After all, if the venerable Mustang name can be repurposed as an electric crossover, why can\u2019t there be an electrified Malibu sedan for the 21st century?\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Ford (NYSE:F) delivered respectable first-quarter results that missed Wall Street\u2019s top line expectations and beat bottom-line forecasts. The automaker also kept its full-year guidance in place, leaving the market holding its breath about where Ford stock heads next.\n\nThe auto industry isn\u2019t running as strong as it once was, and government electric vehicle mandates keep undermining carmakers\u2019 progress. The market for EVs isn\u2019t anywhere near as big as starry-eyed analysts and politicians once believed and it is leading to wasteful, loss inducing operations.\n\nWhile Ford needs to put a smiley face on its EV efforts to satisfy regulators, it also puts more resources into gasoline-powered engines. That bodes well for Ford stock as consumers want the reliability the internal combustion engine brings. They are also more profitable vehicles, which will hasten Ford\u2019s ongoing turnaround.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nShifting Gears on EVs\n\nFord delivered $42.8 billion in first-quarter revenue, just shy of analyst expectations of $42.9 billion. Earnings of 49 cents per share easily beat forecasts of 43 cents but were down 22% from the year-ago period.\n\nManagement reiterated its full-year guidance for operating profits between $10 billion to $12 billion but expects to generate $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion in free cash flow, slightly above its previous outlook for $6 billion to $7 billion. That is because Ford is backing away from its full battery-electric vehicles and building more hybrids.\n\nToyota Motors (NYSE:TM) is carrying the entire auto industry. It saw a massive 20% jump in sales volume in the first quarter as hybrid vehicle sales continued stealing from the competition.\n\nToyota guessed early on that BEVs were a horrible choice to go all-in on, so it chose hybrids instead that gave buyers the gasoline-powered reliability they were looking for while giving a green sheen to the purchase.\n\nElectrified vehicles (yes, Toyota makes a few BEVs) now account for 36.6% of its total sales. Ford, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and other car manufacturers saw the light.\n\nFord said in its full-year outlook that its \u201ccommitment to capital discipline and efficiency \u2026 match investments in support of electric vehicles to revised expectations for the pace of EV adoption by customers.\u201d Basically, buyers don\u2019t want \u2019em and we\u2019re not building \u2019em. At least not as many as before.\n\nAdopting a Hybrid Model\n\nFord\u2019s hybrid sales were up 36% in Q1 and are on track for 40% growth over the full year. The Maverick is the country\u2019s bestselling hybrid truck, and Ford is now also delivering full-size hybrid trucks to customers. Ford says it is committed to making hybrid versions of every vehicle it produces in North America by the end of the decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts lineup of three-row BEVs has also been pushed back from a 2025 launch to 2027. Basically, Ford is waiting for new battery technology to catch up to market demands before sinking more money into their development.\n\nThe Model E segment, which houses Ford\u2019s BEV business, saw revenue fall for the quarter while producing $1.3 billion in operating losses.\n\nFord maintains costs will ease as the year progresses, but the top line will continue to suffer. In the meantime, it will be full steam ahead on hybrids. Lesson learned!\n\nThe Bottom Line on Ford Stock\n\nThe auto industry is slowing down. April new vehicle sales finished below expectations despite the big sales gains from Toyota and its Lexus division. Sales only looked as good as they did because of Toyota. Full-year sales run rate of 15.7 million was up 0.4% from last year but was below expectations.\n\nNotably, dealer lot inventory was 50% higher this year than it was a year ago. While that speaks to the shortages that plagued the industry finally easing (even as they padded automaker profits), it means sales should have been much higher.\n\nThe higher-for-longer interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve could weigh heavily on auto sales. Making financing more expensive is not a sales booster.\n\nFord is also losing sales to foreign rivals, notably Toyota. It\u2019s reminiscent of how Japan\u2019s automakers beat Detroit in the 1980s by giving drivers fuel-efficient cars when U.S. manufacturers were producing gas guzzlers.\n\nNow they\u2019re giving them more desirable hybrid vehicles while Detroit clings to BEVs.\n\nHigher costs from interest rates and resurgent labor unions will also undermine Ford\u2019s turnaround. The automaker is learning some lessons pretty quickly, but it won\u2019t see a full recovery for many years yet as a result. Investors might want to wait before getting in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The auto sector is entering an exciting and more lucrative era. That\u2019s because automakers are starting to charge subscription fees for high-tech services. I believe that these companies will soon also start offering to track the well-being of various components within vehicles in exchange for fees. Which may transform them into the one of the best auto stocks investors want to buy. Of course, for the owners of electric vehicles, keeping informed about the welfare and needs of their EV\u2019s batteries is extremely important. As a result, I\u2019m sure that many owners will be willing to pay to stay on top of those matters.\n\nImportantly, most consumers seem willing to pay monthly fees for services within their vehicles. But they often like to try out these services first. In July 2023, S&P polled roughly 4,500 consumers who had a free trial or a subscription for services within their vehicles. More than 80% of the respondents said they would\u00a0consider purchasing subscription-based services in the future. For investors who want to profit from this trend, here are the three best auto stocks to buy.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Cadillac car and SUV dealership. Cadillac offers a full line of gas and electric EV vehicles. GM stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nModern electric vehicles are much more computerized than their gas-powered counterparts. Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID) CEO Peter Rawlinson explained in 2021 that computing has become central to vehicles, especially EVs. As a result, it\u2019s much easier to offer software-based services through EVs than gas-powered vehicles. Consequently, automakers that sell many EVs will be much better positioned to offer software subscriptions.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmong the veteran automakers, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is one of the best positioned firms to become a top seller of EVs. Sales of the Cadillac Lyriq luxury SUV jumped 500% last quarter year-over-year to 5,800. The Chevrolet Bolt was a top-selling EV in the U.S before it was taken off the market. However, GM is slated to release a retooled version of the Bolt next year. Moreover, the automaker has begun selling electric versions of many of its most popular trucks and SUVs. I believe that these will become best sellers in the longer term. Boding well for the future, GM expects its North American EV business to enter the black in the second half of this year.\n\nFinally, GM reported very strong first-quarter results, has a very low valuation, and is returning a great deal of cash to its shareholders.\n\nRivian (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green color\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nHow can anyone not love a company that\u2019s an integral partner of both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)?\n\nStory continues\n\nIt appears that EV maker Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) could be on the verge of achieving that huge milestone. As of last October, the start-up had provided Amazon with 10,000 of the delivery vans that the e-commerce giant has ordered. And tech website DigiTimes recently reported that Apple is considering forming a partnership with Rivian.\n\nSuch an alliance would certainly make sense for Apple. Obviously, the software behemoth is interested in selling products via EVs. And Rivian is one of the top American EV-oriented firms.\n\nMeanwhile, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe did not deny that the automaker could partner with Apple. He even noted that his company has a history of partnerships.\u00a0Given these points, I think there\u2019s a very high chance of the two firms forming an alliance. Such a deal should prove to be very lucrative for Rivian.\n\nVinFast (VFS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of Vietnamese car manufacturer VinFast (VFS) on screen in front of business web page.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nVinFast (NASDAQ:VFS) is a Vietnam-based EV startup that\u2019s growing very rapidly and has a semi-secret weapon. Last quarter the company\u2019s sales soared 270% YOY to $302.65 million. Meanwhile, its EV deliveries jumped 444% YOY to 9,689.\n\nThe automaker\u2019s semi-secret weapon is its alliance with Israeli EV battery maker StoreDot. The company\u2019s batteries will be utilized by VinFast\u2019s commercially available vehicles starting next year.\n\nAnother EV maker, Polestar (NASDAQ:PSNY), recently reported that a test they conducted showed that StorDot\u2019s battery can add 200 miles worth of charge in just 10 minutes.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in RIVN and AMZN.The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "Despite the inflation concerns and the market ups and downs, 2024 will be a much better year for investors compared to 2023. The current market situation may not seem like it,\u00a0but\u00a0we\u2019ve seen better days in the past few months. The earnings season is boosting the stock market,\u00a0and\u00a0the outlook could improve as we progress through the year.\u00a0This\u00a0is an ideal time to move away from the hot and attractive stocks and look at the undervalued sleeper stocks with high upside potential.\n\nAn early-mover advantage can reap significant benefits for you. Here are three undervalued sleeper stocks that can be solid bets this month. With at least one rate cut anticipated in the year, the financial environment will improve,\u00a0and\u00a0these stocks could benefit. They are cheap and have a substantial upside. Let\u2019s take a look at three undervalued sleeper stocks.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Cadillac car and SUV dealership. Cadillac offers a full line of gas and electric EV vehicles. GM stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nLegacy automaker General Motors (NYSE:GM)\u00a0isn\u2019t new to the business,\u00a0and\u00a0the company has seen several market ups and downs. It survived inflation and is bouncing back with\u00a0strong\u00a0results. It beat expectations and reported a\u00a0revenue of $43 billion, up 7.6% year-over-year. The net income increased to $2.9 billion, up 26% YOY. The increase\u00a0was driven\u00a0by a rise in truck sales,\u00a0which\u00a0saw a 7.4% YOY jump.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAfter the strong results, the management has increased the guidance for the year and expects adjusted earnings in the range of $12.5 billion to $14.5 billion, up from $12 billion to $14 billion. It also expects a higher free cash flow of $8.5 billion to $10.5 billion.\n\nThe company was pivoting towards electrification, but the sector\u2019s slump\u00a0has left it worried about how to move forward.\u00a0For now, the EV rollout looks like it is on track. However, with a strong presence in the combustion-powered vehicle industry, General Motors can keep growing revenue while finding ground in the EV sector.\n\nTrading at $45, GM looks like an undervalued stock to me. It also enjoys a dividend yield of 1.07%. While it is at the 52-week high, the company has ample potential to expand. It just proved that it\u00a0can\u00a0grow despite competition in the industry. Over half a dozen analysts have raised the stock\u2019s price target after\u00a0strong\u00a0results.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) Robinhood (HOOD) app and logo on screen. Robinhood financial services company. The company offers mobile app and website that offers people the ability to invest in stocks\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nHaving faced backlash in the GameStop (NYSE:GME)\u00a0short squeeze during 2021, Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) struggled with its image for a long time. These image problems are slowly vanishing,\u00a0and\u00a0users have started to trust the platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nRobinhood reported record revenue and deposits in the\u00a0first-quarter results. Up 40% YOY, the revenue stood at $618\u00a0million,\u00a0and\u00a0the net deposits reached $11.2 billion. The higher revenue\u00a0was driven\u00a0by the crypto revenue,\u00a0which\u00a0more than tripled.\u00a0This\u00a0was its second straight profitable quarter with net income at $157 million.\n\nTwo important metrics impressed investors. The subscribers increased by 42% YOY, a 500,000 increase to end the quarter with 1.7 million users,\u00a0and\u00a0the average revenue per user hit $104, up 35% YOY.\u00a0This\u00a0is impressive growth,\u00a0and\u00a0long-term investors should focus on the fact that Robinhood is seeing steady user growth. The company has always aggressively acquired users, and its efforts have paid off. Its monthly active users also reported a 16% jump.\n\nOnce a brokerage platform, the company has moved toward offering unique financial products and services that have attracted new users. It already has over 1 million users on the 3% cash-back credit card waitlist.\n\nTrading at $17 today, HOOD is an undervalued sleeper stock that can double over the next 12 months. The stock is up 12% YTD and 125% in the past\u00a0six\u00a0months. The concerns about the\u00a0Wells notice\u00a0are overblown,\u00a0and\u00a0an upside from the current level is\u00a0certain.\n\nRobinhood is one of the best fintech stocks to own as the economy improves.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese automaker Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) has been a frontrunner in the electric vehicle race since 2023. The company impressed the market with\u00a0strong\u00a0delivery numbers and fundamentals. However, the slump in the industry since the beginning of the year slowed its momentum. Li Auto might be down,\u00a0but\u00a0it is not out,\u00a0and\u00a0the undervalued sleeper stock has the potential to generate multi-bagger returns.\n\nLi Auto has launched\u00a0Li L6, a five-seater premium family SUV, and\u00a0is set\u00a0to launch lower-priced Li L7 and Li L8 variants this month. The company is steadily working on the launch of new models, which helps improve deliveries. In April, it reported deliveries of\u00a025,787 vehicles, up 0.4% YOY.\n\nLi Auto ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $14.6 billion and a revenue of $5.88 billion, up 136% YOY. The liquidity allows the company to aim for higher growth, and it hasn\u2019t considered global expansion yet. If Li Auto aims to go\u00a0global, it will see massive growth across EV markets.\n\nTrading at $27 today, the stock has dropped 21% YTD and gone from the high of $45 to $27.\u00a0This\u00a0is your chance to grab the multi-bagger before it explodes. My InvestorPlace colleague,\u00a0Faisal\u00a0Humayun,\u00a0thinks\u00a0the stock could double before the end of the year.\n\nNew launches, healthy delivery growth, and strong fundamentals make Li an ideal addition to your portfolio. The company reports first-quarter earnings on May 20.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, I\u2019m more concerned about providing readers with good long-term bets.\n\nHere are my three choices for this spring and beyond.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt the time of writing, General Motors (NYSE:GM) trades at $45.36, up nearly 2% over the past five days. GM stock has done well over the past week because of positive earnings news.\n\nOn April 23, it reported a 7.6% revenue increase for Q1 2024, to $43.01 billion, with a net income of $2.98 billion, 24.4% higher than a year ago. As a result of the strong start, it raised its 2024 guidance to $10.8 billion in net income at the midpoint of its outlook, $300 million higher than previously.\n\nAnalysts expected it to earn $2.12 a share; it beat that by 48 cents. Revenues beat the consensus by $600 million.\n\n\u201cIn January, we outlined clear priorities for GM in 2024. They are to leverage the strength of our winning ICE portfolio, grow our EV business profitably, advance our software-defined vehicle capability, and relaunch Cruise safely while delivering strong margins and cash flows,\u201d stated CEO Mary Barra in the company\u2019s Q1 2024 Letter to Shareholders.\n\nI\u2019ve been critical of Barra\u2019s pay in the past. However, she\u2019s delivering outstanding results for shareholders.\n\nBrown-Forman (BF-B) a row of glass alcohol bottles to represent sin stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBrown-Forman (NYSE:BF-B) trades at $47.30, down nearly 2% over the past five days. More importantly, over the past five years, it barely generated a positive return for its shareholders, generating a five-year annualized total return, which includes dividends, of less than 1%.\n\nThe reason for the underperformance is apparent: it\u2019s not growing.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that this is a problem industrywide. Diageo (NYSE:DEO), one of the world\u2019s largest alcohol beverage companies, has suffered under the same fate in recent times. In early March, Diageo reported Q3 2024 results that were less than flattering from a revenue perspective, with a 1% decline in sales to $1.07 billion, $60 million less than analyst expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn comparison, Brown-Forman\u2019s bottom line was much better, increasing by 185% to $285 million, or $0.60 a share, four cents higher than the consensus.\n\nAs part of its Q3 2024 report, CEO Lawson Whiting said that the company expects the U.S. spirits market to return to more normalized annual revenue growth of 4%-5%. It slowed over the past 12-18 months due to consumers reducing spending combined with heavier-than-normal inventories coming out of the pandemic.\n\nI\u2019ve always liked this company because of its family ownership. In May 2013, I recommended it and three other family-owned publicly traded businesses. Its total return from 2013 isn\u2019t as good as the other three, but because of its correction since the beginning of 2021, it\u2019s not nearly as impressive.\n\nAs the company said in its Investor Day presentation in March, it has four strategic priorities for its business through 2032: Grow the number of geographic markets it\u2019s in, attract new and younger drinkers, grab market share in the super-premium category, and grow its flavored drinks and RTD (ready-to-drink) product lines.\n\nDelta Air Lines (DAL) Delta (DAL) Airplanes sit in a row at Kansas City International Airport\n\nSource: David Peterlin / Shutterstock.com\n\nDelta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) trades at $52.62, up 4.2% over the past five days.\u00a0Earlier in this spring, I recommended buying DAL stock as we enter the summer season. People will travel today, tomorrow, and every day thereafter.\n\nAs I wrote in my commentary, it projected a 2024 free cash flow of $3.5 billion, giving it a free cash flow yield of 6.7%, verging on value territory, despite its stock gaining 52% over the past year.\u00a0Regarding management, they have top talent. CEO Ed Bastian isn\u2019t just one of the best airline executives; he\u2019s one of America\u2019s best CEOs.\n\nInterestingly, I didn\u2019t realize until writing this that Alain Bellemare, former CEO of Canada\u2019s Bombardier (OTCMKTS:BDRBF), was hired by Delta to be executive vice president in January 2021. He did a reasonably good job at Bombardier despite a challenging situation where it had to sell its C-Series aircraft to Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY) for the Canadian-made plane to survive and thrive as the A220.\n\nOf all the U.S. airline stocks, Delta is my favorite.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Sector Superstars: 3 Stocks Generating the Most Buzz on Wall Street",
        "content": "During this earnings season, Wall Street investors have been paying attention to stocks generating buzz in different sectors. Diversifying investments across the 11 sectors within theS&P 500 index could help weather short-term market volatility.\n\nOver the past 12 months, the best performing sector has been information technology, returning well over 30%. Consumer discretionary sector with nearly 20% follows it, and the health care sector holds over 6%. By comparison, the S&P 500 index, which represents the broader market, has advanced around 24%.\n\nTherefore, investors can explore three companies that have demonstrated resilience and adaptability in different sectors despite the economic and geopolitical uncertainties. These companies have the ability to thrive in the face of market challenges and capitalize on industry trends. Moreover, these stocks currently offer attractive entry points for long-term investors with their moderate valuations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s now delve into these three stocks generating buzz to understand the reasons they could be compelling investment opportunities.\n\nAmgen (AMGN)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBiotech giant Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) offers a diverse product portfolio and promising clinical pipeline. The company specializes in treatment of inflammation, oncology, cardiovascular disease and rare diseases.\n\nOn May 1, AMGN shares rallied over 10% in after-hours trading after the company announced first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings results. This included an update on its weight-loss drug candidates. Revenue jumped 22% year-over-year (YOY) to $7.45 billion.\u00a0Yet, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) fell by 1% YOY to $3.96 per share, due to costs related to its Horizon Therapeutics acquisition.\n\nStrong first quarter results suggest that the company can maintain revenue growth despite looming patent expiries through 2030. Ten products delivered at least double-digit volume growth in the first quarter. For 2024, management is guiding for robust revenue growth of more than 20% as well.\n\nAlso, investors should note that the biotech company offers a potential way to gain exposure to the booming weight-loss drug market. With Phase 2 results expected in late 2024, Amgen\u2019s injectable GLP-1 weight-loss drug candidate MariTide represents a key potential upside catalyst. Furthermore, MariTide is forecast to have annual sales as high as $4 billion.\n\nYear-to-date (YTD), AMGN stock is up 8%. Shares are changing hands at 16 times adjusted forward earnings and 5.6 times trailing sales. In addition, they generate a respectable 2.9% annualized yield. In addition, analysts\u2019 12-month average price target suggests an upside potential of 3% from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) First Solar logo on smartphone in front of computer screen with graphs. FSLR stock\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext up is First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), which provides photovoltaic solar energy solutions worldwide. With the transition to renewable energy gaining momentum, the company has become a preferred choice within clean energy.\n\nRecently, First Solar delivered robust first quarter fiscal 2024 results. Revenue soared 45% YOY to $794 million, surpassing expectations by 13%. Additionally, EPS skyrocketed to $2.20, up from 40 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. Investors were pleased to see that management maintained its full-year guidance and underscored ongoing investments in technology and capacity expansion. Also, FSLR highlighted the potential for adding new factories and underscored its strong sales backlog of 78.3 GW through 2030.\n\nAnalysts point out that First Solar\u00a0is poised for further growth as the demand for renewable energy solutions grow worldwide. Its advanced thin-film module technology continues to gain market share. Specifically, increasing electricity consumption from data centers act as a key growth driver for the manufacturer.\n\nAs a result of these developments, FSLR stock is up 11% YTD. Shares support a valuation of 14 times forward earnings and 5.7 times trailing sales. Meanwhile, Wall Street\u2019s 12-month price targets imply\u00a0an upside potential of 20% from current levels.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutomotive giant General Motors (NYSE:GM) is pursuing an all-electric future. Its diversification efforts include strategic investments in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous driving technology. This serves to highlight GM\u2019s commitment to leading the automotive transformation worldwide.\n\nAlso, the automaker reported strong first quarter fiscal 2024 metrics and raised its full-year guidance. Revenue increased 8% YOY to $43 billion.\u00a0GM\u2019s sales and pricing contributed to robust profit margins despite higher interest rates. U.S. retail sales grew 6% without resorting to significant price cuts and incentives. And, adjusted EPS jumped 19% YOY to $2.62.\n\nRecently, GM\u2019s focus on EVs and autonomous vehicles has become a key growth driver, suggesting upside potential for long term profits. The automaker reported significant progress regarding its Ultium EV platform. Production increased and battery costs declined, leading to improved profitability. GM increased battery module production by 300% over the past six months and expects to double its overall EV production by late summer. Meanwhile, the company emphasizes connected vehicle software and subscription services. This underscores its aim to unlock recurring revenue opportunities beyond traditional vehicle sales.\n\nSince January, GM stock is up 25%. The company\u2019s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at an attractive 4.9. And, its trailing price-to-sales ratio is just 0.3, offering a bargain valuation for long term investors. Finally, analysts\u2019 12-month price targets suggest an upside potential of around 15% from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "(Adds details, background in paragraphs 3-5)\n\nBy David Shepardson\n\nMay 8 (Reuters) - General Motors said Wednesday it will end production of its gasoline-powered Chevrolet Malibu car later this year in order to produce new electric vehicles.\n\nGM has sold more than 10 million Malibus since 1964 worldwide and will end production in November. The Detroit automaker is investing $390 million at its Kansas assembly plant to build next-generation Chevrolet Bolt EVs. GM halted production of the prior generation Bolt in December.\n\nGM has been shifting away from cars in favor of building more crossover and sport utility vehicles in recent years. The Malibu is the last remaining Chevrolet car offered in the United States besides the Corvette. GM ended production of the Chevrolet Camaro late last year.\n\nGM said separately Wednesday it will pause production of the Cadillac XT4 after January 2025 in Kansas, resulting in layoffs of production employees until production resumes in late 2025 for both the Bolt EV and XT4 on the same assembly line.\n\nSales of the Malibu were down 12.5% in the first three months of the year but up 13% to 130,000 in 2023.

        "title": "Rivian And Worksport Are Proof That Smaller Players Can Be A Disruptive Force",
        "content": "Rivian And Worksport Are Proof That Smaller Players Can Be A Disruptive Force\n\nWhile the EV industry is facing a slowdown amid an uncertain and turbulent economic climate, Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ: RIVN) and\u00a0Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP)\u00a0showed they continue their march towards an all-electric future by expanding their operations.\n\nWorksport just announced it got awarded a major grant.\n\nWorksport Ltd is aU.S.-based innovator commited to making clean energy solutions for light trucks and consumers in general. Through the Excelsior Jobs Program for job creation and wage support,\u00a0the State of New York awarded Worksport with a major grant worth up to $2.8MM.\n\nAlong with the world\u2019s first solar-powered tonneau cover SOLIS that Worksport will release this summer, it is also expanding its clean energy intellectual property portfolio with a portable battery system COR and\u00a0a high-performance extreme-climate heat pump.\u00a0The SOLIS tonneau cover is expected to be available for major brands, providing options for partnership with the EV King, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), as well as Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and General Motors (NYSE: GM), among others.\n\nIn April, Worksport already received a strategic low-cost power award from New York Power Authority. Worksport continues to rapidly expand its operations. Worksport expects to create up to or over 280 new jobs from 2025 until the end of this decade. If achieved, it will receive cash benefits for the creation of these jobs that will amount to $2.8MM received over the following decade.\n\nRivian surpassed Wall Street revenue estimates and kept its targets.\n\nFor its first quarter, Rivian reported revenue of\u00a0$1.2 billion, surpassing LSEG\u2019s $1.16 billion estimate. For the quarter that ended on March 31st, net loss widened from last year\u2019s comparable quarter when it amounted to $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion due to a three-week-long manufacturing halt during which Rivian upgraded its assembly line, which will reduce costs over the long haul.\u00a0\u00a0The loss of $1.24 per share was worse than LSEG\u2019s estimate of $1.17 per share loss.\n\nDue to sustained demand for its EVs, Rivian reiterated its annual production forecast of 57,000 units. Rivian also managed to lower its annual capital expenditure forecast by $550 million to $1.2 billion by deciding to start making its more affordable R2 midsize SUV at its Normal, Illinois plant, instead of beginning production at a proposed plant in Georgia. Unlike Tesla and its EV peers, Rivian did not succumb to discounting, but opted to introduce less expensive models. Despite being so much weaker than Tesla, it somehow shielded itself. Then again, Rivian did beat Tesla in being the first to bring an all-electric truck to life as the\u00a0R1T reached the road well before the Cybertruck.\n\nStory continues\n\nRivian and Worksport actually have something in common. They both tell a tale of how one does not have to be big to make a difference as very often, it is the small players who challenge the established norms by bringing innovation and creativity to the table.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "By David Shepardson\n\n(Reuters) -General Motors said Wednesday it will end production of its gasoline-powered Chevrolet Malibu car later this year in order to produce new electric vehicles.\n\nGM has sold more than 10 million Malibus since 1964 worldwide and will end production in November. The Detroit automaker is investing $390 million at its Kansas assembly plant to build next-generation Chevrolet Bolt EVs. GM halted production of the prior generation Bolt in December.\n\nGM has been shifting away from cars in favor of building more crossover and sport utility vehicles in recent years. The Malibu is the last remaining Chevrolet car offered in the United States besides the Corvette. GM ended production of the Chevrolet Camaro late last year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGM said separately Wednesday it will pause production of the Cadillac XT4 after January 2025 in Kansas, resulting in layoffs of production employees until production resumes in late 2025 for both the Bolt EV and XT4 on the same assembly line.\n\nSales of the Malibu were down 12.5% in the first three months of the year but up 13% to 130,000 in 2023.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Mark Potter)",

        "content": "With the equities sector generally flying higher, the concept of undervalued long-term stocks might seem a foreign one. Nevertheless, if you\u2019re willing to step away from the spotlight, you can still find compelling deals.\n\nEven better, certain ideas aren\u2019t just deflated in interim. Rather, the market simply appears to be ignoring the ideas mentioned below. For patient speculators, that\u2019s exactly what you want. If everybody decides to jump on the same opportunity, the ultimate upside potential may be limited.\n\nOn that note, below are intriguing ideas to consider for undervalued long-term stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDiscover Financial Services (DFS) the Discover (DFS) logo displayed outdoors\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDiscover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) through its subsidiaries provides digital banking products and services. It\u2019s arguably best known for its payment services in the domestic market. The company provides Discover-branded credit cards to individuals, along with other solutions such as student, personal and home loans, in addition to other consumer lending products.\n\nFundamentally, DFS presents a tricky narrative for undervalued long-term stocks to buy. Given the economic challenges we\u2019re in, high debt loads present the risk of rising delinquencies. On the other hand, the labor market (the April jobs report aside) has been relatively robust. As long as that\u2019s generally true, people may continue to turn to their credit cards to make ends meet. Cynically, that\u2019s a positive for DFS.\n\nNotably, shares also trade at 1.92X trailing-year revenue, below 65.38% of competitors in the credit services industry. Not only that, covering experts project fiscal 2024 revenue to reach $16.85 billion, up 6.2% from last year\u2019s haul of $15.86 billion.\n\nIn other words, DFS should be even more undervalued when stacked against forward sales.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logo\n\nSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of the top automotive giants in the world, General Motors (NYSE:GM) needs no introduction. However, it finds itself in a difficult situation regarding the topic of undervalued long-term stocks to buy. On paper, GM is super cheap. It trades for only 4.8X forward earnings, below 94.52% of its peers. It also trades hands at 0.33X trailing-year revenue, below the sector median 0.86X.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. GM has been making a strong pivot to electrification. That\u2019s understandable given how electric vehicles were seemingly about to take over the world. However, a sector fallout has left the auto industry unsure of how to respond. Many companies are scaling back their EV ambitions.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, because GM has a viable portfolio of combustion-powered vehicles, it enjoys flexibility. Once EVs start gaining positive momentum, the company could resume its directive. In the meantime, GM can focus on what consumers really want, which are hybrid vehicles.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate modest growth of 2.5% to $176.19 billion. Still, the high-side target hits $180.77 billion, which might not be unrealistic given the aforementioned push for hybrids.\n\nTD Synnex (SNX) A hexagonal grid with different tech-related icons; Tech stocks illustration. Best Tech stocks. tech stocks trading at bargain prices\n\nSource: whiteMocca / Shutterstock\n\nWhile several innovators have moved higher due to the technology boom, not all enterprises have benefited to the same degree. That\u2019s the case for TD Synnex (NYSE:SNX). Per its corporate profile, TD Synnex operates as a distributor and solutions aggregator for the information technology (IT) ecosystem. It provides myriad hardware solutions, including personal computing devices and peripherals, mobile phones and related accessories and printers.\n\nIn addition, TD Synnex provides endpoint technology software. It\u2019s also a heavy hitter in datacenter technologies, including hybrid cloud, security, storage, networking, servers and converged and hyper-converged infrastructure. Despite the importance of the enterprise, SNX isn\u2019t getting much love. For example, shares only trade at 0.19X trailing-year revenue, below 94.34% of the competition.\n\nTo be fair, there\u2019s not much growth anticipated for the current fiscal year. However, in 2025, sales could rise to $60.73 billion, up almost 5% from projected 2024 revenue. Also, the blue-sky target calls for $61.62 billion. With the company generally producing strong quarterly earnings results, SNX appears to be one of the undervalued long-term stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "It\u2019s tough to advocate for buying battery stocks at this point. With the slowdown in demand for EVs, we\u2019ve seen battery stocks sell-off over the past year or so. Consequently, prices of critical components such as lithium have declined sharply from their peak in 2022.\n\nNevertheless, with secular tailwinds powering at their back, the long-term bull case for battery stocks remains firmly in place. The EV sector is in recalibration mode, but the long-term electrification trend is unlikely to disappear anytime soon. Moreover, we\u2019ve seen a resurgence in the lithium market, where shiny metal prices are up by double-digit margins this year. A few experts believe that prices have bottomed out, and it may be time to load up on the best battery stocks to buy.\n\nBattery Stocks to Buy: Lithium Americas (LAC) Person holding smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC)\u00a0is arguably one of the best opportunities for multibagger gains in the lithium mining space. With the headwinds in the lithium market, LAC stock has fallen out of favor with investors, losing roughly 30% year-to-date (YTD). However, its stock performance has done little to deter its spirit, with LAC pushing along at a remarkable pace, reaching full production at the Thacker Pass Project in Northern Nevada. Construction began early last year, and things are likely to speed up in the second half of 2024. Moreover, the goal is to reach full capacity within the next four years, recovering a whopping $3.9 billion worth of lithium.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Thacker Pass project is a gold mine, to say the least, with an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion. Moreover, following a $2.26 billion financing commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy, it has secured enough funding for the first phase of its project. Moreover, adding to that is General Motors\u2019 (NYSE:GM) massive $650 million investment, and you have LAC in an excellent strategic position to advance its efforts.\n\nSolid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) is perhaps the best bet on solid-state batteries. Many have tried and failed to commercialize solid-state batteries, yet SLDP appears to have found the successful formula.\n\nSolid-state or forever batteries can be incredibly disruptive, especially in the EV space. These batteries are a class apart regarding charging speeds, safety, and energy density. Moreover, they have the potential to rejuvenate the current sluggishness in the EV market, taking things to the next level.\n\nStory continues\n\nSLDP has made some impressive strides over the past several years, delivering A-sample cells for its automotive partners to test out. Moreover, the goal is to develop superior A-2 sample cells, potentially delivering superior safety and performance. Also, with the backing of automotive titans in BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) and Ford (NYSE:F), it has the impetus to continue marching forward with aplomb. Encouragingly, SLDP stock has been trading in the green in the past six months, gaining 30% in the past six months.\n\nToyota (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutomotive giant Toyota (NYSE:TM) has been bucking broader market trends lately. Its stock is up almost 27%, trumping the S&P 500\u2019s return of 7.5%. Toyota\u2019s cautionary approach to EVs has paid off for its business, which has grown rapidly. The automaker has employed a pragmatic approach to electrification, playing the long game in expanding its position in the EV sector.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s been investing heavily in solid-state batteries, with a whopping $13.6 billion investment to advance its efforts. According to Toyota, these batteries are targeted for a 2027 release, boasting features such as 10-minute fast charging and ranges up to 750 miles. These features could prove game-changing, significantly enhancing vehicle range and efficiency while cutting costs by 50% by the late 2020s. Moreover, the goal is to integrate them into hybrids to manage teething issues, ensuring a more diversified approach to its vehicle lineup.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "GM or FOXF: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?",
        "content": "Investors interested in Automotive - Domestic stocks are likely familiar with General Motors (GM) and Fox Factory Holding (FOXF). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\n\nGeneral Motors has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Fox Factory Holding has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that GM likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than FOXF has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\n\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\n\nGM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 4.80, while FOXF has a forward P/E of 18.45. We also note that GM has a PEG ratio of 0.53. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 3.76.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for GM is its P/B ratio of 0.73. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, FOXF has a P/B of 1.55.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to GM's Value grade of A and FOXF's Value grade of C.\n\nGM sticks out from FOXF in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that GM is the better option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Just like Toyota Motor\u2019s (NYSE:TM) 1990s advertising jingle \u201cI love what you do for me, Toyota!,\u201d investors have been loving how much Toyota Motor stock has done to boost the value of their portfolios over the past year.\n\nSince last May, shares in the Japan-based global automaker have rallied by nearly 72%. These gains have handily beat those of other top-performing automotive stocks, like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA).\n\nMore strikingly, while TM is up by high double digits over the past year, during this same time frame shares in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are up by just 12.8%, and that\u2019s only after TSLA\u2019s latest supercharged rally that sparked a beginning of a rebound for the headwind-ladened EV maker.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet while you may regret not grabbing some Toyota shares twelve months ago, it\u2019s not too late. Even after this big run-up, shares remain a strong opportunity.\n\nA Closer Look at Toyota Motor Stock\n\nMake no mistake. It\u2019s not hope and hype that have driven TM stock\u2019s outsized price performance. Nor has it been because of the market overreacting to what can be only moderately positive operating performance.\n\nRather, the convincing performance of Toyota Motor stock is a reasonable response to stellar fiscal results. For instance, for the nine months ending Dec. 31, 2023, Toyota (in Japanese yen terms) reported a 23.9% jump in sales, as well as earnings growth of over 102%.\n\nYes, a weakening yen has played a role in this. However, even when accounting for a declining yen, in dollar terms this still represents a fantastic level of growth for the automobile manufacturer.\n\nA larger reason Toyota has performed so well has to do with the resurging popularity of gas-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles relative to battery electric vehicles.\n\nWhile initially seen as a risky move, this has instead proven to be a shrewd move for Toyota. It\u2019s been a key factor in its strong growth in recent quarters, and this growth has not slowed down. As the New York Times reported in March, Toyota\u2019s hybrid sales were up 83% during January and February.\n\nStill on a Smooth Path to Higher Prices\n\nInvestors have not gone overboard reacting to Toyota\u2019s recent growth. Still, one can counter that growth may be on the verge of slowing down.\n\nAfter all, forecasts call for earnings growth not only to slow down, but for the bottom to decline from $22.68 to $22.18 per share during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025.\n\nNot only that, Toyota continues to be cautious in its planned EV production ramp-up. However, much suggests that these forecasts are conservative, and concerns about Toyota\u2019s slow EV rollout are overblown.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs my InvestorPlace colleague Josh Enomoto recently argued, the popularity of hybrids among mileage and climate-conscious car buyers is likely to continue.\n\nThis strong hybrid sales growth could help prevent Toyota from experiencing the same sort of slump that competing automakers are experiencing. The key issues that have negatively affected EV demand, like low vehicle range and affordability, are still far away from being resolved.\n\nThis points to Toyota\u2019s cautious approach being a wise move rather than one that will prove shortsighted down the road. Still reasonably-priced at around 10.3 times forward earnings, further growth could keep Toyota Motor stock on a smooth path to higher prices.\n\nThe Verdict: Come Along for the Ride\n\nWhile I\u2019m bullish on TM, it\u2019s not as if I assume that another more than 75% move higher is in the cards for the automaker\u2019s shares.\n\nHowever, a moderate boost to earnings this fiscal year could produce stellar returns for this stock relative to the broad market. Besides the possibility of further gains on the table, TM\u2019s semiannual dividend could also provide a boost for total returns.\n\nLast year Toyota paid out dividends totaling around $4.50 per share. This represents about a 1.91% yield. While Toyota\u2019s dividend is variable, another strong year could produce similarly-sized payouts.\n\nLater this week, Toyota will release its full year fiscal 2023 results. You may want to wait until then to gather additional details on the company and its future prospects. That said, if earnings and updates prove promising, and the stock remains at reasonable prices, consider Toyota Motor stock still worth buying.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "To say the least, 2023 was a challenging year for auto manufacturers. That said, these issues limited upside, creating some undervalued auto stocks to buy.\n\nIndeed, last year was tough operationally for auto stocks. First, elevated interest rates squeezed subprime buyers out of the auto market, leaving only high-income, high-credit-quality buyers. The second challenge was the United Auto Workers strike, which created uncertainty.\n\nHowever, as we progress through 2024, the outlook for these undervalued auto stocks is improving. The union strike came to a positive resolution. And if anything, as long as unemployment remains below 4%, demand for autos will be resilient. Furthermore, with the Federal Reserve stating that rate hikes are unlikely, the financing environment could improve.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese undervalued auto stocks are still too cheap and present substantial upside for the rest of the year. They are generating significant free cash flow and using it to buy back stock.\n\nStellantis N.V. (STLA) Stellantis (STLA) logo at the transmission factory.

According to Finviz, it trades at a forward price-to-earnings of 4 and a trailing price-to-free cash flow of 5.\n\nStellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) is coming off another great year financially. For fiscal year 2023, it reported revenue of \u20ac189.5 billion ($204.5 billion), representing 5% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EPS also grew 7% YOY to \u20ac6.42 ($6.93).\n\nDespite the labor strike headwinds in 2023, industrial free cash flow generation was robust. The car maker generated about \u20ac12.9 billion ($13.9 billion) of free cash flow. Moreover, it returned a substantial portion, about \u20ac6.6 billion ($7.1 billion), in dividends and buybacks.\n\nAlthough Q1 sales were disappointing, falling 12%, the company plans to increase its battery-electric vehicle offerings. In 2024, it estimates it will add 18 BEVs, bringing its global portfolio to 48. Furthermore, the company sees double-digit adjusted operating income and positive industrial free cash flow.\n\nLastly, the company committed to an expanded capital return program on releasing full-year results on February 15. It set a \u20ac3 billion open market stock buyback and increased the dividend by 16%.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter delivering outstanding results recently, this Detroit automaker has garnered investor interest. Indeed, after topping revenue, EBIT and EPS estimates and issuing favorable guidance, General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock is one of the undervalued auto stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on Q1 2024 results, General Motors is firing on all cylinders. The top line grew 7.6% YOY from $39.9 billion to $43 billion. Net income also saw a huge lift from $2.3 billion to $2.9 billion. As a result, net income margins improved from 6.0% to 6.9%.\n\nEven better, the company issued guidance that surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectations. It raised its net income guidance to a range of $10.1 billion\u2014$11.5 billion, above the previous outlook of $9.8 billion\u2014$11.2 billion. It also raised its FY2024 adjusted diluted EPS to $9.00 \u2013 $10.00.\n\nThe impressive results and guidance led to several favorable notes. Analyst Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho raised the price target to $52 based on General Motors\u2019 leadership in SUVs and pickup trucks. He also called out the disciplined electric vehicle rollout. UBS also reiterated its \u201cbuy\u201d rating and raised the price target to $58, stating it was one of the best stories in autos.\n\nConsidering the rosy fundamentals, GM stock is one of the undervalued auto stocks today. At just 5 times forward earnings, it\u2019s dirt cheap and has substantial upside.\n\nToyota Motor (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) has been highly criticized for hesitancy in investing in electric vehicles, its strategic bet on hybrids is paying off. EV demand has slowed in 2024, but demand for hybrids, where the Japanese automaker is a leader, is surging.\n\nIndeed, Toyota\u2019s fortunes have improved as consumer skepticism of EVs has heightened. It\u2019s one of the largest sellers of hybrid vehicles globally and is seeing significant demand. As a result, TM stock is already up 26% year-to-date.\n\nThe strength of Toyota\u2019s product line is unmatched and results show it. For instance, March 2024 U.S. vehicle sales increased to 214,894 units, a 21.8% YOY growth rate. It is offering more electrified options that include hybrid powertrains to meet customer needs. As a result, electrified vehicle sales increased 36.4% to 78,157.\n\nGoing forward, the automaker will capitalize on hybrids. It plans to launch more than 20 editions with hybrid powertrain support. These new options suit consumers who prefer the flexibility of hybrids.\n\nToyota Motor\u2019s success in hybrids reflects the industry of the Japanese. For now, it is maintaining its lead in the auto market and its hybrid strategy is succeeding. At 10 times forward EPS, it\u2019s one of the most undervalued auto stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "New EV tax credit rules mean cars with Chinese materials won't qualify \u2014 but there's a catch",
        "content": "New rules from the Treasury Department will make it harder for vehicles to qualify for the full federal electric vehicle tax credit of $7,500, though automakers were also granted a reprieve.\n\nCurrently, the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s (IRA) federal EV credit requires that manufacturers ramp up sourcing of battery \"critical materials\" such as nickel and cobalt from the US and its trade partners and ensure that battery components are increasingly built in North America.\n\nIn addition to thresholds that increase over time for critical minerals, late last week Treasury released new rules mandating that manufacturers not use critical materials that originate from a Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) \u2014 including China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran \u2014 by 2025 if they want to receive the full EV tax credit.\n\nThe White House's goal with the mandates was to reduce the industry's reliance on battery materials and components from China. China\u2019s chokehold over battery mineral production is the main concern for automakers who need to diversify supply chains and for the federal government as it looks to boost domestic production of these minerals. Morgan Stanley estimated that 90% of the EV battery supply chain originates from China, with Chinese companies like CATL and BYD dominating the space.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act has unleashed an investment and manufacturing boom in the United States. I\u2019ve seen firsthand in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Kentucky how ecosystems have developed in communities nationwide to onshore the entire clean vehicle supply chain so the United States can lead in the field of green energy,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.\n\nThe White House also pointed out that 15 gigafactories for batteries have been commissioned in the US since the start of Biden\u2019s term in office.\n\nThe federal government, however, is giving automakers some important leeway in sourcing. \"The final regulations also identify certain impracticable-to-trace battery materials,\" the Treasury said, adding that \"qualified manufacturers may temporarily exclude these battery materials from FEOC due diligence and FEOC compliance determinations until 2027.\" This photo taken on Dec. 8, 2022, shows the graphitization process of cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries at a workshop of a company in Hegang City, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. (Photo by Xie Jianfei/Xinhua via Getty Images) (Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images)\n\nThe exemption is a boon for automakers in sourcing low-value and hard-to-trace elements like graphite, which is a critical component of a battery\u2019s anode and comes mainly from China. The automakers and their main trade group, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (AAI), cheered the 2027 exemption for non-traceable elements.\n\n\u201cThis updated guidance from the Treasury Department is something we recommended. It makes good sense for investment, job creation and consumer EV adoption,\u201d said John Bozzella, AAI president and CEO.\n\nStory continues\n\nBozzella noted that the EV tax credit was hard enough to qualify for; only 20% of EVs received the credit, and on top of that, requirements will get harder next year. A restriction on trace or low-value minerals would have meant even fewer (if not all EVs) would no longer qualify for the credit.\n\n\u201cImagine an EV that complied with all IRA eligibility requirements but is kicked out of the program because of a trace amount of a critical mineral from an FEOC. That makes no sense \u2014 especially when you consider the massive investments automakers and suppliers are making in domestic EV manufacturing,\u201d Bozzella added.\n\nRead more: Are electric cars more expensive to insure? Sen. Joe Manchin questions Education Secretary Miguel Cardona during a hearing in Washington, on Tuesday, April 30, 2024. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nCritics like Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who helped push IRA legislation through the Senate back in 2022, have been critical of its implementation ever since.\n\n\"With this final rule for the consumer credit, their creation of loopholes in the commercial vehicle credit, and their EPA tailpipe rules, the Administration is effectively endorsing 'Made in China,'\" the Democratic senator from West Virginia said in a statement, adding that the White House is \"blatantly breaking the law by implementing a bill that they did not pass.\"\n\nManchin has vowed to lead a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval for the IRA\u2019s tax credit implementation, which could lead to the repeal of Treasury\u2019s guidance for untraceable elements.\n\nThat said, even with the rules currently in place and rules at their most lenient, only 22 vehicles sold in the US qualify for the tax credit, and only 13 of them qualify for the full $7,500.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Think General Motors (GM) Is a Good Investment: Is It?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about General Motors (GM).\n\nGeneral Motors currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.83, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 23 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.83 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 23 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.9% and 4.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GM Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for GM\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for General Motors here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying General Motors, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs GM a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for General Motors, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.9% over the past month to $9.38.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for General Motors. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for General Motors may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "With the market digesting all the tough news around us, it may be time to consider auto stocks to buy once the red ink subsides. It\u2019s a speculative venture to be sure yet fortune favors the bold.\n\nFundamentally, automakers represent the economic rubber meeting the road, literally and figuratively. Yes, many components of the vehicle industry are discretionary; that is, people don\u2019t need to buy a European luxury car with all the trimmings. Take such examples aside, though, and the reality is that personal transportation is a necessity.\n\nIn parts of the nation where public transportation is limited, not having your own car is a significant disadvantage. With that, these are the auto stocks to buy should the market incur a correction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to legacy automakers pivoting to electric vehicles, General Motors (NYSE:GM) may be one of the most credible. Sure, right now, with the EV sector fallout, the big dogs in the automotive industry are delaying their electrification plans. Instead, they\u2019re moving toward what consumers want right now \u2013 hybrid electric vehicles.\n\nStill, once the dust settles and EVs (hopefully) resume their upward trend, General Motors will be ready. In particular, I\u2019m impressed with the company\u2019s investment in its own battery system called Ultium. It\u2019s also developed a platform to help churn out EVs that meet consumer tastes and standards.\n\nBest of all, GM can \u201celectrify\u201d its popular combustion-based brands. It\u2019s doing exactly that with the Hummer. It has many other opportunities to think about, including perhaps an all-electric Corvette one day.\n\nFurther, GM enjoys massive economies of scale. Combined with the longstanding brand awareness and power, it\u2019s a credible forward threat in the EV arena. It\u2019s definitely one of the auto stocks to buy for the long haul.\n\nToyota (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nJapanese automaker Toyota (NYSE:TM) really needs no introduction. As a company that has forged a reputation for quality and reliability, it continues to find ways to be relevant. What\u2019s notable about Toyota is that unlike its peers, it didn\u2019t go full bore into the EV race. It offered what some might call a half-hearted approach.\n\nTurns out, that was the best thing to do. As CNN reported in March this year, Toyota\u2019s hybrids have been crushing its rivals. The news agency notes that the company sold 11.2 million cars last year. That was more than any other automaker. Further, hybrids represented a third of that tally. Less than 1% were EVs.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, questions exist about whether this trend can continue. So long as infrastructural challenges in the EV ecosystem remain, I think Toyota has a winning platform on its hands. The company is giving customers what they want. And that\u2019s a convenient vehicle that has some of the efficiency attributes of plug-in EVs.\n\nShould a discount materialize, TM is one of the auto stocks to pick up.\n\nFerrari (RACE) A close-up of the Ferrari logo on a red car with drops of water\n\nSource: Konstantin Egorychev / Shutterstock.com\n\nObviously, Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) is a completely different animal compared to the other auto stocks. You\u2019re not commuting in a Ferrari; no, you\u2019re enjoying a religious experience that is accessible only to a select elite. However, because of this elitism, RACE makes for a compelling candidate for auto stocks, especially if it gets discounted.\n\nFundamentally, Ferrari should be insulated from economic woes. That\u2019s not to say that RACE stock is immune from market pressures. Clearly, that\u2019s not the case. However, Ferrari buyers aren\u2019t fretting about their 401k account or other mundane anxieties. Indeed, from my understanding, you don\u2019t actually buy a Ferrari. Instead, Ferrari buys you; that is, you must prove that you\u2019re worthy of the privilege.\n\nSuch snobbery isn\u2019t for everyone. However, this characteristic does bring resilience to the table. For instance, the company\u2019s net margin stands at just under 21%. That\u2019s better than almost 97% of the competition.\n\nOf course, you must pay for such performance. RACE stock trades at 50.25X forward earnings and this metric isn\u2019t getting cheaper on its own. So, should a correction materialize, be sure to put RACE on your radar.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nSound the alarm bell \u2014 we are about to have a post-earnings Elon Musk sighting.\n\nThe annual Milken conference, held at the Beverly Hills Hilton, is financial media's version of the Oscars. It's posh, expensive (no swag bags given to us commoners \u2014 we couldn't accept them anyway!), and crazy crowded. You never know who you will run into at the patio coffee bar. And you end up leaving more knowledgeable on something than when you came in.\n\nThis year's conference promises to be true to form.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton is on the speaking docket and will likely have a few choice words on the upcoming presidential election. Sports greats Magic Johnson and Alex Rodriguez are on panel chats, ditto investing titan Ken Griffin of Citadel.\n\nThe Yahoo Finance squad of yours truly, Akiko Fujita, and Yasmin Khorram will be there, reporting live bright and early from inside the hotel. Our coverage kicks off at 9:00 a.m. ET on Yahoo Finance, with a host of market-moving, big-name interviews.\n\nOut of all the action we'll be a part of, we are probably most intrigued by Musk's entrance to the star-studded program. The Tesla (TSLA) CEO will be speaking at 5 p.m. PT on Monday with the famed (and conference host) Michael Milken.

(FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images) (FREDERIC J. BROWN via Getty Images)\n\nMusk is a busy guy, to say the least, and isn't exactly a regular on the annual conference scene. He notoriously hates the World Economic Forum event in Davos, for example.\n\nSo I suspect he is coming armed with a couple of things to get off his chest, as he should.\n\nWhile Tesla's stock has rallied 22% since its late April earnings report on hopes related to a potential cheap EV, the news flow beyond those numbers has been terrible.\n\nThe company is in full layoff mode (despite wanting to grow with a new EV, AI, and robots...), sacking its human resources chief and its entire Supercharger department \u2014 despite the impact on partners such as General Motors (GM). The much-delayed Cybertruck has had a major recall.\n\nTesla seems more in chaos mode than ludicrous mode \u2014 and the Street generally would agree.\n\n\"We believe our concerns around earnings trajectory remain founded, based on Tesla\u2019s new pragmatic approach to new models raising difficult questions and creating considerable execution risk while leaving limited volume upside,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner said in a client note.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere's a list of items Musk needs to discuss \u2014 and be clear on \u2014 to justify the stock's rally, in this attendee's opinion. Whether he does this, who knows? The room is filled with big thinkers, and he may wax poetic on life on Mars or mean-looking robots that could delicately pet a puppy's butt.\n\nHow feasible is a profitable robotaxi launch in the next 12 months, and have you discussed this with regulators? Why are you laying people off in droves yet promising major growth with robotaxis, cheaper cars, and robots? Don't you need humans to do this? If you see yourself as an AI company, why bother making low-margin cars? Why not scrap car-making operations and license your powerful technology to other automakers to unlock software-like profit margins? How long do you plan to stay at Tesla given your other obligations? Tesla recalls have been the norm \u2014 how will you ensure product quality on a $25,000 Tesla is up to par with other cars in the price class?\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "What the Tesla Supercharger layoffs could mean for America's EV buildout",
        "content": "The latest layoffs at Tesla (TSLA) this week cut close to the bone of the EV pioneer\u2019s big competitive advantage \u2014 its ubiquitous Supercharger network.\n\nAs first reported by EV blog Electrek, Tesla laid off nearly the entire Supercharger organization, which was responsible for the build-out of its best-in-class charging network. Major automakers recently signed up to use its NACS (North American Charging Standard) plug.\n\nNearly 500 workers were let go from the group, including senior director Rebecca Tinucci. CEO Elon Musk made the move last week, according to Bloomberg and other sources, and it comes after Musk spearheaded a headcount reduction that totaled over 10% earlier this month. Tesla\u2019s former head of strategic charging programs confirmed the layoffs on X as well.\n\nThe growth of Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network, totaling 6,249 Supercharger stations and more than 57,000 connectors, will now reportedly slow and construction at certain locations will cease.\n\nMusk addressed the Supercharger news on X, stating that the network will grow at \u201ca slower pace\u201d for new locations.\n\nTesla still plans to grow the Supercharger network, just at a slower pace for new locations and more focus on 100% uptime and expansion of existing locations\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 30, 2024\n\nWhat this means for the future of Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network, and the larger EV build-out across the US, is unknown and throws a lot of planning in doubt.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has put tremendous political capital into the EV transformation of the US fleet of cars on the road, including a $7.5 billion build-out of the nation\u2019s EV charging infrastructure. Through the use of public and private funding, the White House targets 500,000 new chargers by the end of the decade via the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program.\n\nTesla is one of the bigger White House partners in the NEVI initiative.\n\n\"Tesla has already been awarded money under the federal government's NEVI program; there's no way Mr. Musk would walk away from effectively free money,\u201d said CEO Andres Pinter of Bullet EV Charging, one of Tesla\u2019s Supercharger contractors, to Reuters. Pinter said Tesla\u2019s decision to pause its Supercharger buildout was a \u201ckick in the pants\u201d to his business, leaving current Tesla projects in limbo.\n\nPinter believes that the administration\u2019s \u201cfree money\u201d will likely mean Musk reconstituting the charging business, as opposed to abandoning it. And Tesla\u2019s automaker charging partners hope that is the case.\n\nStory continues US President Joe Biden speaks at the Detroit Auto Show in Michigan, on Sept. 14, 2022. (MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) (MANDEL NGAN via Getty Images)\n\nAutomakers like GM, Ford, Kia, Polestar, Stellantis, Honda, and others have signed up to access the Supercharger network, and will incorporate Tesla\u2019s NACS plug inlet in their future vehicles, under the promise that the Supercharger network would continue to grow at a steady pace.\n\n\u201cWe have nothing new to announce regarding our plans to transition to NACS [also known as the SAE J3400 standard],\u201d GM said in a statement to Yahoo Finance concerning Tesla\u2019s latest move. \u201cWe are continuing to monitor the situation regarding changes to the Supercharger team and the potential impacts.\u201d\n\nFord, which earlier this year received access to the Supercharger via the use of a Tesla-made adapter, said its \u201cplans for our customers do not change\u201d at the moment. Rivian, which also gained access to the Supercharger network this year, told Yahoo Finance that its \u201cowners continue to have access to the Tesla Supercharger Network, and we have begun shipping NACS DC adapters to our customers.\u201d\n\nMost of the automakers who responded to Yahoo Finance echoed one another, with Kia also stating that its plans haven\u2019t changed and it will build toward NACS compatibility.\n\nThe news clearly blindsided Tesla\u2019s automaker partners, with one source at a major automaker telling Yahoo Finance the move by Tesla was \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaying off the Supercharger team is going to slow access to the network for [original equipment manufacturers] \u2026 and slow the pace of infrastructure deployment,\u201d said K.C. Boyce, vice president of mobility and energy practices at market research firm Escalent. \u201c[Supercharger layoffs] are going to put a damper on EV sales growth for Tesla and non-Tesla manufacturers.\u201d A Tesla Supercharger is seen at Willow Festival shopping plaza parking lot Wednesday, Aug. 10, 2022, in Northbrook, Ill. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nEscalent\u2019s data shows that availability and awareness of charging infrastructure impact buyers' decision to adopt EVs, and Tesla was the first car company to realize and execute on it.\n\nFurthermore, Boyce believes Musk\u2019s push into AI and robotaxis, which has been the main focus for investors since Musk's robotaxi reveal date earlier this month, may be at the expense of its successful charging network.\n\nIs the Supercharger network worth the cost?\n\nWhile some analysts believe Tesla\u2019s Supercharging business could be worth billions of dollars, others are not so sure.\n\nPeter Ramsay, a former energy analyst at Argus and BP and now editor in chief of the EV inFocus newsletter, believes Musk\u2019s move to limit spending in charging was actually a smart move.\n\nRamsay noted in a post published on Wednesday that in Tesla\u2019s Q1 earnings report, \u201cServices & Other\u201d gross profit tumbled by 40% to $81 million, and the \u201clargest material factors\u201d in the segment had nothing to do with charging, but revolved around used car sales profit and parts sales.\n\nMoreover, Ramsay cites BNEF estimates that Tesla only generated $1.74 billion last year in charging revenue, or 1.5% of total revenue. While the charging business was expected to grow in upcoming years, the business is still a \u201cfairly insignificant\u201d part of Tesla\u2019s small services division that barely makes any money, relatively speaking. Elon Musk arrives at an event in Los Angeles, April 13, 2024. (Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File) (Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)\n\n\u201cMusk\u2019s decision to reduce costs in a non-core area with ongoing high CapEx requirements and little visibility towards attractive profit margins should be seen as understandable, even if perhaps not communicated in the best way,\u201d Ramsay wrote.\n\nBNEF saw Tesla (prior to the move to axe the Supercharger team) pulling in $7.4 billion in revenue globally in its charging business by 2030. Tesla pulled in nearly $100 billion in revenue in 2023 alone.\n\nThe charging business should be able to stand up on its own, Ramsay believes, and then it may be worth something, eventually.\n\n\u201cBut our view is that charging evolving from [a] tool to help Tesla growth to something judged much more on its prospects as a business opportunity \u2014 which could well progress further to a decision around a potential sell-off of the division to a more natural owner \u2014 could be overall positive.\u201d Charging a Ford F-150 Lightning at a Tesla Supercharger location in New Jersey. (Pras Subramanian) (Pras Subramanian)\n\nTesla\u2019s move to curtail the growth of the Supercharger network also opens up pathways for other companies to step in.\n\n\u201cEVgo is actively engaged in the development of the J3400 standard as a voting member and we look forward to welcoming more Tesla drivers to our network as we add NACS to our nationwide fast charging network,\u201d said Sara Rafalson, EVgo\u2019s senior vice president of market development and public policy, to Yahoo Finance.\n\nWhile EVgo is one of the bigger players in the industry, others believe a new player could emerge and take on what Tesla started.\n\n\u201cThis unexpected move by Tesla is not indicative of a broader trend or fundamental issue with the EV charging business model. Instead, it points to an open opportunity in the industry,\u201d said Patrick Sullivan, CEO of commercial charging firm EV Realty.\n\nSullivan believes this is a moment for others to step up and lead \u201cversion 2.0\u201d of the charging industry, as it moves toward open standards and interoperability. Those 500 or so laid off from Tesla have valuable expertise, he said.\n\n\u201cTesla alumni are already everywhere, including on our own team, where they have been instrumental in helping us build low-cost, high-utilization EV charging solutions for our fleet customers,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cI have no doubt that we will see the force multiplier of this talented group of professionals once they find new roles at companies in this space.\u201d\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Growth stocks are amazing choices for investors who are willing to take a little bit of added risk in the hopes that an innovative company will achieve above-average growth in revenue and earnings. But equally important is to identify growth stocks to sell should the ones in your portfolio aren\u2019t pulling their weight.\n\nGrowth stocks are popular because they are expanding fast \u2014 at least, the good ones are \u2014 and plugging their profits into growing their businesses even more. That\u2019s why many growth stocks don\u2019t offer dividends or buy back stock, because they are too busy scaling their businesses or expanding via mergers and acquisitions.\n\nGrowth stocks are also often out of whack with their fundamentals \u2014 and that\u2019s something to consider. It\u2019s not entirely unusual to see a growth stock with a high price-to-sales ratio or a price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe other side of the coin to growth stocks are value stocks, which typically are solid, consistent performers that trade at a lower price relative to their fundamentals, and often reward shareholders with dividends or stock buybacks.\n\nIf you\u2019re holding a growth stock that isn\u2019t growing as much as it should, then you\u2019ve probably got a growth stock to sell on your hands.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader can be an ideal tool to help you identify the underperformers as it evaluates stocks based on growth, earnings performance, momentum and other factors.\n\nToday we\u2019ll look at some growth stocks to sell. Some of them have strong grades in the Portfolio Grader for growth \u2014 but all of them are underperformers with an overall disappointing grade. Those are the ones that you want be the most cautious with when considering what kind of growth stocks you want to have in your holdings.\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) AMC theater in Manhattan, New York City. AMC stock. APE stock\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to really consider AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) a growth stock, but if it is, it\u2019s certainly among the growth stocks to sell. It\u2019s more of a meme stock to me because it was one of those that gained in popularity when retail investors decided to jump into it, GameStop (NYSE:GME) and a few others.\n\nOn top of that, this is a growth stock that\u2019s not growing. While revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion, up from $990 million, AMC could not hold on to that momentum.\n\nPreliminary Q1 figures show that AMC plans to post revenue of $951.4 million, a drop from $954.4 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAMC is also expected to post a loss of $163.5 million and 62 cents per share, versus a loss of $235.5 million and $1.71 per share a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMC has a debt problem of $4.6 billion that continues to weigh on the company. Some lenders are seeking an extension on that debt payment, but that\u2019s not enough to make me change my mind about AMC stock.\n\nAMC stock is down 51% in 2024. It gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth but an \u201cF\u201d rating overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMagna International (MGA) A Magna International (MGA) sign is on the front of a Magna building in Ontario, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMagna International (NYSE:MGA) can do it all with automobiles. The Canadian company can do bodywork, power train modules, electrical systems and interiors. It can even manufacture complete vehicles.\n\nThe company has a partnership with General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Wipro (NYSE:WIT) to develop a business-to-business platform called SDVerse that would serve as a matchmaking platform for buyers and sellers of embedded automotive software.\n\nBut then there\u2019s the downside. Magna also has a relationship with Fisker (OTCMKTS:FSRN), a struggling electric vehicle company that is just trying to stay out of bankruptcy at this point.\n\nEvercore ISI downgraded MGA stock specifically because of the threat that Fisker poses to Magna\u2019s bottom line.\n\nEarnings for the fourth quarter were $10.4 billion, up from $9.5 billion a year ago. An EPS of 94 cents was better than the 33 cents per share that Magna earned in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nWhile the earnings performance is OK, Fisker\u2019s threat appears to be priced in to the stock price these days. MGA stock is down 18% this year and it gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and a \u201cD\u201d overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo. Company was originally known as Research In Motion (RIM), a Canadian software company specializing in cybersecurity.. BB stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackBerry (NASDAQ:BB) made its mark as a maker of smartphones \u2014 it was one of the first devices in which you could get your email, and it was known for having a full keyboard on the device itself \u2014 which made for very small buttons.\n\nBut as other smartphone companies came along with better products that offered customer-pleasing apps and touch screen input, BlackBerry moved away from smartphones and to a software and services company.\n\nIt currently provides mobile device management, cybersecurity and software for autonomous vehicles.\n\nRevenue in the fourth quarter was $173 million, down from $175 million a year ago. The company posted loss of $56 million and 10 cents per share for the quarter, which was an improvement from its loss of $495 million and 85 cents per share from the same quarter a year ago.\n\nBB stock is down 19% this year, which is why I see it as one of the growth stocks to sell. It gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth but a \u201cD\u201d overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBoeing (BA) Royal Air Force Boeing (BA) Chinook HC2A (352) [ZH895] lifting off from runway\n\nSource: InsectWorld / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhat is there to say about Boeing (NYSE:BA)? There\u2019s not much positive to say for this blue-chip company that is having a horrendous year.\n\nThe maker of the Boeing 737 Max 9 passenger jet is under tremendous pressure ever since the rear door flue off a jet while in midflight.\n\nFederal investigators grounded the entire fleet for inspection and two airlines reported finding loose screws on their aircraft.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have both been critical of Boeing, and with good reason.\n\nSeveral online tools have popped up in response, showing passengers how to avoid getting on 737 Max when booking their flights.\n\nNone of this is publicity that will help Boeing or BA stock. Boeing is one of the worst performers this year in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nThe stock is down 32% this year and earns a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and a \u201cD\u201d overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square (SQ) logo displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) is a technology computer software company. Besides owning the hardware that allows people to process credit card transactions from a smartphone or tablet.\n\nBlock also operates the CashApp finance platform, which is used as an alternative to traditional banks.\n\nIn addition, Block has a significant investment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD), owning over 8,000 of the digital currency.\n\nAs the price of Bitcoin jumped 69% in 2024, Block realized $207 million in earnings from its Bitcoin holdings in the fourth quarter of 2023. That\u2019s a huge percentage of the company\u2019s overall $562 million in quarterly revenue.\n\nSo yes, Block is making money. But I\u2019m also concerned that it\u2019s overly reliant on the Bitcoin price to do so. Bitcoin is down 10% in the last month and that doesn\u2019t bode well for SQ earnings when it next reports.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rise was the only reason Block registered a profit for the 2023 fiscal year. It needs to find another way to profit should Bitcoin continue to slide in 2024.\n\nSQ stock is down 11% in 2024.

This is a prime example of why it\u2019s important to review your portfolio regularly.\n\nMercadoLibre operates an e-commerce and digital marketplace. Not only does it handle over 21% of all e-commerce sales in Latin America, but it serves as a payment processor for people who don\u2019t want to use a traditional bank.\n\nHowever, MELI looks like it\u2019s turning things around. First-quarter earnings reported May 2 showed net revenues up 36% from a year ago, and net income up 90%.\n\nMELI stock is down 6% in 2024, though that may be changing as the stock is up 3.6% in after-hours trading after reporting earnings on Thursday afternoon. It gets an \u201cA\u201d rating for growth but a \u201cD\u201d overall grade in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nLamb Weston (LV) Louis Vuitton storefront featuring an LV handbag.

        "title": "Down 57% from Highs, Is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Stock a Buy Now?",
        "content": "While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has generated game-changing wealth for long-term shareholders, it has trailed the broader markets by a wide margin in the last two years. Tesla stock has returned a whopping 10,790% to investors since its IPO in July 2010. However, shares of the world\u2019s leading electric vehicle manufacturer are currently down 57% from all-time highs, and now could be a good time to buy the dip.\n\nI am bullish on Tesla due to its strong market positioning, widening portfolio of vehicles, and the worldwide transition toward battery-powered vehicles. Let\u2019s dive deeper.\n\nWhy Has Tesla Stock Soared Recently?\n\nTesla stock is up over 24% since it reported Q1 results last week. In Q1 of 2024, Tesla reported revenue of $21.3 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.45 per share. Comparatively, Wall Street expected revenue of $22.2 billion and earnings of $0.49 per share. Despite the revenue and earnings miss, Tesla stock surged over 12% in a single trading session after the company disclosed plans to begin producing cheaper EV vehicles within the next 12 months.\n\nEarlier this week, Tesla stock popped 15.3% after the company stated it is positioned to launch its FSD (full self-driving) technology at scale in China. According to several reports, Tesla CEO Elon Musk visited China over the weekend and discussed data security measures with industry regulators.\n\nSoon after the meeting, China paved the way for Tesla to launch its FSD software in the country. Due to data security concerns, Tesla\u2019s FSD tech was previously deployed with certain restrictions in China.\n\nTesla Is Part of an Expanding Market\n\nAccording to a report from Fortune Business Insights, the global electric vehicle market is forecast to expand from $385 billion in 2022 to $1.58 trillion in 2030, indicating an annual growth rate of almost 18%. An expanding addressable market provides Tesla with enough room to grow its top line while entering new growth markets such as Asia.\n\nTesla is the largest EV manufacturer in the U.S. and has a 6.7% share in China, the world\u2019s biggest EV market. Last week, Tesla explained that it plans to use existing capabilities to build affordable cars and raise vehicle production by 50% from 2023. The company\u2019s current manufacturing capacity is around three million vehicles. So, Tesla is likely to hit peak production capacity at existing facilities before investing in new factories.\n\nHowever, it still increased capital expenditures by 34% to $2.77 billion in Q1 of 2024. The company emphasized that it is investing in growth verticals, including building out its AI infrastructure, production capacity, and service networks. To offset these costs and improve operational efficiency, Tesla recently undertook a cost-cutting exercise and laid off 10% of its workforce.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn its quarterly shareholder deck, Tesla stated, \u201cThe future is not only electric, but also autonomous. We believe scaled autonomy is only possible with data from millions of vehicles and an immense AI training cluster. We have, and continue to expand, both.\u201d\n\nA Low-Cost Vehicle Will be a Key Growth Driver\n\nTesla needs to find a way to increase vehicle production, revenue, and earnings, all of which should boost its market cap, going forward. The EV market is bound to attract additional players, resulting in a competitive marketplace. However, Tesla benefits from a first-mover advantage and a strong brand presence.\n\nThere are two more reasons for Tesla to gain momentum in the upcoming decade. First, it would need to launch new models across price points to target growth in emerging economies such as India and Latin America. The exclusive car company is now eying mass market production and very well be a household name in the next 10 years.\n\nSecond, Tesla might unlock another multi-billion-dollar revenue stream if the company can successfully showcase its FSD capabilities later this year. Investors should note that Tesla\u2019s FSD software right now is an upgrade on its Autopilot Software, which was launched in 2020. So, Tesla\u2019s cars are not fully autonomous and are equipped with features such as auto parking and other \u201clevel 2\u201d driver-assistant capabilities.\n\nMusk has long promised the launch of fully autonomous vehicles but has failed to deliver on these lofty goals, until now. Earlier this month, Musk announced that the robotaxi launch is scheduled for August 8.\n\nIf Tesla can successfully launch a fully autonomous robotaxi, it can enter the ride-hailing market to compete with incumbents such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT). For context, in the last 12 months, Uber has reported revenue of $37 billion.\n\nTesla Needs to Tide Over Headwinds\n\nTesla\u2019s top line narrowed by 9% year-over-year in Q1, its largest drop in more than a decade. Further, Tesla reported an 8.5% decline in vehicle deliveries for the March quarter.\n\nIn the last two years, Tesla has been wrestling with rising interest rates, inflation, and a sluggish macro environment, which has reduced demand for EVs. In fact, several legacy auto manufacturers, such as Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM), scaled back EV production in 2024 due to lower-than-expected demand. Additionally, Tesla is facing rising competition from China-based manufacturers, including Byd (OTC:BYDDF) and NIO (NYSE:NIO).\n\nTo counter these headwinds, Tesla has reduced vehicle prices several times in the last 12 months, hoping to boost demand. However, these price cuts have lowered the EV giant\u2019s profit margins, as gross profits were down 18% year-over-year while net income slumped 55% to $1.1 billion in Q1.\n\nTo regain investor confidence, Tesla must boost profitability and increase vehicle shipments, both of which seem difficult in the near term.\n\nIs TSLA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOut of the 35 analyst ratings given to TSLA stock, seven are Buys, 16 are Holds, and nine are Sells, indicating a Hold consensus rating. The average TSLA stock price target is $171.99, indicating downside potential of 5% from current levels.\n\nWall Street expects Tesla to report adjusted earnings of $2.58 per share with revenue of $100.4 billion in 2024. So, TSLA stock is priced at 70x forward earnings, which is quite steep given that the sector median is 14.8x.\n\nThat said, growth stocks trade at a premium, and Tesla is forecast to expand its earnings by roughly 40% to $3.61 per share in 2025.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nTesla is a beaten-down growth stock that is trading well off its high. I believe the pullback in share prices provides long-term shareholders with an opportunity to buy the dip and benefit from outsized gains when market sentiment improves.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Ford's April sales dip, but hybrid shipments surge",
        "content": "Ford (F) reported April US sales that dipped slightly, but saw continued strength with hybrid and truck sales, highlighting the automaker\u2019s pivot into those vehicles.\n\nFor the month, Ford sold 178,588 vehicles, down 2.4% compared to last year, though there was one less selling day this April. However, Ford sales are still up 4.2% for the year. Ford\u2019s hybrid sales jumped 60% compared to a year ago to nearly 18K units, powered by big shipments of the Maverick pickup and the all-new F-150 hybrid.\n\n\u201cSales of the new F-150 hybrid set a new monthly sales record \u2014 up 93.6% \u2014 making F-150 hybrid America\u2019s No. 1 selling full-size hybrid pickup for the month,\u201d said Jim Baumbick, Ford vice president of product development, operations, and quality, to Yahoo Finance. Ford shares were up 2% in midday trade following April's results.\n\nThe F-150 hybrid sales, along with sales of the hybrid Maverick pickup, powered Ford to another hybrid sales record in April. Maverick hybrid pickup sales jumped 63.5% to 6,401 trucks, and year-to-date overall Maverick sales have hit 26,061 trucks \u2014 up 73.2%. \u201cMaverick is bringing new customers into the Ford brand with a conquest rate of 59% last year, with the majority of buyers coming from the small utility segment,\u201c Baumbick said. The 2024 Ford F-150 truck is displayed at the Dearborn Truck Plant, Thursday, April 11, 2024, in Dearborn, Mich. (Carlos Osorio/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nFord says hybrid momentum is likely to keep up.\n\n\u201cWe expect this growth in hybrids to continue. Over the current five-year business plan period, US hybrid sales are expected to more than quadruple,\u201d Baumbick said. \u201cWe plan to offer hybrid choices across 80% of our US lineup in four years.\u201d\n\nBaumbick notes its hybrid customers don\u2019t have to change their vehicle usage behavior like they would with EVs, plus hybrids still offer good gas mileage.\n\nFord\u2019s full EV sales are still climbing too. EV sales were up nearly 130% in April, to just over 8K units. Mustang Mach-E (up 205%) and F-150 Lightning (up 57%) are still seeing sales growth, however Ford has had to increase incentives to move the vehicles off dealer lots.\n\nA down note for Ford: its SUV sales, in particular its Bronco Sport, Bruno, and Escape crossover. A Ford representative noted that Explorer sales (which were up in the month) were affected by a dealer sell-down to clear out inventory but should improve, and a new full-size Expedition on the way will boost SUV sales.\n\nAs for its cash cow truck business, Ford\u2019s overall truck sales were up 2% due to strong sales of the aforementioned Maverick. However, F-150 sales were down 7% as the automaker ramps up production of the all-new for 2024 pickup after sales were delayed due to a quality issue.\n\nStory continues The Ford F-150 Lightning displayed at the Philadelphia Auto Show, Friday, Jan. 27, 2023, in Philadelphia. (Matt Rourke/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nFord\u2019s April sales data comes on the heels of slight sales misses by rivals Hyundai and Kia, though Honda saw its overall US sales climb 3.2% in the month. Ford\u2019s Big Three rivals GM and Stellantis do not report monthly sales results.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "GM and Ford's Earnings Beat Could Be A Double-Edged Sword For Their EV Transformation\n\nLast week, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) topped Wall Street estimates with their first quarter results. But, they did it on the back of their internal-combustion engine vehicles, more precisely, trucks, that managed to offset EV losses. Both Ford and General Motors have responded to the EV slowdown by turning back to their traditional expertise, with Ford also focusing on hybrids. Yet, the EV revolution has not stopped, with EVs still growing, just at a slower pace. Therefore, both GM and Ford risk losing the pace as the EV evolution continues to fuel innovation.\n\nOne such example is an innovative\u00a0truck accessory maker committed to bringing\u00a0clean energy solutions\u00a0to the market, Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP).\n\nWorksport shows determination\u00a0lead the market\u00a0with\u00a0a new generation of\u00a0revolutionary\u00a0accessories.\n\nWorksport just announced a monumental partnership with\u00a0Chief of Chaos,the masterminds behind the explosive growth of global leaders\u00a0like Uber\u00a0Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER) and many others. With Chief of Chaos\u2019 expertise, Worksport will be able to plot\u00a0explosive growth for\u00a0its\u00a0innovative product lines.\u00a0This collaboration is set to propel Worksport\u00a0and its groundbreaking intellectual property\u00a0into the spotlight.\u00a0Worksport\u2019s nano-grid, consisting of theSOLIS solar-powered tonneau cover and COR portable battery system, are\u00a0being eagerly anticipated\u00a0by the marketwith first units of the SOLIS scheduled to arrive this summer. Moreover, Worksport awoke\u00a0ongoing OEM interest from global automakers like Hyundai\u00a0\u00a0Motor Company with its power duo.\u00a0Along with Hyundai, the SOLIS will also be available for the dimensions of major brand trucks, including those of\u00a0Ford Motor and General Motors.\u00a0With SOLIS and COR, Worksport\u00a0is anticipated to tap into a\u00a0market potential that exceeds $3 billion in annual revenue.\n\nGoing back to ICEs can't help Ford and GM much to reach an all-electric destination.\n\nAmidst industry challenges, Ford\u2019s EV division is facing mounting losses. During the first three months of the year, Ford lost $132,000 on each EV unit. Ford kicked off the year with first quarter\u2019s EV loss amounting to$1.3\u00a0billion.\u00a0The EV transition is undoubtedly not without\u00a0its complexities and uncertainties, along with an increasingly competitive environment, but it\u2019s hardly likely that going back to internal combustion engines will help GM and Ford reach their destination as they need to find a way to stay relevant and make it in the all-electric future.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Detroit\u2019s comeback is nothing short of a miracle. As a city, it was dead and buried as recently as 2013, when it declared bankruptcy with more than $18 billion in debt. It has come a long way since those dark days.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect \u2014 no city is. However, it\u2019s attracting attention from various places, including the NFL, which held its annual draft in Detroit from April 25 to April 27. Approximately 270,000 people attended the first day \u2014 not too shabby.\n\nI grew up in Toronto, a three-hour drive down the 401 from Detroit. It\u2019s nice to see how far it has come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA recent Fortune article covered the Property Brothers \u2014 Canadians Drew and Jonathan Scott \u2014 discussing real estate investing on CNBC. It highlighted the progress made by the once-down-and-out auto town.\n\n\u201cDetroit is like that on a national level. There\u2019s so much money pouring in, so much redevelopment happening. I bet you in 20 years, it\u2019s going to be one of the most technically advanced cities,\u201d Jonathan told CNBC.\n\nDetroit is happening. Here are three ways to play its comeback.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn April 15, General Motors (NYSE:GM) announced that it was moving its Detroit headquarters in 2025 to Hudson\u2019s Detroit, a new development on the former location of the J.L. Hudson Department Store, one of North America\u2019s finest retail establishments in its day.\n\n\u201cThe move to Hudson\u2019s Detroit will mark GM\u2019s return to Woodward Avenue, where it established its first headquarters in the city. GM has now entered into an initial 15-year, multi-level lease for the top office floors of the state-of-the-art office building as well as showcase space on the street level for GM vehicles and community activations,\u201d stated its April 15 press release.\n\nIt\u2019s a good decision by CEO Mary Barra. She\u2019s on a bit of a roll in 2024.\n\nOn April 23, it reported strong Q1 2024 results, including a 7.6% increase in sales and $2.62 in earnings per share, $1.1 billion and 47 cents higher than analyst estimates. Further, it raised its adjusted pre-tax profits for 2024 to $13.5 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, up from $13.0 billion.\n\nGraham Holdings (GHC) Radio microphone in a soundproofed room with an \"on air\" sign in the background.\n\nSource: radioshoot/ShutterStock.com\n\nIn October 2013, the Graham family sold The Washington Post and its other publishing businesses to Jeff Bezos for $250 million.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 May 2, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are General Motors Co. GM, JD.com JD, StoneCo STNE, Affiliated Managers Group AMG and PagSeguro Digital PAGS.\n\n5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Add to Your Kitty in May\n\nIt\u2019s not an easy job to find value stocks. Being aware of a company's key financial numbers, like earnings per share and sales growth, can help investors identify stocks that are trading for less than what they are worth. However, a proper analysis of the fundamentals with the help of a number of metrics is required to determine whether a stock is a good bargain or not.\n\nFor narrowing down the list of undervalued stocks, price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) are the first ratios that come to an investor\u2019s mind. However, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), though underrated, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.\n\nThe P/B ratio is calculated as below:\n\nP/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity\n\nThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Co., JD.com, StoneCo, Affiliated Managers Group and PagSeguro Digital are some such stocks.\n\nNow, let us understand the concept of book value.\n\nWhat's Book Value?\n\nThere are several ways by which book value can be defined. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company\u2019s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.\n\nIt is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders\u2019 equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company\u2019s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.\n\nUnderstanding P/B Ratio\n\nBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.\n\nA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.\n\nFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock\u2019s price may be significantly high \u2014 thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one \u2014 in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.\n\nMoreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.\n\nIn any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.\n\nHere are five of the nine picks that qualified the screening:\n\nHeadquartered in Detroit, General Motors is one of the world\u2019s largest automakers.

The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.\n\nCurrent Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\n\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\n\nValue Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.\n\nHere are five of the nine picks that qualified the screening:\n\nHeadquartered in Detroit,\u00a0General Motors is one of the world\u2019s largest automakers.

        "title": "A General Motors Stock Comeback? A Contrarian Play for Savvy Investors.",
        "content": "After General Motors (NYSE:GM) reported excellent first quarter results on April 23, it\u2019s clear that the automaker is benefiting from rising wages in the U.S. and its popular vehicles. Meanwhile, the stock\u2019s valuation remains very low, and it has pleased investors with its recent, shareholder-friendly moves. Finally, many Wall Street banks have turned very bullish on General Motors stock. The automaker will likely be well-prepared for the rising adoption of electric vehicles in the longer term.\n\nGiven all of these points, I recommend that value investors buy GM stock at this point.\n\nSuperb Q1 Results and a Low Valuation\n\nBy any measure, GM reported remarkable Q1 financial results on Apr. 23. Propelled by both higher revenue and cost cutting, the firm\u2019s earnings per share advanced to $2.62 versus $2.21 in Q1 of 2023. Moreover, analysts, on average, had expected its Q1 EPS to come in at only $2.11. Meanwhile, GM\u2019s top line climbed 7.5% year-over-year to $43 billion. The latter figure was $1.22 billion higher than analysts\u2019 mean projection going into the print. And GM even increased its 2024 EPS guidance to $9 to $10 from its previous outlook of $8.50 to $9.50.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors stock has advanced about 5% since the firm its Q1 results, but the shares still have an extremely low forward price-earnings ratio of 5. Moreover, its price-sales ratio of 0.34 is truly tiny.\n\nShareholder-Friendly Moves and Upbeat Notes From Multiple Banks\n\nIn November, GM disclosed that it would increase its dividend by 33% to 12 cents per quarter and buy back $10 billion of stock. The automaker ultimately followed through on the dividend increase.\n\nIn the wake of GM\u2019s Q1 results, Swiss bank UBS increased its price target on the shares to $58. Among the reasons for the increase were positive changes to analysts\u2019 earnings estimates in the wake of GM\u2019s Q1 results and the firm\u2019s Q1 performance itself. Japanese bank Mizuho, meanwhile, increased its target to $52 from $48, citing the automaker\u2019s high sales of gasoline-powered trucks and SUVs, along with its reduced spending on the development of EVs. Finally, Wedbush increased its price target to $55, based partly on the company guidance increase and the firm\u2019s ability to benefit from macro trends. All three banks kept \u201cbuy\u201d ratings on the shares.\n\nGM Is Well Positioned in EVs\n\nThere\u2019s a great deal of doubt now about whether the EV Revolution will progress. But I think it\u2019s clear that economics, with nudges from governments and technological improvements, will ultimately enable EVs to constitute 30% or more of sales in most countries, including the U.S., by the end of the decade. Electricity is simply much cheaper to produce than oil. Most electricity producers\u2019 ability to hike prices is limited because they are tightly regulated. What\u2019s more, electricity prices don\u2019t quickly soar because of the actions of foreign countries and Wall Street speculators. As a result of these points, charging EVs will always, on the whole, be meaningfully cheaper than pumping gas into conventional vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd many countries and companies will install EV chargers, while battery ranges will increase as their charging times fall. Finally, governments will continue pushing automakers to sell EVs and incentivizing consumers to buy them. Due to all of these developments, the adoption of EVs will soar in the long term.\n\nAt a time when many other companies are scrambling to start creating a low-cost EV, GM already has its Chevy Bolt. Previously one of the most popular EVs in the U.S., the Bolt is on hiatus. However, it is scheduled to be brought back next year. And GM\u2019s Cadillac Lyriq is becoming a popular electric SUV, as GM delivered 5,800 Lyriqs to consumers last quarter. GM is also offering several electric trucks and large SUVs, including the Blazer, the Hummer, its BrightDrop delivery van, the Equinox, and the Silverado.\n\nFinally, GM reported that its newer, Ultium EVs will generate a \u201cpositive variable profit\u201d by the end of this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "Jeep, Ram parent Stellantis slides 10% as concern grows over 'bloated' inventory",
        "content": "Stellantis (STLA) stock slid on Tuesday as the company reported first quarter sales and shipments that fell compared to a year ago, just as a slew of new vehicles are poised to hit showroom floors later this year.\n\nThe Big Three automaker \u2014 which has a more European-focused product portfolio compared to rivals like GM and Ford \u2014 reported revenue of $44.54 billion, down 12% compared to a year ago.\n\nOn the conference call, CFO Natalie Knight said this was \u201cdue to transitions in product offering, inventory management, regional mix, and F/X impact.\u201d Shipments also fell 10%, to 1.335 million globally, as the Ram, Jeep, and Fiat-parent said low inventories and supply kept deliveries down, but the company did say new products that will replace discontinued models leading to a boost Q2 shipments and inventories.\n\nStellantis does not provide financial results for Q1 and Q3, only giving investors first-half and full-year results. Though the automaker confirmed its full-year 2024 guidance of double-digit adjusted operating income (AOI) for the year with Knight claiming it will be in the low teens, Stellantis shares tumbled 10% in midday trade and are up 3% for the year.\n\nCleary investors and analysts were not assuaged by the fact that Stellantis sees Q2 shipments improving compared to Q1, revenue rising, and industrial free cash flow stronger in the back half of the year versus the first half. Stellantis also said lower shipments in Q1 were a good thing, which reflects a \u201cnon-repeat of [the] Q1 \u201823 inventory build.\u201d\n\nBut with 25 new models on the way, there is worry that inventories could build back up and lead to discounting that will eventually hurt its margins.\n\n\u201cConcern over STLA\u2019s bloated inventory levels is one of the primary reasons why we lowered our rating to Hold last month,\u201d CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said to Yahoo Finance. \u201cIn its key market of North America, STLA\u2019s brands of Jeep, Dodge, Ram, Fiat, and Alfa Romeo all have among the highest inventory levels of any OEM brand.\u201d Nelson lowered his price target on the stock to $24 from $30 after the Q1 release. The Ram 1500 REV full EV pickup (credit: Stellantis) (Ram)\n\nNelson also points to an earlier analysis in which the CFRA team sees Stellantis as an automaker that might have to boost \u201cincentives further and take other measures to better align supply with demand.\u201d\n\nOn the pricing front, Knight did say Stellantis was \u201cable to take our MSRPs down and incentives down, so we saw net pricing that was very, very stable\u201d in the quarter, and believes the new products will drive \u201cexcitement\u201d and sales in the 2nd half of the year. And the company is having success with its PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) sales, which were up nearly 80% in the quarter, with full EV sales up 8%, though on low volume.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors will be looking to see if new product offerings, including EV and hybrid range-extending versions of its popular Ram pickups, do indeed boost Stellantis\u2019 fortunes later this year.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why General Motors Company (GM) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "General Motors Company (GM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +1.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors falls in, has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nGeneral Motors is expected to post earnings of $2.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +34.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +16.2%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.38 points to a change of +22.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +4.9%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.57 indicates a change of +2% from what General Motors is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.9%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor General Motors, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $44.36 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $174.62 billion and $175.41 billion estimates indicate +1.6% and +0.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGeneral Motors reported revenues of $43.01 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.6%. EPS of $2.62 for the same period compares with $2.21 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.29 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.18%. The EPS surprise was +25.96%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGeneral Motors is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Stellantis Stock Still Stands to Stump the Skeptics",
        "content": "Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) has been a victorious underdog. Formed when Fiat Chrysler merged with Peugeot in 2021, its formation represented the union of several \u201calso-ran\u201d contenders in the automotive space. However, Stellantis stock has proven its critics wrong, and in a big way.\n\nSince the deal close, shares in this Dutch-domiciled entity, whose main vehicle brands in the U.S. are Jeep, Ram, and Dodge, have performed well. At one point, shares were up 100% from where they were when the megamerger closed. Yes, strong post-pandemic vehicle demand played a role in this, but that\u2019s been the only factor.\n\nStellantis\u2019 focus on the bottom line and on growth has played a role as well. This bodes well for the future, both for the company riding out possible rocky conditions in the near-term and for continuing to be a winner among automotive stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStellantis Stock: A Banner Year in 2023, but is Trouble Ahead?\n\nSTLA has performed strongly over a multiyear time frame, but the bulk of these gains took shape in 2023. Interestingly enough, last year was not a banner one for this automaker\u2019s total sales. In fact, while rivals reported increased volumes in 2023, Stellantis reported both lower volumes and lower market share.\n\nHowever, one can say that the company more than made up for it, based on its latest full-year fiscal results. In 2023, sales went up 6%, with net earnings going up by 11%.\n\nThis continued strong fiscal performance, coupled with further news on the company\u2019s EV endeavors, has led to an outsized move higher for STLA.\n\nOver the past year, shares have rallied more than 53.5%. However, STLA has pulled back, due to some less-than-stellar news. For Q1 2024, the company reported continued volume declines, especially for its Ram and Dodge brands. At first glance, this may seem like a sign of trouble emerging.\n\nAfter all, cost cutting and focusing on pricier vehicle models can only go so far. Still, even if Q1 fiscal results reveal lower revenue and earnings as well, don\u2019t assume that means the end of the road for STLA.\n\nWhy Downside Risk May be Minimal\n\nWith its high double-digit move higher over the past twelve months, STLA has outperformed its incumbent auto stock peers, in particular \u201cDetroit Three\u201d rivals like Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).\n\nGiven both Stellantis\u2019 weak Q1 vehicle volume numbers, plus downbeat forecasts for 2024 new car demand, the skeptics may expect an outsized decline for this stock relative to peers.\n\nHowever, downside risk for STLA from this industry rough patch may be smaller than the bears anticipate. Namely, because an industry downturn may be also baked into the stock\u2019s valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt current prices, Stellantis trades for four times forward earnings. For comparison, GM trades for nearly five times earnings, and Ford trades for over six times earnings. Not only that, the STLA forward multiple is based on sell-side consensus, which already calls for earnings to fall compared to 2023, from $6.56 to $6.18 per share.\n\nGiven management\u2019s cost discipline, additional sales declines may not necessarily lead to a big earnings drop. Analysts like Piper Sandler\u2019s Alexander Potter remain bullish that the company\u2019s above-average margins will persist. Although consensus also calls for STLA\u2019s earnings to drop again in 2025, it\u2019s not set in stone this happens.\n\nBottom Line: Still a Strong Choice for Value, Yield, and Growth\n\nLater this year, sales trends for Stellantis could improve. That\u2019s when the company releases its much-anticipated Jeep Wagoneer S electric SUV. The automaker is also gearing up for the launch of a new gas-powered vehicle model, the Ram 1500 RHO. Success with this vehicle could also help shore up results a few quarters from now.\n\nConsidering these vehicle launches, plus Stellantis\u2019 further pivot toward EVs, the automaker may stay a winner in 2025 and beyond.\n\nHence, alongside good value, STLA also offers growth potential. Keep in mind, too, that this is also a high-yield stock. Shares sport a forward yield of 6.67% at current prices.\n\nShares could soon sink, following the release of fiscal results on today. However, a post-earnings decline for Stellantis stock may prove short-lived. Consider this a great choice among auto stocks, even in the face of potential weakness.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "General Motors Company (GM) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of General Motors Company (GM)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 1.1% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $46.17 in the previous session. General Motors Company has gained 27.6% since the start of the year compared to the -13.8% move for the Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector and the -25.9% return for the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 23, 2024, General Motors reported EPS of $2.62 versus consensus estimate of $2.08 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4.18%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, General Motors is expected to post earnings of $9.32 per share on $174.62 billion in revenues. This represents a 21.35% change in EPS on a 1.62% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $9.46 per share on $175.41 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 1.52% and 0.45%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nGeneral Motors may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nGeneral Motors has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 4.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 13.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 2.4X versus its peer group's average of 6.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.55. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, General Motors currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if General Motors fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though General Motors shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Value Stocks to Buy on the Dip: April 2024",
        "content": "Outside of recent rumblings, the sentiment surge in the equities space this year has taken some of the shine off value stocks to buy on the dip. It\u2019s not that the concept lost relevance or popularity. Rather, they\u2019re just difficult to find amid the market euphoria.\n\nStill, with the shakeup occurring in the technology sector, the red ink might represent an opportunity to reexamine the aforementioned approach. There are several compelling enterprises that just didn\u2019t get the spotlight. That might be changing soon. Below are three risky but attractive value stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile it\u2019s a risky idea, legacy automotive giant General Motors (NYSE:GM) presents an enticing case for value stocks to buy on the dip. Let\u2019s get the main stats out of the way. Currently, GM trades at only 4.83X forward earnings. That\u2019s well below the sector median of 11.79X. In addition, shares are also priced at 0.34X trailing-year revenue, below the sector median 0.84X.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat\u2019s weird is that GM is a strong performer in the charts. Since the start of the year, shares gained almost 27% of equity value. However, given the cheap multiples, it\u2019s possible that GM could swing up. Personally, I\u2019m almost certain of it because of the fundamental context.\n\nThroughout the past several months, electric vehicles have struggled. They suffer from the double whammy of being higher priced compared to combustion cars and must also contend with the inflation and high-interest-rate headwinds.\n\nOn the other hand, combustion-based hybrid vehicles have soared in sales. GM is making the pivot, bringing back its plug-in hybrids. The move should pay off, making it one of the value stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nSibanye Stillwater (SBSW) Person holding smartphone with logo of South African mining company Sibanye Stillwater Limited on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo be upfront, precious metals mining firm Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) is risky. Even if you add the context of value stocks to buy on the dip, it still presents significant challenges. Since the start of the year, the South Africa-based miner lost almost 9% of equity value. But that\u2019s not the worst of it. No, in the past 52 weeks, SBSW stock suffered a decline of more than 44%.\n\nThat\u2019s frustrating because \u2013 outside of recent choppiness \u2013 the gold market has been swinging higher. Concerns about sticky inflation along with geopolitical flashpoints have accelerated the fear trade. Therefore, safe-haven assets like gold have become much more prominent. That\u2019s the baseline argument for SBSW stock. Given that shares are already so undervalued \u2013 trading at only 4.49X trailing-year earnings, for instance \u2013 SBSW could have a big upside pathway.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, Sibanye is a major producer of palladium. Now, palladium is a critical industrial metal used often in catalytic converters. With hybrid vehicle sales rising, more palladium may be required. Therefore, SBSW should be on your radar for value stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nCVS Health (CVS) the storefront of a CVS pharmacy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA specialist in the broader healthcare plans segment, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is best known for its retail pharmacy business. It also offers a healthcare benefits segment, providing traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services. Currently, CVS stock appears grossly undervalued, trading at only 8.12X forward earnings. However, the criticism is that CVS might justifiably be trading at a cheap multiple.\n\nFor one thing, analysts on average are expecting fiscal 2024 earnings per share to reach $8.30. That\u2019s disappointing compared to last year\u2019s print of $8.74. Not only that, the most optimistic target calls for EPS of only $8.40. On the revenue front, experts are only projecting 3.6% growth to $370.82 billion. Still, CVS could be a legitimate contender for value stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the near-17% loss on a year-to-date basis. Rather, CVS should be able to weather the competitive storm. Yes, other enterprises are encroaching into its lane. However, CVS enjoys a powerful brand presence. Plus, with a massive physical footprint, it\u2019s just more convenient.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "General Motors (NYSE:GM) Has Announced A Dividend Of $0.12",
        "content": "General Motors Company's (NYSE:GM) investors are due to receive a payment of $0.12 per share on 20th of June. Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 1.0%.\n\nWhile the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that General Motors' stock price has increased by 30% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for General Motors\n\nGeneral Motors' Dividend Is Well Covered By Earnings\n\nWhile yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. However, General Motors' earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 13.7% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 3.5%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend. historic-dividend\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.20 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.48. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 8.8% per year. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.\n\nWe Could See General Motors' Dividend Growing\n\nGiven that dividend payments have been shrinking like a glacier in a warming world, we need to check if there are some bright spots on the horizon. We are encouraged to see that General Motors has grown earnings per share at 7.9% per year over the past five years. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.\n\nOur Thoughts On General Motors' Dividend\n\nOverall, this is a reasonable dividend, and it being raised is an added bonus. While the payout ratios are a good sign, we are less enthusiastic about the company's dividend record. The dividend looks okay, but there have been some issues in the past, so we would be a little bit cautious.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. To that end, General Motors has 3 warning signs (and 2 which can't be ignored) we think you should know about. Is General Motors not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

        "title": "The Top 3 Transportation Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "The transportation sector literally helps to drive the U.S. economy forward. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the transportation and warehouse sector made up of planes, trains and automobiles contributed $1.7 trillion to the economy in 2022 (latest statistics available). That equates to 6.7% of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). Employment in transportation and warehousing stood at 6.7 million workers in 2022, up more than 8% from the previous year.\n\nWhether it is autoworkers, truck drivers, aircraft mechanics, or railroad engineers, transportation plays a pivotal role when it comes to employment and the economy. Within the stock market, transportation stocks are moving in the right direction. Over the past 12 months, the S&P Transportation Index has gained 7% after suffering a downturn during the pandemic and bear market of 2022. As shares move higher, now is a good time for investors to purchase. Here are the top three transportation stocks to buy in April 2024.\n\nFord Motor Co. (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord Motor Co. (NYSE:F) just reported very strong first-quarter earnings, driven by sales of its commercial vehicles. The Detroit automaker announced earnings per share (EPS) of 49 cents compared to 42 cents that was expected by analysts. The company\u2019s Q1 revenue totaled $39.89 billion versus the $40.10 billion that was forecast on Wall Street. Sales were up 3% from a year earlier. Ford\u2019s traditional business, known as Ford Blue, reported earnings of $905 million, down 66% from a year ago. However, the commercial business saw sales rise 120% year over year to $3.01 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe decline in Ford Blue was related to the launch of the company\u2019s new F-150 pick-up tuck, which faced some delays. Management said that strong commercial vehicle sales offset losses from the traditional and electric vehicle business units. Looking ahead, Ford maintained its 2024 earnings guidance, saying it expects a profit of $10 billion to $12 billion this year. The automaker reiterated that it also expects its electric vehicle business to lose $5 billion to $5.50 billion in 2024. However, Ford remains on track to take $2 billion in costs out of the business this year. F stock has risen 5% so far in 2024.\n\nGE Aerospace (GE) Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nGE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) has reported its first earnings report since hiving off its healthcare and energy businesses into separate publicly traded companies, and the results were quite good. The company, which mostly produces aircraft engines, announced Q1 EPS of 82 cents, which beat consensus estimates of 65 cents. Revenue totaled $15.2 billion, which was slightly below Wall Street estimates of $15.3 billion. The aerospace unit reported an operating profit of $1.5 billion on sales of $8.1 billion for Q1. Aerospace orders came in at $11 billion, up 34% from a year earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of guidance, GE Aerospace said that it expects a 2024 operating profit of $6.2 billion to $6.6 billion. That\u2019s up from a previous outlook of $6 billion to $6.5 billion. Beyond its earnings print, GE Aerospace also recently hiked its quarterly dividend payment to stockholders by 250%. The company now pays a quarterly dividend of 28 cents per share, up from 8 cents previously. In addition to the dividend, GE stock has also been growing, having gained 112% in the last 12 months, including a 59% increase this year.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logo\n\nSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.com\n\nDetroit automaker and Ford rival General Motors (NYSE:GM) also looks like a buy after its Q1 print. The company raised its 2024 guidance after topping Wall Street expectations with its latest earnings. GM reported earnings per share of $2.62 versus $2.15 which was expected among analysts, and revenue of $43.01 billion compared to the $41.92 billion which was estimated. The vehicle manufacturer lifted its guidance, saying it now expects earnings of $9 to $10 a share for all of this year.\n\nAnalysts and investors also liked that GM raised its forecast for free cash flow this year to a range of $8.50 billion to $10.50 billion. Strong North American sales, particularly of pick-up trucks, were largely responsible for the Q1 beat and guidance raise, said GM executives. The company also remains focused on electric vehicles with plans to produce between 200,000 and 300,000 of them this year. Boosted by the strong print and outlook, GM stock has been up by 26% year-to-date.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

These enhancements result from the company\u2019s attempts to expand its EV operations, lower material prices, and increase manufacturing efficiency.\n\nTo conclude, increasing EV profitability helps General Motors boost its competitiveness, quicken market penetration, and promote steady growth in the EV industry.\n\nStocks to Get Rich: Ford (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord (NYSE:F) has modified its capital expenditures to conform to the changing demand and environment surrounding the deployment of EVs. The business projects capital expenditures of $8 billion to $9 billion in 2024. Its focus is aligning prices with the electric vehicle industry\u2019s consumer expectations.\n\nAdditionally, Ford\u2019s electrification plan heavily emphasizes hybrid cars, and the business has seen a notable increase in the number of hybrid vehicles sold. As of Q1, Ford is the third-largest seller of hybrid vehicles in the U.S. market. Its hybrid volume growth may reach\u00a040% in 2024. Thus, Ford\u2019s expanding market share and revenue growth are\u00a0driven\u00a0by the growing demand for environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient vehicles.\u00a0This\u00a0is highlighted\u00a0by the lead of the company\u2019s hybrid products.\n\nFinally, Ford\u2019s software division has seen significant subscriber growth, with\u00a0paid customers topping 700,000 and growing by 47% annually. The increase in software subscriptions can be attributed to the increased demand from business clients for Ford\u2019s digital solutions. Therefore, the excellent subscriber retention rate and growing uptake of Ford\u2019s software solutions bolster the recurring income stream and overall profitability of Ford Pro.\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nBoeing\u2019s (NYSE:BA) backlog is a crucial predictor of future earnings and business operations. By the end of 2024\u2019s first quarter, Boeing had $529 billion in backlogs. Over 5,600 commercial aircraft, valued at $448 billion, are included in this number. Additionally, orders that Boeing has received but has not yet fulfilled are represented in the backlog, giving insight into top-line potential. For Boeing, the backlog is an important indicator of the strong demand for its products in the upcoming years.\n\nMoreover, Boeing secured 125 net orders in the first quarter of 2024, showing that it can get fresh orders. Notable contracts were among these\u00a0orders: American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) ordered 85 737-10 aircraft, and clients like Ethiopian Airlines ordered 28 777X aircraft. Hence, these orders show that Boeing can still attract clients and increase revenue for all its product categories.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast on the list of stocks to get rich is AT&T (NYSE:T). The first quarter saw robust demand for high-speed internet services, as seen in adding 252,000 AT&T Fiber net subscribers. With 17 straight quarters of net additions over 200,000, AT&T Fiber is a major growth driver in the consumer wireline market.\n\nMoreover, consumer broadband revenues increased by\u00a07.7% annually, mostly due to a robust 19.5% growth in fiber revenue. The rise highlights the growing need for high-speed internet services and reflects the potential for AT&T to leverage this trend by providing fiber services. Similarly, Fiber ARPU increased by more than 4% annually. Meanwhile, intake ARPU remained above $70.\u00a0Therefore, this\u00a0shows that fiber services are well monetized and emphasizes how\u00a0important\u00a0high-speed internet access is to customers.\n\nTo sum up, with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of\u00a02.9 times at the end of March, AT&T has been aggressively cutting its debt.\u00a0This\u00a0shows that the corporation is making headway toward attaining its goal of 2.5 times by H1 2025.\u00a0Hence, this\u00a0indicates responsible financial management and a dedication to bolstering its balance sheet.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in META, ENPH, and\u00a0T.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at\u00a0the 11 Best EV Penny Stocks to Buy. You can skip our detailed industry analysis on the EV industry and click5 Best EV Penny Stocks to Buy.\n\nRemember the time when everyone thought EVs is the future and you should pour all you have in EV stocks to get rich quick? It didn\u2019t take long for the EV euphoria to fade. With major EV stocks and ETFs like Tesla (down 31% in 2024) and iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF (down 16% so far in 2024), one might ask \u2013 what on earth happened to EV stocks and should you really invest in EV stocks for the long term?\n\nWhat's Happening in the EV Industry?\n\nRising inflation and reluctance of consumers remain major hindrances in EV sales growth. Analysts believe EVs are still on path to overtake combustion engine cars in the long term, but the growth that made EVs all the buzz in the past has clearly slowed down. Data from Motor Intelligence shows that EV sales in the US increased by 47% in 2023, clearly surpassing conventional car sales. But car dealerships are having trouble selling EV because a huge influx of new models and options as well as after-sales complaints which usually involve charging problems battery issues.\n\nA Wall Street Journal report quoted data from S&P Global Mobility which said that there are 56 EV models up for sale in 2024, with the firm expecting this number to reach 100 in 2025.\n\nEV Companies Begin Belt-Tightening Measures\n\nAmid slowing sales growth and headlines, EV companies had to slash production and cut costs. For example, Ford earlier this year decreased production of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup at its Dearborn, Michigan, factory. General Motors also postponed some production facilities for its Chevrolet Silverado EV. Tesla recently made headlines when it announced to cut 10% of its global workforce. The company talked about this development in its latest earnings call:\n\n\"We had negative free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the first quarter. The primary driver of this was an increase in inventory from a mismatch between builds and deliveries as discussed before, and our elevated spend on CapEx across various initiatives, including AI compute. We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive again. As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our head count by over 10%. The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $1 billion on an annual run rate basis. We are also getting hyper focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient manner. The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions will help improve our overall profitability and ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\nCompetition from Chinese EV Companies\n\nChinese EV companies remain the biggest problem for US EV companies like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) both in China and overseas. Not long ago US EV companies like Tesla and Volkswagen were seeing huge growth in mainland China. Local companies didn\u2019t take long to catch up. Electric vehicles made by Chinese companies now account for about half of the total EVs sold around the world. \u00a0In the fourth quarter of 2023, Chinese EV company BYD surpassed Tesla to become the top EV company in the country in terms of sales. Tesla sold 484,507 cars in the quarter, while BYD sold 526,409 fully electric vehicles. China has surpassed US, Germany, South Korea and even Japan when it comes to car exports.\n\nProfitable Growth Becoming Elusive\n\nOne of the biggest factors weighing down EV stocks is burgeoning costs. A KPMG report on the EV industry talked about a survey which shows that EV industry executives are growing less confident about their ability to achieve profitable growth over the next five years.\u00a0 Only about 34% of the surveyed executives said that they were \"extremely confident\" that they would achieve profitable growth in the next five years, compared to 41% in the previous year.\n\nThe KPMG survey shows that while executives are still hoping for growth in the EV industry, their estimates have become more realistic. For example, the report showed that about three years ago, when EV executives were asked about what market share they think EVs would take as a percentage of total car sales, the answers would be anywhere between 20% to as much as 80%. But now these estimates have fallen off the cliff amid new realities. Best EV Penny Stocks to Buy\n\nBocman1973 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhy Should You Still Invest in EV Stocks\n\nHowever, not all is doomed for the industry. The survey shows executives are still expecting growth in the EV industry.\n\n\"The mean estimates for penetration rose in the latest survey. In Western Europe, for example, respondents last year estimated that battery-electric vehicles would account for 24 percent of sales in 2030; this year the consensus estimate was 30 percent. In the US, the estimate went from 29 percent to 33 percent and in China the estimate jumped from 24 percent to 36 percent.\"\n\nGlobally, electric vehicle sales are still expected to gain in the long term. A BloombergNEF report last year said EV sales were expected to surge to 27 million in 2026. The report said that the Inflation Reduction Act means EV would account for about 28% of passenger vehicle sales by 2026, up from 7.6% in 2022. The report said that combustion engine car sales peaked in 2017 \u00a0and \"are now in long-term decline.\"\n\nIn this backdrop, we decided to see which EV penny stocks hedge funds are investing in.

        "content": "Americans\u2019 average hourly earnings rose 0.6% more than inflation between March 2023 and March 2024. Since the Consumer Price Index climbed 3.5% year-over-year (YOY) last month, we can infer that Americans\u2019 actual average wage increased 4.1% YOY in March. Since 2021, there have been similar hikes in our compensation. Many firms, including restaurant chains, advertisers, companies in the travel sector and large retail chains, have benefited from these wage hikes. Indeed, since the U.S. economy is primarily based on consumption, I believe that these compensation gains are the key reason why the nation has avoided the recession that so many were sure would be caused by the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increases. Moreover, the wage gains are also largely responsible for the stock market\u2019s attainment of new all-time highs this year. With that said, here are three stocks to buy to profit from U.S. wage growth.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nRestaurant chain Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) is clearly getting a huge boost from U.S. compensation hikes.

For example, in the fourth quarter of last year, its top line came in at $86.3 billion, up from $76 billion in Q4 of 2022., while it generated $24.9 billion of operating income, versus $18.16 billion during the same period a year earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a note to investors on April 17, Truist, a U.S. bank, predicted that GOOG would report \u201csolid\u201d Q1 results, driven by strong engagement trends which have, in turn, triggered increased ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nIn other words, consumers, flush with increased funds from wage growth ,are clicking more on Alphabet\u2019s paid ads, causing its top line to surge.\n\nTruist, which hiked its price target on GOOG stock to $170 from $158, expects the company\u2019s Q1 results to come in slightly above analysts\u2019 average estimates.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) delivered very strong Q1 results which demonstrated that it\u2019s been a major beneficiary of Americans\u2019 wage growth.\n\nThe automaker\u2019s net income surged a very impressive 24% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to $2.98 billion, while its automotive operating cash flow soared 61% year-over-year to $3.6 billion.\n\nMoreover, GM increased its 2024 EPS guidance to $9-$10, versus its previous target of $8.50-$9.50.\n\nMultiple Wall Street analysts were pleased with the company\u2019s results and bullish on the outlook of this option among stocks to buy.\n\nFor example, Swiss bank UBS, calling GM one of the best names in the auto sector, increased its price target on the name to $58.

        "title": "15 Best Cheap Stocks To Buy For 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 15 best cheap stocks to buy for 2024. If you\u2019d like to skip our overview of investing and some recent financial news, then please take a look at the 5 Best Cheap Stocks To Buy For 2024.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve may take its time in reducing interest rates, as investors have likely observed in recent weeks, the economy continues to expand, and inflation remains far from the levels seen in late 2022. The beginning of the year 2024 prompts reflection, leading some investors to reassess their portfolios. Last year, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite surged by 24% and 43%, respectively, offering passive investors tracking index funds a significant gain as the year drew to a close. Now, the question on everyone's mind is whether the markets will maintain their strong performance from 2023 or potentially reach new highs.\n\nOf course, recent economic indicators indicate that the US economy specifically continues to display resilience and is performing better than expected, dispelling fears of a recession. The Commerce Department's report on economic growth reveals that the US economy grew by 3.1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2023, propelled by strong consumer spending in sectors such as healthcare, dining out, and automobiles. Furthermore, according to Economic Intelligence's consumer goods and retail outlook report for 2024, global retail sales are forecasted to increase by 6.7% during the year. This growth is attributed to a 2% rise in volume, which is partially offset by a slowdown in inflation.\n\nOn another front, the first month of this year saw job growth experience a notably robust increase, underscoring the resilience of the U.S. labor market and its potential to drive broader economic expansion. According to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, nonfarm payrolls expanded by 353,000 during the month, surpassing the Dow Jones estimate of 185,000. Additionally, wage growth exhibited strength, with average hourly earnings rising by 0.6%, doubling the monthly estimate. On a year-over-year basis, wages surged by 4.5%, surpassing the forecast of 4.1%. However, despite this positive trend in wage growth, average hours worked experienced a slight decline, falling to 34.1 hours, down 0.2 hours for the month.\n\nSupported by the strength observed in the labor market, financial analysts anticipate that the positive growth trends observed towards the end of 2023 provide further flexibility for the central bank to take action in reducing interest rates. Ellen Zentner of Morgan Stanley reiterated these views, suggesting that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to decrease rates until the middle of this year, particularly in light of inflation data exceeding expectations. Zentner also noted that spending among affluent households in the United States remains robust, as there have been no significant layoffs among white-collar workers thus far.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn such a market scenario, prospective investors aiming to enter the stock market may consider exploring relatively cheap stocks with promising growth prospects in the foreseeable future. This category may include companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), among others listed below. 15 Best Cheap Stocks To Buy For 2024\n\nPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of best cheap stocks to buy for 2024, we shortlisted 15 stocks based on their forward P/E ratios (as of April 20). We made use of stock screeners to list down stocks that have favorable forward P/E ratios compared to their trailing P/E ratios. Typically, a stock exhibiting a lower forward price-to-earnings ratio compared to the trailing price-to-earnings ratio indicates that analysts are expecting earnings for the stock to increase.\n\nFor the best cheap stocks, we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n15. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 36\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of April 20: 9.42\n\nBased in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and incorporated in Delaware, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is a prominent American bank holding company.

Barrick is also a major copper producer. Former Goldman Sachs executive John Thornton took control of the company in 2012 and quickly realized he wanted someone with a mining background to run the company. Mark Bristow, at that time CEO of Randgold, was considered one of the best gold mining executives in the world. Thornton wanted Bristow so badly Barrick bought Randgold in 2018. Bristow, who is South African, had extensive experience operating mines throughout Africa, and in fact would fly his own single engine plane to visit mines. He has his PhD in Geology, and he has flourished running Barrick the past five years.\n\nBarrick is estimated to have $1.6 billion of net income this year on $11.5 billion of revenue. Net Income has been growing 15% per year. The stock trades at $19.00 per share which is 16 times forward earnings, and the stock has a 3.15% dividend yield.

The company boasts a diversified deposits base with about 80% FDIC insured, well above industry average. It is the only major bank 100% in the cloud, which enables better underwriting and quicker response to changes in the environment. This technology also helps reduce operating and fraud cost while freeing up cash flow for reinvestment in marketing to grow products (Venture X card) and build its brand. Periods of stress, like we saw in the banking sector during March, are a reminder of the underwriting acumen and high quality deposits of Capital One. We added to our position after the fallout, knowing that the company\u2019s seasoned management team had steered capably through previous cycles. Today, as credit card delinquencies have risen to more normal levels, Capital One is already reporting a slowing in delinquency growth. Conversely, some peers saw prior underwriting missteps begin to surface in 2023. Currently trading at 9 times 2024 consensus earnings and around book value, we remain enthusiastic about the investment.\u201d\n\n10. Verizon Communications Inc.

        "title": "Hertz loses another $200 million from its EVs",
        "content": "Car rental operator Hertz (HTZ) reported it lost another $200 million due to its EV gamble.\n\nIn its first quarter earnings report, Hertz said it \u201cupsized\u201d its prior EV fleet drawdown plans by an additional 10,000 EVs, which led to the company incurring a $195 million charge to vehicle depreciation for writing down the value of EVs held for sale.\n\nThe company previously said it would sell off 20,000 EVs from its fleet, meaning it will now dispose of 30,000 EVs in its fleet through the end of 2024. Add today\u2019s charge to the $245 million write-down taken in Q4, and the company has now lost $440 million on its EV gambit.\n\nHertz\u2019s EV fleet \u2014 which once stood at 60,000 EVs, will be cut down to half that at 30,000 EVs. A third of Hertz\u2019s EV fleet was from Tesla (TSLA), with the rest coming from Polestar (PSNY), Volvo (VLVLY), and Chevrolet (GM).\n\nFor the quarter, Hertz reported an adjusted loss of $1.28 a share, wider than the $0.44 loss analysts were expecting. Hertz reported an adjusted net income loss of $392 million, more than double the $147 million loss expected.\n\nHertz stock was down 20% in midday trading.\n\nHertz\u2019s depreciation per unit (DPU) soared to $592 in the first quarter, jumping from the $498 it saw last quarter and more than double the $253 it reported in Q1 last year. Hertz blamed the deterioration in DPU on losses from the sales of gas-powered vehicles as well as on losses from the market value of EVs in its fleet and from the disposition of other EVs.\n\nThere weren\u2019t just financial costs to Hertz\u2019s EV bet. Last month, Hertz\u2019s then-CEO Stephen Scherr, who spearheaded the plan to go all in on EVs, was replaced by Gil West, former COO of GM\u2019s Cruise autonomous unit and, prior to that, COO of Delta Air Lines.\n\n\"Fleet and direct operating costs weighed on this quarter's performance,\" Hertz CEO Gil West said in a statement. \"We're tackling both issues \u2014 getting to the right supply of vehicles at an acceptable capital cost while at the same time driving productivity up and operating costs down.\" Behind the scenes at the Hertz \"Plugged In\" commercial showcasing seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady recharging at Hertz. (Eric R. Davidson/Getty Images for HERTZ) (Eric R. Davidson via Getty Images)\n\nHertz was an early adopter of EVs, announcing in 2021 that it would buy 100,000 Teslas in a marketing campaign starring former NFL quarterback Tom Brady. At the time, Hertz, which was only a few months out of bankruptcy, saw its stock jump 10%, with Tesla shares jumping in sympathy. Tesla went on to top $1 trillion in market capitalization for the first time.\n\nHertz also struck a deal with Polestar in February 2022 to buy 65,000 of its EVs, though Hertz informed Polestar in February 2023 that it would be pausing future purchases of its EVs.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Hertz is paring back its EV offerings in its fleet, EV sales are still growing at the retail level, although at a slower pace. GM CFO Paul Jacobson said as much this week following the automaker's earnings report, claiming that EVs were still popular among its retail customers, but fleet operators, such as large corporations, government entities, and car rental chains, are cutting back purchases.\n\n\"We\u2019ve obviously seen a lot of softness in fleet, particularly on the rental side for EVs, but we see [retail] customers responding,\" Jacobson said.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "10 Best Consumer Discretionary Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Analysts",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best consumer discretionary dividend stocks to buy according to analysts. You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer discretionary sector and its performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nConsumer discretionary stocks are highly influenced by market conditions and consumer sentiment. These equities perform exceptionally well during periods of a bullish economy and when consumer spending is high. The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary had one of the best years on record in 2023, returning over 41%. The index is down by 1.89% this year so far due to wavering consumer confidence. Shopping habits among people have reverted back to normal after the pandemic, which has led to a notable rise in online sales. Wall Street analysts have expressed their confidence in continued consumer spending. According to data from Bloomberg Intelligence, analysts anticipate that revenue and earnings for consumer discretionary companies in the S&P 500 will exceed overall market growth for the second consecutive year in 2024.\n\nThis outlook is supported by the sector\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter of 2023. During this period, the average gross margin for both consumer discretionary and consumer staples companies within the Russell 3000 grew to 34%, compared to 31% four quarters earlier, as reported by Bloomberg. In contrast, the average gross margin for firms in the broader index, representing about 98% of investable US equities, slightly rose to 40% from 39% over the same period. The report further referred to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices and mentioned that consumer discretionary and consumer staples companies in the S&P 500 ramped up their share buybacks significantly. Consumer discretionary firms increased their spending by 53%, while consumer staples saw an even larger increase of 80% in Q4 2023. These figures exceeded the average growth of 18% observed for the broader index.\n\nThough the sector has reported losses this year so far, analysts are positive about its performance going forward. Jordan Michaels, a Fidelity Sector Portfolio Manager, suggested that lower inflation and a pause to the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-hike cycle could prove beneficial for the sector. This could lead to increased consumer willingness to invest in significant purchases like automobiles or homes. In addition to this, the sector may benefit further from an economic scenario where the economy avoids recession and labor markets maintain strength. He further mentioned that there is a potential value in the retail companies within the sector. Here are some of his comments:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOne particular continued area of opportunity has been select retailers. Some of these companies have defensive aspects to their business models, which could provide a degree of insulation if the economic outlook worsens.\u201d\n\nIn addition to delivering strong performance in 2023, the consumer discretionary sector also distributed the highest dividends during this period. According to a report by the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index, the companies in the industry led the way with the highest percentage increase in annual dividends, achieving a notable 26.1% year-over-year growth. The sector showed a 13.7% growth in its dividend payments on an underlying basis, which is also the highest among all the sectors. The report also highlighted that annual dividends in the consumer discretionary sector have grown from $80.7 billion in 2017 to $106.8 billion in 2023.\n\nNIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) are some of the best dividend stocks from the consumer discretionary sector among others that are discussed below. 10 Best Consumer Discretionary Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nA side profile of a consumer within a store handing a credit card to a cashier, reflecting the debt collection services of the company.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned the 53 holdings of the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index.

        "title": "General Motors (GM) Is Attractively Priced Despite Fast-paced Momentum",
        "content": "Momentum investors typically don't time the market or \"buy low and sell high.\" In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that \"buying high and selling higher\" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.\n\nEveryone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.\n\nA safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (GM) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:\n\nA dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 1.1%, the stock of this company is certainly well-positioned in this regard.\n\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. GM meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 16.2% over the past 12 weeks.\n\nMoreover, the momentum for GM is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.51. This indicates that the stock moves 51% higher than the market in either direction.\n\nGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that GM has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.\n\nIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped GM earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nStory continues\n\nMost importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, GM is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. GM is currently trading at 0.29 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 29 cents for each dollar of sales.\n\nSo, GM appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.\n\nIn addition to GM, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.\n\nThis is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

        "title": "The Top 3 Auto Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "The auto industry is one of the longest-living sectors in stocks, and almost everyone knows the major players. As they are visible to the general public, auto companies are some of the first stocks investors contemplate. However, automotive companies are also some of the first to feel the effects of economic conditions like inflation on their performances.\n\nThat is not to mention the surge of popularity and attention surrounding electric vehicles (EVs). Their impact on the auto sector is undeniable as companies race to produce their EV models. Despite the stiff competition and grueling climate, some automakers stand above the rest in stock performance.\n\nLet\u2019s find out about the top three auto stocks to purchase in April. These stocks have had extraordinary quarterly performances and surging momentum that will likely continue.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFord Motor Company (F) Ford logo badge on grill of car\n\nSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord Motor Company (NYSE:F) is one of the oldest American auto companies. Despite its long history, Ford remains one of the best-performing auto stocks, reporting $46 billion in income in Q4 and a free cash flow of almost $7 billion for 2023. Also, sales increased by over 180,000 units compared to 2022, driving a jump in price this year. So far, Ford has reported an incredible 86% jump year-over-year (YOY) in EV sales this quarter, further propelling the stock upwards.\n\nWith numbers like these, many are hoping for even more promising earnings in the upcoming earnings report and are making their buys now. In addition to the estimated boost in revenue and sales for the rest of this year, Ford is making strides to cut expenses by $2 billion and increase YOY income.\n\nIf you are worried about sales slowing down, you might be happy to hear that Ford is making efforts to accelerate sales of its popular EV models. Earlier this month, Ford announced that it would be cutting the price of its F-150 lightning model by more than $5,500 to make it more affordable.\n\nFord is on track to set historic numbers for this year, and investors should buy as soon as possible.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is another proven American automotive stock. It has consistently held solid quarterly performances leading up to this year. Shares have risen in 2024 due to solid momentum after a profitable Q4 in 2023. However, GM released its Q1 earnings for this year on April 23. The company reports a massive earnings beat that will carry this momentum even further.\n\nStory continues\n\nGM smashed revenue and adjusted EPS estimates and has already climbed by 5% as a result. Further, the report is triggering a slight boost to the company\u2019s expectations for the rest of this year. Increasing are free cash flow and adjusted EPS estimates by 150%.\n\nNet income has risen 26% this quarter compared to last year, and GM attributes this success to the fantastic numbers reported in North American sales. Also, the company notes the astonishing sales helped less than satisfactory performance in the Chinese market.\n\nFinally, GM is set to ramp up EV production this year, staying ahead of the game to continue magnificent momentum off the back of a strong earnings beat. Investors should not hesitate to buy GM as the stock soars with impressive sales this year.\n\nFerrari (RACE) A close-up of the Ferrari logo on a red car with drops of water\n\nSource: Konstantin Egorychev / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnlike the other stocks on this list and many different auto stocks, Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) is a luxury automotive brand producing high-end vehicles. While stocks that target such niche markets are often less appealing, you may be surprised by Ferrari\u2019s performance over the last five years.\n\nIn fact, the price has risen by more than 300% over the past five years. And, the company has consistently reported rock-solid financials. In Q4 of 2023, diluted EPS was up 33.88%, and the profit margin increased by nearly 20% year over year.\n\nSlightly dipping this year, the company will announce first-quarter results on May 7. Given Ferrari\u2019s incredibly consistent history, this quarter will likely bring some excellent momentum back to the stock.\n\nWhile the stock is expensive, there is no question about the company\u2019s quality and ability to produce consistent results and returns. Investors can watch and consider adding it to their portfolio before it skyrockets in price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "GM is on the rise\u2014but for now, EVs are holding it back, not leading the charge",
        "content": "Legacy automaker General Motors reported strong profits Tuesday, despite lagging sales in China and price cuts to some of its models. But beneath the surface, the automaker's strong financial performance is powered by gas: GM\u2019s quarterly gains were led by its popular SUVs and gas-powered car lines, while producing EVs continues to lose the company money.\n\nGM\u2019s stock went on a hot streak last quarter, buoyed in part by falling raw materials prices for its EV batteries. Share prices peaked at $45 in late March, up from a low of $27 last November. Its stock surged another 6.5% following the earnings release.\n\nThe strategy that delivered GM\u2019s strong financials represents a departure from the \u201call-in\u201d EV strategy the company has been pushing for years. GM\u2019s earnings are a win, but underline that the company will have to solve the problem of EV profitability to keep the ball rolling\u2014a hurdle GM representatives say they\u2019re on the verge of clearing.\n\n\u201cThere's no denying it: GM had a nice quarter,\u201d wrote Piper Sandler analyst Alex Potter in a note issued after the earnings release. \u201cHowever, as always, there's a caveat. GM's 2024 guidance\u2026 implies significant margin degradation in [the second half of 2024], due to rising EV sales. Nobody really knows how well (or how poorly) the EV launch will go.\u201d\n\nGM\u2019s EV rollout has faced a bumpy road, in line with the rest of the industry. GM has been one of the more aggressive legacy automakers when it comes to EV strategy, committing to phase out all of its gas-powered vehicles by 2035 and spending billions on new EV production capacity. But, along with its peers, it\u2019s faced challenges: Its EV production numbers have routinely fallen below expectations, and it has yet to turn a profit on its electric models.\n\nEVs were in the backseat Tuesday, though. GM beat analysts\u2019 expectations and raised its profit projections by half a billion dollars, to a target range of $12.5\u2013$14.5 billion, largely off the back of its bread-and-butter gas-vehicle line. GM sold 3% more Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks than a year prior, CEO Mary Barra told analysts in a call following the earnings release. In an SEC disclosure, GM cited strong sales of trucks and SUVs for generating increases in net sales and revenue.\n\nGM doesn\u2019t specifically report the financial results of its EV line, but CFO Paul Jacobson said that the company continues to lose money on its electric cars. It, along with other automakers, has struggled to solve the puzzle of making EVs affordable for average consumers and profitable at scale. CEO Barra said that \u201cEV adoption in luxury segments is higher and more resilient than in the broader market.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nGM\u2019s EV project does show promising signs, though. Its production costs have declined, in part because bets on in-house battery manufacturing are finally paying off: Barra said GM tripled its battery production in the last six months, and GM said in its quarterly report that it plans to spend roughly $11 billion more on battery manufacturing this year. (Falling commodity prices for lithium, a key component in EV batteries, have also provided a tailwind.)\n\nFurther, GM is bullish on EVs starting to make the company money, not lose it\u2014potentially as soon as this year. GM spokesperson Jim Cain told Fortune the company expects its North American EV vertical to be profit-positive by the end of this year, largely due to increases in battery and overall vehicle production.\n\n\u201cWe feel pretty good about that\u2026 When we improve the profit margins, the EV portfolio becomes less of a drag overall,\u201d Cain said. \u201cWe're in a process of rapidly scaling. We think we can potentially get to 200,000 to 300,000 units of EV production this year.\u201d\n\nSelling more affordable EVs will be a priority for GM: The current market is dominated by expensive luxury offerings that remain out of reach for many consumers. Tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act are helping, but Barra said GM expects to start rolling out low-price models such as a new Chevy Bolt EV late next year.\n\n\u201cThe next-generation Ultium-based Chevrolet Bolt EV is another,\u201d Barra told analysts. \u201cIt's a profitable and capital-efficient program that will deliver one of the most affordable electric vehicles around when it arrives in late 2025.\u201d\n\nTo an extent, the auto industry\u2019s EV future is a shotgun marriage: When it comes to phasing out ICE cars and producing more electric units, the industry doesn\u2019t have a choice. New federal rules require carmakers to dramatically reduce their emissions by 2032, effectively forcing them to switch most of their production to EVs. (GM is one of multiple automakers that has made internal commitments to transition its fleet to electric as fast as or faster than what the government is requiring.) That means GM and other automakers can only coast on profits from gas-powered vehicles for so long.\n\n\u201cEven with the recent decline in battery raw material costs, EV profitability is challenging, particularly with new pricing pressure,\u201d Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan wrote in a note following GM\u2019s earnings release. \u201cHowever, US fuel economy regulations will likely force automakers to sell EVs to meet targets.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Ford earnings preview: Guidance update, shifting product strategy key for investors",
        "content": "Ford (F) will report first quarter results after the bell on Wednesday. Its changing product game plan will be front and center with its focus on gas and hybrid offerings to offset heavy spending on EVs.\n\nThe results come after GM reported strong Q1 results and boosted its yearly profit outlook, and investors will be looking to see if Ford can match that performance.\n\nFor the quarter, Ford is expected to report revenue of $40.04 billion, per Bloomberg consensus, a result that would be 3.5% lower than a year ago. Ford is also expected to post adjusted earnings per share of $0.42 on adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of $2.54 billion. Ford\u2019s results should be slightly better than those in Q4, when it was dealing with the lingering effects of the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike.\n\nLast year Ford divided its business into three units: Ford Blue, for traditional gas-powered autos; Ford Model e, for the EV division; and Ford Pro, for its commercial and super duty truck business. Here's the expected breakdown:\n\nFord Blue: $24.57 billion in revenue, EBIT of $1.65 million Model e: $1.22 billion in revenue, EBIT loss of $1.36 billion Ford Pro: $15.28 billion in revenue, EBIT of $2.19 billion\n\nDuring the first quarter, Ford pushed deeper into its gas and hybrid vehicles, with EV spending and production taking a back seat. Earlier this month, Ford said that it is pushing back EV production at its massive BlueOval City EV campus in Tennessee to 2026 from its initial 2025 start date. Ford also revealed it is \u201cretiming\u201d the launch of upcoming EVs at its plant in Oakville, Ontario, where it plans to build next-generation three-row EVs, and most likely a full-size SUV. The company is aiming to launch those vehicles in 2027, pushing back the original 2025 timeline.\n\nFord also said earlier in the quarter it would add a third shift to boost production of its Bronco SUV and midsize ranger pickup to meet customer demand. Meanwhile, Ford is focusing on its hybrid offerings, like the Maverick pickup and brand new F-150 with hybrid powertrain.\n\nThis was reflected in Ford\u2019s Q1 US deliveries which jumped 6.8% to 508,083 vehicles, powered by strong sales of electrified products such as hybrids. Ford\u2019s Maverick hybrid pickup saw its best quarter ever, with sales jumping 77% in the first quarter. Maverick also powered overall hybrid sales to a 42% jump to 38,421, with Ford claiming this was also the best quarter for hybrids and that momentum will continue. The new Ford F-150 truck is launched at a celebratory event at the Ford Dearborn Plant on April 11, 2024, in Dearborn, Michigan. (Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images) (Bill Pugliano via Getty Images)\n\nEven Ford's EV offerings \u2014 the Mustang Mach-E, Ford Lightning EV, and its commercial E-Transit vans \u2014bucked the recent trend of softening demand. Ford\u2019s overall EV portfolio saw a massive 82% jump to 20,223 EVs sold in Q1, with the Mustang Mach-E jumping 77.3% to 9,589 units sold and the Lightning pickup seeing sales surge 80.4% to 7,743 units. While the sales numbers here are strong, Ford relied on heavy discounting, cheap financing rates, and lease deals to move inventory.\n\nStory continues\n\nA down note for Ford, however, was its flagship F-150 sales. Though the F-Series (which includes the F-150 and heavy-duty F-250 and F-350 offerings) retained the crown of America\u2019s top-selling truck, sales fell 10.2% in the quarter to 152,943 units. Ford has experienced a slow ramp-up of the all-new F-150, which started sales in March.\n\nUpdated guidance will also be key to Ford\u2019s stock performance. In late March, Ford CFO John Lawler reiterated 2024 guidance that Ford provided in early February, projecting adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $10 billion to $12 billion, adjusted free cash flow of $6 billion to $7 billion, and capital expenditures of $8 billion to $9.5 billion.\n\nInvestors and analysts will likely require Ford to boost its full-year profit guidance following a similar move by GM. GM now sees full-year adjusted EBIT of $12.5 billion-$14.5 billion, up from prior outlook of $12 billion-$14 billion.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Honda set to announce mega EV and battery complex Thursday, says source",
        "content": "honda-canada-0428-ph\n\nHonda Motor Co. Ltd. is set to announce that it will build a new electric-vehicle and battery manufacturing operation in Canada on Thursday morning in Alliston, Ont., according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nTwo other sources said they expect the Japanese automaker to make an announcement this week, and added that it will be the largest EV and battery complex in Canada ever announced.\n\nHonda has confirmed it is holding discussions with \u201call levels of government\u201d in Canada and considering expanding its local operations, but declined to comment further.\n\nA spokesperson for Simcoe County \u2014 where Alliston is located \u2014 also declined to comment on any proposed plans, but described Honda as \u201can important partner, providing thousands of jobs to people across the county while investing in our communities.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHonda currently manufactures its CRV and Civic models in Alliston \u2014 about 85 kilometres north of Toronto \u2014 and has said it plans to produce only electrified vehicles by 2040. Honda Motor Co.\u2019s plant in Alliston, Ontario, where the Japanese automaker is expected to make the announcement of a EV and battery manufacturing complex.\n\nThe announcement could mark a shift in clean technology incentive policy in Canada. In recent years, the federal government wooed Volkswagen AG and Stellantis NV to build battery cell manufacturing plants by offering lucrative production tax credits, similar to what would be available in the United States under the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThose were specific deals negotiated with VW and Stellantis.\n\nShift in EV incentives\n\nBut sources said the federal government is wooing Honda through different incentives. The 2024 federal budget, released last week, proposes a new Electric Vehicle Supply Chain tax credit of 10 per cent on the cost of any building.\n\nThe credit would be effective until 2032, decline to five per cent in 2033 and 2034, and then expire. The budget estimated it would cost $80 million over five years, plus an additional $1.02 billion between 2029-30 and 2034-35.\n\nTo be eligible, a company must claim the Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit \u2014 which is a 30 per cent credit on applicable new machinery and equipment \u2014 in three segments of the supply chain: EV assembly, EV battery production and cathode active material production.\n\nStory continues\n\nA company can invest in only two of the three segments if it owns a minority interest in a company that invests in the third segment.\n\nThat tax policy, introduced in the 2023 budget, contains a proposed sunset clause of 2035.\n\nSo far, neither tax proposal has been passed into law.\n\nSources also said the federal government is interested in moving away from one-off deals with individual companies for production tax credits, and towards a more open policy that companies can claim for making investments in Canada.\n\nGM, Ford could tap tax credit\n\nThat would mean other automakers, including General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co., which already have investments in the EV supply chain, could also eventually be eligible for the 10 per cent tax credit proposed in the 2024 budget.\n\nFor example, GM assembles BrightDrop EV at its CAMI plant in Ingersoll, Ont., and is building a cathode active material plant in B\u00e9cancour, Que. It could qualify for the tax credit by either building a battery cell manufacturing plant, or by owning a minority interest in a company that builds a battery plant in Canada.\n\nFord has proposed retooling its Oakville, Ont., assembly plant so it can produce EVs.\n\nSources said Honda may receive other incentives as well. The federal government has not always immediately disclosed the details of its deals with automakers investing in the battery and EV supply chain.\n\nThere are also provincial incentives in the form of loans and direct support, which when combined with the federal incentives collectively amount to more than $1 billion across a half-dozen projects.\n\nCanada aims to attract Honda and others with EV tax incentives VW hones in on manufacturing EV 'battery of the future' in Canada Canada hopes to buy way into EV revolution\n\nOntario\u2019s Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade said via email that the province has attracted more than $28 billion in EV and battery supply chain-related investments in the past three years.\n\nA spokesperson said the ministry does not discuss specific prospective projects, but noted: \u201cWe are grateful for Honda\u2019s longstanding history in Ontario, and will continue to seek out opportunities to promote job growth and ensure Ontario remains a competitive jurisdiction.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Email: gfriedman@postmedia.com\n\nBookmark our website and support our journalism: Don\u2019t miss the business news you need to know \u2014 add financialpost.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here.",

        "content": "General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript April 23, 2024\n\nGeneral Motors Company beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $2.62, expectations were $2.15. General Motors Company isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good morning and welcome to the General Motors Company First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. We are asking analysts to limit their questions to one and a brief follow-up. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, April 23rd, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAshish Kohli: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. On today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC.\n\nPlease review the Safe Harbor statement on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary Barra: Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. In January, we outlined clear priorities for 2024 that are designed to build on our strength and learn from the challenges we faced in 2023. I'm very pleased to share that the team is executing well against all of them. Around the world, we are very focused on growth and profitability, which means taking full advantage of our winning product portfolio to grow share without chasing unprofitable business. In North America, the fundamental strengths of Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac truly stand out. The team delivered a 10.6% EBIT margin in the quarter, thanks to our industry-leading full-size pickups, the momentum we're building in midsized pickups, the growth we are seeing in our SUV business, profit improvement in our EV portfolio and our overall operating discipline.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe again grew retail shares and market share in the US during the quarter with incentives that remained well below the industry average, especially in our truck business. We grew our combined Chevrolet and GMC full-size pickup sales by 3% year-over-year and grew our retail market share 1.8 points to 43.8% with much lower incentives than our closest competitors whose sales were down. In March, we doubled sales of the GMC Canyon year-over-year. And the Chevrolet Colorado was the fastest-growing truck in the midsize pickup segment, thanks to its purity of function, simple elegance in execution and value. Those are MotorTrend's words, not mine. We also continue to gain market share and grow EBIT with our new small SUVs, including the Chevrolet Trax and the Buick Envista.\n\nThese vehicles are helping us win new customers, and we will continue to excel at customer retention. During the quarter, S&P Global Mobility announced that GM has now had the highest loyalty of any OEM for nine consecutive years. That's a powerful competitive advantage. In our EV business, we are building momentum in production and profitability. For example, we have increased battery module production by 300% over the last six months. Quality is very good and continuing to improve. And the installation and validation of our new high-speed module assembly lines is on track. We are projecting to double our current capacity by the end of the summer. EV production rose sharply during the quarter, and our dealers translated that into a 21% year-over-year increase in EV retail customer deliveries.\n\nFor example, the Cadillac LYRIQ outsold all of the EVs from European luxury brands in the first quarter. And since mid-March, we are now delivering Chevrolet Blazer EVs with updated and improved software. All of our product programs are benefiting from the end-to-end improvements we've made in software, including the increased rigor we have instilled in our quality and validation processes. More importantly, the talented executives and engineers we've hired from the tech industry are raising the bar for software design and execution, which will help us truly differentiate our customer experience and the suite of software-driven products and services we offer. We're also making progress at Cruise. The team is back on the road in Phoenix updating mapping, gathering more road information.\n\nThis is a critical step for validating our improved self-driving system and building upon the more than 5 million driverless miles we've logged before the pause. We are engaging frequently with regulators and stakeholders and building trust as we regain momentum. Safety will remain front and center and will guide our progress. I am pleased with our ICE performance, our progress in EV execution and growth, our new software organization's performance and the steps we're taking to regain momentum at Cruise. In addition, I'm very proud of the GM team and all of our stakeholders for really leaning in to keep our momentum going. Their commitment and tenacity helped give us the confidence to raise our full year 2024 EBIT, EPS and automotive adjusted free cash flow guidance.\n\nIn our ICE business, the redesigned Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Chevrolet Equinox are all launching in high-volume segments starting this quarter. So are the Chevrolet Spin and the S10 in South America, and they have higher margins than the outgoing models. Then this summer, the stunning new Buick Enclave will arrive. It's the first Enclave to offer Super Cruise. Later in the year, we will make important design and technology upgrades to our best-selling GMC Yukon, Chevrolet Tahoe and Chevrolet Suburban full-size SUVs. They include redesigned, tech-focused interiors, safety and security features that include a suite of connected cameras, riding handling improvements, styling enhancements and more. Mark and our performance team also have the unbelievable Corvette ZR1 coming and we can't wait to put customers behind the wheel.\n\nAnd we've already begun installing equipment at our Fort Wayne assembly plant to produce our next-generation full-size ICE pickups. In our EV business, the Ultium Cell plant in Spring Hill is shipping sales and scaling production through the year. The Chevrolet Equinox EV will arrive in showrooms this quarter, and we're very excited because it will be the most affordable long-range EV in the market. It will also offer Super Cruise like all of our Chevrolet GMC and Cadillac EVs on the Ultium platform. We will then introduce more affordable trim series for the Chevrolet Equinox EV, the Blazer EV and the Silverado EV in the second half of the year, which will help grow volume and share. Also in the second half of the year, Cadillac will expand its EV lineup to include the OPTIQ and the Escalade IQ.\n\nThis is important because EV adoption in luxury segments is higher and more resilient than in the broader market. Two of our most highly anticipated launches are the GMC Sierra EV Denali and the Chevrolet Silverado EV RST. They are best-in-class in ways that truly matter to truck customers. By optimizing the battery, aerodynamics and other systems, we were able to increase the range of the RST and the Denali by 10% to an estimated 440 miles, which is about 40 miles better than the median range of ICE vehicles on the road today. No EV pickup on the road today even comes close and it's possible to go even further. A few weeks ago, two road testers took the RST on a drive from Las Vegas to Phoenix. And they drove it like customers do on paved and gravel roads at freeway speeds at different temperatures and different elevations.\n\nAt the end, they managed to travel 460 miles on a single charge. It's the same story for towing. One journalist drove a Silverado EV work truck and three competing battery electric trucks on a 500-mile trip over the Rocky Mountains while towing trailers. It wasn't even a competition. The Silverado EV stopped once to charge, while every other truck had to stop four to five times. Chevrolet and GMC are also the only pickup brands that allow drivers to tow while using Super Cruise, our hands-free driving technology. That's just one of the several features that uniquely differentiates our products. This is exactly the kind of design and engineering functionality that excites people, motivates them and turns them into customers. It's the same formula for Chevrolet and GMC have filed with ICE trucks, and those results speak for themselves.\n\nBased on the feedback we're hearing from customers and dealers, the early sales momentum we are seeing, we're confident that continuing to scale EV production is the right move. We know that transparency matters in every transformation. So Paul and I will give you regular updates throughout the year, including at our Investor Day we're planning for this fall as we achieve our EV production, sales and profitability milestones. All of these great ICE and EV products were made possible by the investments we made to drive transformation and growth. As a result, our spending was above historic levels for several years. Now that the foundation is largely built and we're starting to see results, our focus has turned back to driving free cash flow through enhanced profitability and capital discipline, finding ways to spend less for the same results and with an unwavering focus on the customer. A group of technicians in a garage, inspecting car parts and ensuring safety compliance.\n\nYou're already seeing some examples of this. Our winning with simplicity discipline is a great example of how we're improving capital efficiency and lowering costs. The next-generation Ultium-based Chevrolet Bolt EV is another. It's a profitable and capital-efficient program that will deliver one of the most affordable electric vehicles around when it arrives in late 2025. There will be many more examples as we move forward. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Paul to take you through our results and our new higher guidance for the calendar year.\n\nPaul Jacobson: Thank you, Mary, and I appreciate you all joining us this morning. We're off to a good start to the year and I'd like to thank our team for all their hard work in helping deliver another strong set of financial results. We experienced consistent pricing trends during the quarter, below the 2% to 2.5% headwind we built into our full year guidance. For Q1, pricing was down only about $200 million year-over-year driven by demand for our products and a disciplined go-to-market strategy that prioritizes profitability and margins. And so far in April, we've seen pricing remain relatively consistent. That said, our comparisons get tougher as we lap price increases taken in Q2 of last year. The US retail industry experienced a slight mix shift away from the full-size truck segment during the quarter.\n\nHowever, we increased our volume and share with lower incentives than our competitors, which speaks to our strong truck franchises and our customer loyalty. Retail sales were up 6%, while fleet sales decreased more than 20% driven by two main factors. First, we encountered some production constraints impacting the timing of fleet deliveries on our commercial van and midsize pickups. We expect to recover most of this volume in the second half of the year. Second, we made the strategic decision to produce more retail full-size SUVs compared to last year to satisfy our strong customer demand. Retail sales on our full-size SUVs have a higher trim mix that earned us more revenue per vehicle. We are committed to growing our strong and profitable fleet business, but we'll continue to balance fleet and retail customer demands with a focus on profitability.\n\nWe generated healthy cash flow during the quarter, helping support $600 million of year-to-date open market stock repurchases incremental to the ongoing ASR, retiring another 14 million shares since the beginning of the year. We now have approximately $800 million remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization. In addition, we completed the first tranche of the $10 billion ASR last fall, retiring 4 million shares in Q1. Our fully diluted share count at the end of the quarter was 1.16 billion, down 17% from where we were just one year ago. Given the strong momentum we've seen thus far and our confidence in the 2024 outlook, we are raising full year guidance to EBIT adjusted in the $12.5 billion to $14.5 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted to the $9 to $10 range and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $8.5 billion to $10.5 billion range.\n\nNow let's get into the Q1 results. We grew total company revenue by 8% to $43 billion driven by higher wholesale volumes in North America. Over the last 24 months, we've achieved consistent revenue growth, resulting in a CAGR of more than 15% over that period. We also achieved $3.9 billion in EBIT adjusted, 9.0% EBIT adjusted margins and $2.62 in EPS diluted adjusted. EBIT adjusted was up year-over-year and well above consensus driven by our continued strong ICE performance, improving EV profitability and our strategic cost actions, mitigating the effect of higher labor costs. We achieved adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.1 billion, up materially versus being flat in Q1 of 2023 driven by improved working capital benefits through inventory management and production timing.\n\nNorth America delivered Q1 EBIT adjusted margins of 10.6%, driving $3.8 billion of EBIT adjusted, up $300 million year-over-year primarily from higher wholesale volumes combined with steady pricing and ongoing cost containment. During the quarter, we continued to benefit from our fixed cost reduction program, realizing an incremental $300 million from lower marketing and engineering spend. Our fixed cost base is at its lowest since Q1 2022 and we are on track to achieve the full $2 billion net of depreciation and amortization by the end of 2024. Dealer inventory levels ended the quarter slightly above our 50 to 60 day end-of-year target at 63 days. However, we believe we are well positioned from an inventory standpoint as we head into a seasonally stronger part of the year and incur a few weeks of planned downtime in Q2 on our full-size pickups to prepare for future launches and to install new equipment.\n\nGM International Q1 EBIT adjusted was breakeven, down $350 million year-over-year. China equity income was a loss of $100 million, down $200 million year-over-year as we lowered production to balance dealer inventory levels. This was slightly better-than-expected due to a continued focus on cost efficiencies. Having made progress reducing inventory levels, production is normalizing, and we expect to return to profitability in Q2. EBIT adjusted in GM International excluding China equity income was $100 million, down $150 million year-over-year driven by lower volume in South America and strategic decisions to protect margins. We anticipate new product launches and further cost efficiencies will help drive profitability improvements beginning in Q2.\n\nGM Financial continues to perform well with Q1 EBT adjusted of $700 million, in line with last year and tracking well within the full year $2.5 billion to $3 billion guidance range. They continue to drive portfolio growth and paid a $450 million dividend to GM during the quarter. Cruise expenses were $400 million in the quarter, down from $800 million in Q4 '23, reflecting our cost reduction activities and a more focused operational plan. As Mary mentioned, Cruise is resuming operations in Phoenix, along with testing in simulated environments and on closed courses while they work to earn trust and build partnerships with regulators and customers. We expect full year Cruise expenses to be around $1.7 billion. Let's move now to one of the most important metrics we're focused on, EV profitability.\n\nWe continue to see sequential and year-over-year improvements in variable profit and EBIT margins as we benefit from scale, material cost and mix improvements. Since last year, we have significantly reduced cell costs with a large driver being lower battery raw material costs, especially for lithium. We ramped our first battery JV plant last year, and as they increased production and made other efficiencies, the cost of cells came down significantly. And cell plant number two in Tennessee is ramping even faster based on the learnings from plant one and is expected to reach full installed capacity by the end of the year. Collectively, these factors are helping improve vehicle profitability. For example, we have seen more than $12,000 of year-over-year cost savings in the LYRIQ alone.\n\nAs we continue to ramp, we expect to see the benefits from the production tax credit continue to grow and our fixed cost absorption to improve meaningfully. We wholesaled 22,000 Ultium-based EVs in Q1, up from less than 2,000 in the first quarter of last year and remain on track to achieve our 200,000 to 300,000 unit production and wholesale volume target for 2024. We will share more on EV profitability as we progress through the year. I would also like to touch on EV pricing, which we recently adjusted on the 2024 Blazer EV. This action has been well received by our dealers and customers. And as Mary mentioned, the vehicle is gaining momentum. We assumed some pricing pressure for both ICE and EVs in our business plan and guidance for 2024, but we continue to work on finding additional offsets through cost performance and other efficiencies.\n\nImportantly, this pricing action doesn't change our expectation to achieve positive variable profit for our EV portfolio in the second half of the year or our mid-single-digit margin target in 2025. We remain confident that when consumers see our new EVs and get a chance to drive them, they will appreciate the unique combination of design, performance, range and value that we offer at multiple price points. And because of our supply chain efforts, customers are well positioned to leverage the $7,500 clean energy consumer purchase tax credit. In closing, I want to reiterate our capital allocation framework along with our intention to be much more consistent in how we deploy capital. We are generating strong cash flow, which is funding our EV transformation and growth opportunities.\n\nThese efforts include investing in future products, transitioning manufacturing capacity to EVs and deploying resources into cutting-edge battery technology. At the same time, you've seen us adapt to the dynamic market, particularly for EVs and made bold decisions to be more efficient with our capital spend, something we will continue to do moving forward. Our balance sheet remains strong. And on shareholder returns, we executed the ASR last November and the response has been overwhelmingly positive, with GM stock outperforming its peers and being up nearly 50% since the announcement. We have seen about a one turn improvement in our P/E multiple since the ASR, but we are still significantly undervalued relative to our historical average as well as our competitors and other industrial companies.\n\nObviously, we're not satisfied and know that we have a lot of work to do on our valuation and remain committed to improving it. As we move forward, we believe the strong cash generated by our ICE portfolio along with improved execution on our EV strategy as well as tangible progress on Cruise will help generate significant returns for all GM stakeholders. This concludes our opening comments and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nSee also\n\nLatest Insider Trading Activity: 11 Stocks Executives and Directors are Buying and\n\n13 Best Ethical Companies to Invest in 2024.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By David Shepardson\n\n(Reuters) - General Motors CEO Mary Barra's total compensation in 2023 fell 4% to $27.8 million, the largest U.S. automaker said Wednesday.\n\nThe Detroit automaker also said GM President Mark Reuss' total compensation in 2023 rose to just under $18 million, up from $14.3 million, while Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson's compensation rose to $11.1 million last year, up from $10.2 million. GM general counsel Craig Glidden, who was also named president and chief administrative officer at self-driving unit Cruise last year, received $11.5 million.\n\nGM board member Wesley Bush, who chairs the compensation committee, said in GM's proxy filing the automaker delivered a strong financial performance in 2023, continued to lead the industry in total U.S. sales and returned \"significant cash to shareholders through dividends and the implementation of a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGM did not increase Barra's or Reuss' target compensation for 2024.\n\nBush said GM \"underperformed relative to its commitments on its transformation journey in 2023, particularly with EV production and AV technology\" that impacted GM's stock price, the value of stock options and other executive stock-based compensation.\n\n\"We believe these outcomes demonstrate that our incentive plans operate effectively to appropriately reward both annual and long-term performance,\" Bush wrote.\n\nIn contract talks last year, the United Auto Workers union harshly criticized the compensation of the Detroit Three automakers including Barra, who received $29 million in 2022 in total compensation.\n\nAfter targeted strikes, the UAW's deals for its members secured an immediate 11% pay rise and 25% increase in base wages through 2028.\n\nIn February, Chrysler-parent Stellantis said CEO Carlos Tavares received a 56% boost in total compensation to 36.49 million euros ($39 million) in 2023.\n\nTavares told reporters last week \"90% of my salary is determined by the results of the company, so this proves that the company's results are apparently not too bad.\"\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",

        "title": "Tesla (TSLA) Soars 13.1% After-Hours on Affordable EV Promise",
        "content": "Tesla, Inc.\u2019s TSLA shares rose 2.2% in the last session but soared 13.1% in the after-hours following its first-quarter 2024 earnings. This happened despite the electric vehicles (EV) giant missing both earnings and revenue estimates for the quarter.\n\nEarlier in the month, there were reports that Tesla has shut down its inexpensive car project, the one that investors had been counting on for long to finally catapult it into becoming a mass-market automaker. It had been said that stiff competition from China-based EV makers flooding the market with cars priced as low as $10,000 was the primary reason behind Tesla\u2019s decision. However, Tesla\u2019s stock jumped after the market closed on Apr 23, after the company said it would accelerate the launch of more affordable vehicles, a far cry from scrapping these plans.\n\nCEO Elon Musk said on the earnings call that these new vehicles could be launched by early 2025, if not later this year. Previously, he had targeted the second half of 2025 for the launch of this affordable mass-market car that is popularly referred to as \u201cModel 2\u201d.\n\nThis sent the company\u2019s shares soaring despite disappointing earnings numbers for the quarter. Competition from China, recent high-profile departures and layoffs have also spooked investors. This is one of the primary reasons behind the company\u2019s current rating of a Zacks #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nYet, since September 2023, Tesla's share of the U.S. EV market has grown 1.3 percentage points to 51.3%. This continues to place it as the market leader during this period, during which companies like Hyundai, VW and BMW lost a sizeable chunk of their market share. All eyes will be set now on Tesla\u2019s launch of its much-vaunted Robotaxi model on Aug 8, which would mark yet another watershed moment in EV history.\n\nEVs have been rapidly gaining ground since the pandemic years, and it is becoming abundantly clear that they are here to stay. Consumers are gradually shifting from cars run on fossil fuels to their environment-friendly alternatives.\n\nWhether Tesla\u2019s fight against the Chinese tide brings about a sea-change in the EV market in general remains to be seen. It would be prudent to keep a tab on a few of its competitors to understand the scenario and decide whether to invest in the sector.\n\nFord Motor Company F, General Motors Company GM and Mercedes-Benz Group AG MBGAF are three other automobile majors that have emerged as the leading lights in the American EV segment. BYD Auto from China has surpassed Tesla as the global market leader in the EV segment. Ford, General Motors and Mercedes each carry a Zacks #3 (Hold) currently. In the near term, it will be essential to follow this space to check the emergence of newer, non-traditional automakers that have entered the EV space. However, the spotlight today is fixed on Tesla.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Quit scanning the market for a reasonably priced stock! Your search ends as Magna International (NYSE:MGA) offers growth, value and yield. Plus, it\u2019s a company that most U.S.-based investors don\u2019t know about. Consequently, you have access to an underappreciated opportunity right now with Magna International stock.\n\nJust to recap, Magna International is a Canada-based provider of automotive technology. As we\u2019ll discover, the company is teaming up with an iconic American automaker. This adds to the already impressive value proposition you\u2019ll find with Magna International.\n\nMagna International Collaborates With a Famous Automaker\n\nSo, let\u2019s dive right into the details. Magna International is collaborating withGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) and technology services and consulting firm Wipro (NYSE:WIT) to develop a business-to-business sales platform for the buying and selling of automotive software.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis platform, known as SDVerse, is described as a \u201cmatchmaking platform for buyers and sellers of embedded automotive software.\u201d\n\nSDVerse is intended to reduce the time, costs and complexities involved in the currently available automotive software procurement processes.\n\nAs I see it, there\u2019s a vast moneymaking opportunity here for all parties. According to Harmeet Chauhan, Global Head Wipro Engineering Edge, Wipro Limited, \u201cThe market for automotive software is expected to nearly double this decade.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Magna International\u2019s team-up with General Motors and Wipro should provide long-term benefits for the three companies and their stakeholders.\n\nMagna International\u2019s Amazing Earnings Growth\n\nCertainly, the SDVerse partnership should help Magna International grow its business over the coming years. However, the company is already growing its bottom line quite rapidly.\n\nImpressively, Magna International\u2019s fourth-quarter 2023 adjusted EPS increased 41.5% year over year to $1.33 (versus 94 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter). Furthermore, the company\u2019s quarterly sales increased 9% YOY to $10.5 billion.\n\nThus, Magna International\u2019s growth is indisputable. However, despite its notable growth pace, the company isn\u2019t overvalued at all. On a trailing 12-month basis, Magna International has a GAAP price-to-earnings ratio of 11.42x. This compares favorably to the sector median P/E ratio of 17.13x.\n\nPassive-income investors should conduct their due diligence on Magna International. That\u2019s because the company offers a forward annual dividend yield of 3.58%, which easily beats the cyclical sector average dividend yield of around 1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMagna International Stock: Who Says You Can\u2019t Have It All?\n\nSales and earnings growth? Check. A good value? Check. Generous dividend distributions? Check. Unless I\u2019m missing something, it sure sounds like Magna International offers a complete package for investors.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the icing on the cake as Magna International teams up with General Motors and Wipro. If all of this isn\u2019t enough for you, then maybe you\u2019re just asking for too much. So, stop waiting and hesitating, and go get yourself some Magna International stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Tesla Speeds Cheaper EV Plans, Calming Fears Over Strategy",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. shares rebounded after Elon Musk vowed to launch less-expensive vehicles as soon as late this year, easing concerns about disappointing earnings results and diminished growth prospects.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTaylor Swift Is Proof That How We Critique Music Is Broken Biden\u2019s New Chopper Is Demoted After Scorching White House Lawn Tech Giants Roar as Tesla Spikes in Late Hours: Markets Wrap Billionaire Pinaults Fight to Pull Gucci Off the Discount Rack Ray Dalio\u2019s Famous Trade Is Sputtering, Investors Bailing\n\nThe automaker said Tuesday it\u2019s accelerating new models using aspects of a next-generation platform that had been slated for production in the second half of next year. The vehicles will be built on the same manufacturing lines as Tesla\u2019s current lineup and be ready by early 2025, if not before year-end, the chief executive officer said.\n\nThe change of plans sent Tesla shares soaring outside normal trading hours, overshadowing falling vehicle sales, worse-than-expected revenue and profit, and the company burning through more than $2.5 billion cash in a single quarter. Musk had spooked investors in the weeks leading up to the report by signaling self-driving vehicles had taken precedence over bringing a $25,000 car to market.\n\n\u201cWhat matters is investors have some spark of hope that growth will re-accelerate next year,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. \u201cFor the believers, he gave them enough to continue to stay the course.\u201d\n\nTesla shares climbed 10% as of 4:55 a.m. Wednesday in New York, before the start of regular trading. The stock has been the worst performer in the S&P 500 Index this year, plunging 42% through Tuesday\u2019s close.\n\nRead More: Tesla\u2019s Musk Warns Wall Street Autonomous Future Is Main Goal\n\nIn a call with analysts, Musk took a dig at carmakers that have pared EV production plans and pivoted to more gas-electric hybrids. While he didn\u2019t refer to any manufacturers by name, General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. are among the manufacturers that have announced such a shift in recent months.\n\n\u201cThe EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto manufactures are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not the right strategy.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s own strategy has been muddled of late. It\u2019s spent more than a year slashing prices across the lineup in an effort to boost sales. Instead, growth in vehicle deliveries slowed last year, then gave way to a surprise 8.5% drop in the first quarter, when the company built 46,561 more cars than it sold.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors have been unsettled this month by reports that Musk has abandoned a $25,000 model at the expense of his high-risk pursuit of fully autonomous cars. The CEO demurred when asked during the earnings call whether a vehicle at that price point is still planned, saying only that there will be more to share when Tesla shows a dedicated robotaxi in August.\n\nBloomberg reported earlier this week that a next-generation vehicle project had morphed into an effort to wring cost reductions out of components and production methods, then apply those innovations to cheaper iterations of the Model Y and Model 3, the company\u2019s two most popular EVs.\n\nMusk said Tuesday that the new vehicles Tesla is accelerating \u201cwill use aspects of the next-generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup.\u201d\n\nThe new plan isn\u2019t contingent on any new factory or production lines and should eventually enable Tesla to get to more than 3 million vehicles of production capacity, Musk said. The company said in its earnings presentation that its current installed capacity is more than 2.35 million.\n\nTesla will continue work on a new module-based \u201cunboxed\u201d manufacturing process for the dedicated robotaxi Musk teased earlier this month. The CEO referred to it on the call as as the Cybercab.\n\nWhile Tesla remains the dominant EV maker in the US market, its financial performance has sagged for several quarters. Adjusted earnings per share fell to 45 cents in the first three months of the year, short of Wall Street\u2019s expectation for 52 cents a share. Revenue dropped almost 9% to $21.3 billion, roughly in line with its first year-over-year drop in deliveries since 2020. This also was short of the $22.3 billion analysts were expecting.\n\nTesla\u2019s vehicle inventory swelled to 28 days, nearly double the 15 days at the end of the last quarter. The metric captures how long it takes for a car company to move vehicles off its lots.\n\n\u201cWe expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive\u201d territory, Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja told investors on the call.\n\nThe Austin-based EV maker kept its near-term growth expectations in check, saying growth in vehicle deliveries may be \u201cnotably lower\u201d than last year.\n\nTesla initiated its biggest-ever round of layoffs last week, announcing plans for a more than 10% cut to headcount. Bloomberg has reported Musk has pushed for a 20% reduction. Two senior executives announced they were leaving in the midst of the restructuring. Another prominent manager, Tesla\u2019s head of investor relations, Martin Viecha, said on Tuesday\u2019s call he is resigning.\n\n--With assistance from Max Chafkin and Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates with premarket trading in the fifth paragraph.

        "content": "Revenue: Grew by 8% to $43 billion, driven by higher wholesale volumes in North America. Net Income: Not specifically mentioned, but related metrics such as EBIT adjusted and EPS are provided. EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes): Achieved $3.9 billion, with a 9.0% EBIT-adjusted margin. Earnings Per Share (EPS): Reported at $2.62 diluted adjusted. Free Cash Flow: Adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.1 billion, showing significant improvement from the previous year. Gross Margin: North America delivered Q1 EBIT-adjusted margins of 10.6%. Market Capitalization: Not directly mentioned, but share repurchase details suggest strong market activity. Same-Store Sales: Not applicable as GM does not operate retail stores. Store Locations: Not applicable, but production and sales facilities details provided in context of new launches and EV production.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with GM.\n\nRelease Date: April 23, 2024\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: What are the key assumptions in the EV margin outlook for positive contribution margins this year and positive overall margins next year? A: (Paul A. Jacobson - Executive VP & CFO) The improvement is primarily driven by scale benefits, which account for about 60% of the 60 basis point improvement expected. The remainder is split between trims, launches, and material cost reductions. The company has seen significant reductions in battery costs, contributing to a $12,000 year-over-year cost reduction in the LYRIQ model.\n\nQ: Can GM maintain its EV production targets if consumer demand does not meet expectations? A: (Mary T. Barra - Chairman & CEO) GM will not build vehicles just to meet production numbers. The company aims to be responsive to customer demand but believes it will achieve its target range of 200,000 to 300,000 EVs based on the strength of its product lineup. GM has the flexibility to adjust production as needed, including the capability to build both ICE and EVs in the same plants.\n\nQ: How is GM addressing the competitive EV pricing environment, and are further price adjustments anticipated? A: (Paul A. Jacobson - Executive VP & CFO) GM has observed strong retail demand for its EVs, despite overall softness in fleet sales. The company has adjusted EV pricing, which has been well received, and does not anticipate further pricing actions to achieve its sales targets. GM's EVs offer competitive design, performance, range, and value, which are expected to support sales volumes.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ: What is GM's strategy for the Chinese market given the increased competition and shift towards EVs? A: (Mary T. Barra - Chairman & CEO) GM is committed to the Chinese market and plans to introduce several new NEVs and PHEVs. The company is repositioning existing models and launching new ones, such as the Cadillac OPTIQ and Chevrolet Equinox PHEV. GM aims to leverage its global and local solutions to maintain a competitive presence in China.\n\nQ: What are the financial expectations for GM's China operations given the current challenges? A: (Paul A. Jacobson - Executive VP & CFO) GM expects its China operations to return to profitability in the second quarter and maintain profitability for the remainder of the year. The company is managing production to balance dealer inventory levels and focusing on cost efficiencies.\n\nQ: How does GM view its position and strategy regarding competition from Chinese automakers in global markets? A: (Mary T. Barra - Chairman & CEO) GM aims to compete based on the strength of its products and believes in a level playing field. The company focuses on delivering vehicles with great design, features, and value. GM is also enhancing its software and digital capabilities in China to improve competitiveness.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Decoding General Motors Co (GM): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) showcases robust financial performance with increased net sales and revenue. GM's strategic focus on electric vehicles and autonomous driving technology positions it for future growth. Despite strengths, GM faces challenges in the competitive automotive market and regulatory environment. Opportunities in emerging markets and technological advancements could propel GM's market position.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with GM.\n\nOn April 23, 2024, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) filed its 10-Q report, revealing a financial landscape that investors and stakeholders keenly anticipate. This SWOT analysis delves into the intricacies of the filing, offering a comprehensive view of GM's financial health and strategic positioning. The first quarter of 2024 saw GM's net sales and revenue climb to $43.014 billion, a significant increase from the $39.985 billion reported in the same period of the previous year. Net income attributable to stockholders also rose to $2.980 billion, up from $2.395 billion, with basic earnings per share jumping from $1.70 to $2.57. These figures underscore GM's financial resilience and set the stage for a detailed SWOT analysis. Decoding General Motors Co (GM): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nMarket Share Leadership: GM's ability to reclaim its position as the U.S. market share leader in 2022, with a share of 16.5% in 2023, is a testament to its enduring brand strength and competitive product lineup. This leadership is underpinned by a series of strategic decisions, including the consolidation of its brand portfolio in the U.S. from eight to four, which has allowed for a more focused and efficient market approach. The company's financial performance, as evidenced by the recent 10-Q filing, further solidifies its market position, with a notable increase in net sales and revenue.\n\nFinancial Services Arm: GM Financial, the company's captive finance arm, has become a significant strength for GM, contributing to its overall profitability. The recent financial statements show a revenue increase for GM Financial from $3.339 billion to $3.802 billion year-over-year. This division not only supports vehicle sales by providing financing options to customers but also generates substantial income, enhancing GM's financial stability and providing a buffer against market fluctuations.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOperational Disruptions: GM's operational challenges, particularly the cessation of driverless geofenced AV robotaxi services by its Cruise autonomous vehicle arm after an accident in late 2023, reflect a weakness in executing cutting-edge technology initiatives. While plans to restart services in 2024 are underway, this setback highlights the risks associated with the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles. The incident may also have implications for consumer trust and regulatory scrutiny, potentially delaying GM's progress in this innovative domain.\n\nStory continues\n\nGlobal Market Pressures: The 10-Q filing reveals pressures in international markets, particularly in China, where GM experienced a decrease in vehicle sales and market share. The equity loss of $0.1 billion from its Automotive China JVs indicates challenges in balancing dealer inventory levels and adapting to the competitive landscape, including the growing acceptance of domestic brands and demand for New Energy Vehicles (NEVs).\n\nOpportunities\n\nElectric Vehicle (EV) Expansion: GM's commitment to an all-electric future presents significant opportunities, especially as global demand for EVs continues to surge. The company's planned investments in battery cell manufacturing joint ventures and the development of new EV models under its various brands position it to capitalize on this trend. The financial strength demonstrated in the 10-Q filing supports GM's ability to fund these strategic initiatives, which are crucial for long-term growth and competitiveness.\n\nTechnological Advancements: GM's focus on software-enabled services and subscriptions, as well as its investment in autonomous vehicle technology through Cruise, opens up new revenue streams and market differentiation. The potential restart of Cruise's AV services in 2024, coupled with GM's ongoing R&D efforts, could place the company at the forefront of the automotive industry's technological transformation.\n\nThreats\n\nCompetitive Landscape: The automotive industry is characterized by intense competition, with players continuously innovating and expanding their product offerings. GM's competitors, including emerging EV manufacturers and established global automakers, are also aggressively pursuing the EV and autonomous driving markets. This competitive pressure requires GM to maintain a high level of innovation and market responsiveness to retain its leadership position.\n\nRegulatory Risks: GM operates in a highly regulated industry, with stringent environmental, safety, and trade regulations. Changes in regulatory policies, particularly in key markets like the U.S. and China, could impact GM's operations and cost structure. The ongoing investigations related to Opel, a former subsidiary, also present potential legal and financial risks that could affect GM's reputation and financial health.\n\nIn conclusion, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) exhibits a robust financial foundation and strategic foresight, with its leadership in market share and the growth of its financial services arm. However, operational challenges and global market pressures underscore areas for improvement. Opportunities in EV expansion and technological advancements offer promising avenues for growth, while the competitive landscape and regulatory risks pose ongoing threats. GM's ability to navigate these dynamics will be critical in shaping its future trajectory.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, April 23, 2024. \r\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAshish Kohli\n\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. \r\nJoining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. \r\nOn today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the safe harbor statement on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language. \r\nAnd with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nThanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. In January, we outlined clear priorities for 2024 that are designed to build on our strength and learn from the challenges we faced in 2023. I'm very pleased to share that the team is executing well against all of them. \r\nAround the world, we are very focused on growth and profitability, which means taking full advantage of our winning product portfolio to grow share without chasing unprofitable business. \r\nIn North America, the fundamental strengths of Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac truly stand out. The team delivered a 10.6% EBIT margin in the quarter, thanks to our industry-leading full-size pickups, the momentum we're building in midsize pickups, the growth we are seeing in our SUV business, profit improvement in our EV portfolio and our overall operating discipline. \r\nWe again grew retail shares and market share in the U.S. during the quarter with incentives that remained well below the industry average, especially in our truck business. We grew our combined Chevrolet and GMC full-size pickup sales by 3% year-over-year and grew our retail market share 1.8 points to 43.8%, with much lower incentives than our closest competitors whose sales were down. \r\nIn March, we doubled sales of the GMC Canyon year-over-year. And the Chevrolet Colorado were the fastest-growing truck in the midsize pickup segment, thanks to its purity of function, simple elegance and execution and value. Those are MotorTrend's words, not mine. \r\nWe also continue to gain market share and grow EBIT with our new small SUVs, including the Chevrolet Trax and the Buick Envista. These vehicles are helping us win new customers, and we will continue to excel at customer retention. \r\nDuring the quarter, S&P Global Mobility announced that GM has now had the highest loyalty of any OEM for 9 consecutive years. That's a powerful competitive advantage. \r\nIn our EV business, we are building momentum in production and profitability. For example, we have increased battery module production by 300% over the last 6 months. Quality is very good and continuing to improve. And the installation and validation of our new high-speed module assembly lines is on track. We are projecting to double our current capacity by the end of the summer. \r\nEV production rose sharply during the quarter, and our dealers translated that into a 21% year-over-year increase in EV retail customer delivery. For example, the Cadillac LYRIQ outsold all of the EVs from European luxury brands in the first quarter. And since mid-March, we are now delivering Chevrolet Blazer EVs with updated and improved software. \r\nAll of our product programs are benefiting from the end-to-end improvements we've made in software, including the increased rigor we have instilled in our quality and validation processes. More importantly, the talented executives and engineers we've hired from the tech industry are raising the bar for software design and execution, which will help us truly differentiate our customer experience and the suite of software-driven products and services we offer. \r\nWe're also making progress at Cruise. The team is back on the road in Phoenix updating mapping, gathering more road information. This is a critical step for validating our improved self-driving system and building upon the more than 5 million driverless miles we've logged before the pause. We are engaging frequently with regulators and stakeholders in building trust as we regain momentum. Safety will remain front and center and will guide our progress. I am pleased with our ICE performance, our progress in EV execution and growth, our new software organization's performance and the steps we're taking to regain momentum at Cruise. \r\nIn addition, I'm very proud of the GM team and all of our stakeholders for really leaning in to keep our momentum going. Their commitment and tenacity helped give us the confidence to raise our full year 2024 EBIT, EPS and automotive adjusted free cash flow guidance. \r\nIn our ICE business, the redesigned Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Chevrolet Equinox are all launching in high-volume segments starting this quarter. So are the Chevrolet Spin and the S10 in South America, and they have higher margins than the outgoing models. \r\nThen this summer, the sunny new Buick Enclave will arrive. It's the first Enclave to offer Super Cruise. Later in the year, we will make important design and technology upgrades to our best-selling GMC Yukon, Chevrolet Tahoe and Chevrolet Suburban full-size SUVs. They include redesigned, tech-focused interiors, safety and security features that include a suite of connected cameras, riding and handling improvements, styling enhancements and more. \r\nMarking our performance team also have the unbelievable Corvette ZR1 coming, and we can't wait to put customers behind the wheel. And we've already begun installing equipment at our Fort Wayne assembly plant to produce our next-generation full-size ICE pickups. \r\nIn our EV business, the Ultium Cell plant, Spring Hill, is shipping sales and scaling production through the year. The Chevrolet Equinox EV will arrive in showrooms this quarter, and we're very excited because it will be the most affordable, long-range EV in the market. It will also offer Super Cruise like all of our Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs on the Ultium platform. We will then introduce more affordable trim series for the Chevrolet Equinox EV, the Blazer EV and the Silverado EV in the second half of the year, which will help grow volume and share. \r\nAlso in the second half of the year, Cadillac will expand its EV lineup to include the OPTIQ and the Escalade IQ. This is important because EV adoption in luxury segments is higher and more resilient than in the broader market. \r\nTwo of our most highly anticipated launches are the GMC Sierra EV Denali and the Chevrolet Silverado EV RST. They are best-in-class in ways that truly matter to truck customers. By optimizing the battery, aerodynamics and other systems, we were able to increase the range of the RST and the Denali by 10% to an estimated 440 miles, which is about 40 miles better than the median range of ICE vehicles on the road today. No EV pickup on the road today even comes close, and it's possible to go even further. \r\nA few weeks ago, 2 road testers took the RST on a drive from Las Vegas to Phoenix. And they drove it like customers do: unpaved and gravel roads, at freeway speeds, at different temperatures, and different elevations. At the end, they managed to travel 460 miles on a single charge. \r\nIt's the same story for towing. One journalist drove a Silverado EV Work Truck and 3 competing battery electric trucks on a 500-mile trip over the Rocky Mountains while towing trailers. It wasn't even a competition. The Silverado EV stopped once to charge, while every other truck had to stop 4 to 5 times. \r\nChevrolet and GMC are also the only pickup brands that allow drivers to tow while using Super Cruise, our hands-free driving technology. This is just one of the several features that uniquely differentiates our products. This is exactly the kind of design and engineering functionality that excites people, motivates them and turns them into customers. \r\nIt's the same formula for Chevrolet and GMC have filed with ICE trucks, and those results speak for themselves. Based on the feedback we're hearing from customers and dealers, the early sales momentum we are seeing, we're confident that continuing to scale EV production is the right move. \r\nWe know that transparency matters in every transformation. So Paul and I will give you regular updates throughout the year, including at our Investor Day we're planning for this fall, as we achieve our EV production, sales and profitability milestones. \r\nAll of these great ICE and EV products were made possible by the investments we made to drive transformation and growth. As a result, our spending was above historic levels for several years. Now that the foundation is largely built and we're starting to see results, our focus has turned back to driving free cash flow through enhanced profitability and capital discipline, finding ways to spend less for the same results and with an unwavering focus on the customer. \r\nYou're already seeing some examples of this. Our winning with simplicity discipline is a great example of how we're improving capital efficiency and lowering costs. \r\nThe next-generation Ultium-based Chevrolet Bolt EV is another. It's a profitable and capital-efficient program that will deliver one of the most affordable electric vehicles around when it arrives in late 2025. There will be many more examples as we move forward. \r\nWith that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Paul to take you through our results and our new higher guidance for the calendar year.\n\nStory continues\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nThank you, Mary, and I appreciate you all joining us this morning. We're off to a good start to the year, and I'd like to thank our team for all their hard work in helping deliver another strong set of financial results. \r\nWe experienced consistent pricing trends during the quarter, below the 2% to 2.5% headwind we built into our full year guidance. For Q1, pricing was down only about $200 million year-over-year driven by demand for our products and a disciplined go-to-market strategy that prioritizes profitability and margins. And so far in April, we've seen pricing remain relatively consistent. \r\nThat said, our comparisons get tougher as we lap price increases taken in Q2 of last year. The U.S. retail industry experienced a slight mix shift away from the full-size truck segment during the quarter. However, we increased our volume and share with lower incentives than our competitors, which speaks to our strong truck franchises and our customer loyalty. \r\nRetail sales were up 6%, while fleet sales decreased more than 20% driven by 2 main factors. First, we encountered some production constraints impacting the timing of fleet deliveries on our commercial van and midsize pickups. We expect to recover most of this volume in the second half of the year. \r\nSecond, we made the strategic decision to produce more retail full-size SUVs compared to last year to satisfy our strong customer demand. Retail sales on our full-size SUVs have a higher trim mix that earned us more revenue per vehicle. We are committed to growing our strong and profitable fleet business, but we'll continue to balance fleet and retail customer demands with a focus on profitability. \r\nWe generated healthy cash flow during the quarter, helping support $600 million of year-to-date open market stock repurchases incremental to the ongoing ASR, retiring another 14 million shares since the beginning of the year. We now have approximately $800 million remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization. \r\nIn addition, we completed the first tranche of the $10 billion ASR last fall, retiring 4 million shares in Q1. Our fully diluted share count at the end of the quarter was 1.16 billion, down 17% from where we were just 1 year ago. Given the strong momentum we've seen thus far and our confidence in the 2024 outlook, we are raising full year guidance to EBIT adjusted in the $12.5 billion to $14.5 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted to the $9 to $10 range and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $8.5 billion to $10.5 billion range. \r\nNow let's get into the Q1 results. We grew total company revenue by 8% to $43 billion driven by higher wholesale volumes in North America. Over the last 24 months, we've achieved consistent revenue growth, resulting in a CAGR of more than 15% over that period. \r\nWe also achieved $3.9 billion in EBIT adjusted, 9.0% EBIT-adjusted margins and $2.62 in EPS diluted adjusted. EBIT adjusted was up year-over-year and well above consensus driven by our continued strong ICE performance, improving EV profitability and our strategic cost actions, mitigating the effect of higher labor costs. \r\nWe achieved adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.1 billion, up materially versus being flat in Q1 of 2023 driven by improved working capital benefits through inventory management and production timing. North America delivered Q1 EBIT-adjusted margins of 10.6%, driving $3.8 billion of EBIT adjusted, up $300 million year-over-year primarily from higher wholesale volumes combined with steady pricing and ongoing cost containment. \r\nDuring the quarter, we continued to benefit from our fixed cost reduction program, realizing an incremental $300 million from lower marketing and engineering spend. Our fixed cost base is at its lowest since Q1 2022. And we are on track to achieve the full $2 billion net of depreciation and amortization by the end of 2024. \r\nDealer inventory levels ended the quarter slightly above our 50- to 60-day end-of-year target at 63 days. However, we believe we are well positioned from an inventory standpoint as we head into a seasonally stronger part of the year and incur a few weeks of planned downtime in Q2 on our full-size pickups to prepare for future launches and to install new equipment. \r\nGM International Q1 EBIT adjusted was breakeven, down $350 million year-over-year. China equity income was a loss of $100 million, down $200 million year-over-year as we lowered production to balance dealer inventory levels. This was slightly better than expected due to a continued focus on cost efficiencies. Having made progress reducing inventory levels, production is normalizing, and we expect to return to profitability in Q2. \r\nEBIT adjusted in GM International excluding China equity income was $100 million, down $150 million year-over-year driven by lower volume in South America and strategic decisions to protect margins. We anticipate new product launches and further cost efficiencies will help drive profitability improvements beginning in Q2. \r\nGM Financial continues to perform well with Q1 EBT adjusted of $700 million, in line with last year and tracking well within the full year $2.5 billion to $3 billion guidance range. They continue to drive portfolio growth and paid a $450 million dividend to GM during the quarter. \r\nCruise expenses were $400 million in the quarter, down from $800 million in Q4 '23, reflecting our cost reduction activities and a more focused operational plan. As Mary mentioned, Cruise is resuming operations in Phoenix, along with testing in simulated environments and on closed courses while they work to earn trust and build partnerships with regulators and customers. We expect full year Cruise expenses to be around $1.7 billion. \r\nLet's move now to one of the most important metrics we're focused on: EV profitability. We continue to see sequential and year-over-year improvements in variable profit and EBIT margins as we benefit from scale, material cost and mix improvements. \r\nSince last year, we have significantly reduced cell costs with a large driver being lower battery raw material costs, especially for lithium. We ramped our first battery JV plant last year. And as they increased production and made other efficiencies, the cost of cells came down significantly. And cell plant #2 in Tennessee is ramping even faster based on the learnings from plant 1 and is expected to reach full installed capacity by the end of the year. \r\nCollectively, these factors are helping improve vehicle profitability. For example, we have seen more than $12,000 of year-over-year cost savings in the LYRIQ alone. As we continue to ramp, we expect to see the benefits from the production tax credit continue to grow and our fixed cost absorption to improve meaningfully. \r\nWe wholesaled 22,000 Ultium-based EVs in Q1, up from less than 2,000 in the first quarter of last year and remain on track to achieve our 200,000 to 300,000 unit production and wholesale volume target for 2024. We will share more on EV profitability as we progress through the year. \r\nI would also like to touch on EV pricing, which we recently adjusted on the 2024 Blazer EV. This action has been well received by our dealers and customers. And as Mary mentioned, the vehicle is gaining momentum. We assume some pricing pressure for both ICE and EVs in our business plan and guidance for 2024, but we continue to work on finding additional offsets through cost performance and other efficiencies. \r\nImportantly, this pricing action doesn't change our expectation to achieve positive variable profit for our EV portfolio in the second half of the year or our mid-single-digit margin target in 2025. We remain confident that when consumers see our new EVs and get a chance to drive them, they will appreciate the unique combination of design, performance, range and value that we offer at multiple price points. And because of our supply chain efforts, customers are well positioned to leverage the $7,500 clean energy consumer purchase tax credit. \r\nIn closing, I want to reiterate our capital allocation framework along with our intention to be much more consistent in how we deploy capital. We are generating strong cash flow, which is funding our EV transformation and growth opportunities. These efforts include investing in future products, transitioning manufacturing capacity to EVs and deploying resources into cutting-edge battery technology. \r\nAt the same time, you've seen us adapt to the dynamic market, particularly for EVs and made bold decisions to be more efficient with our capital spend, something we will continue to do moving forward. \r\nOur balance sheet remains strong. And on shareholder returns, we executed the ASR last November. And the response has been overwhelmingly positive, with GM stock outperforming its peers and being up nearly 50% since the announcement. We have seen about a 1 turn improvement in our P/E multiple since the ASR, but we are still significantly undervalued relative to our historical average as well as our competitors and other industrial companies. \r\nObviously, we're not satisfied and know that we have a lot of work to do on our valuation and remain committed to improving it. As we move forward, we believe the strong cash generated by our ICE portfolio along with improved execution on our EV strategy as well as tangible progress on Cruise will help generate significant returns for all GM stakeholders. \r\nThis concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Joe Spak with UBS.\n\nJoseph Robert Spak\n\nFirst on the guidance, Paul, I just want to understand the pricing assumption. Is it now just 2% to 2.5% negative for the remaining 3 quarters? \r\nAnd then you mentioned a couple of things on mix. So you've got higher EV sales, smaller crossovers. Both of those seem like they should continue through the year. And then I think you also mentioned some potential trim headwinds in pickups. But then on the other hand, you have the EV variable profit turning positive in the second half. \r\nSo I guess I just want to understand a little bit better how those all intersect. And should we actually see some, maybe net improvement in mix as we move through the year?\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nYou're right that at the end of the day, 2% to 2.5% for the rest of the year is in our assumptions. So essentially, what we have done with the guidance has taken the outperformance that we saw in Q1 and built it into the full year. So really not much has changed on the assumption going forward. \r\nSo when you look at seasonality and you look at trend lines, keep in mind, in the second half of the year, we've got more EV volume coming in. And also we've got some of those pricing headwinds that we've built in. So we feel like this was a good move to go ahead and take it up from where we are. But we're still sort of guided by the same principles as when we put out our initial guidance for the year going forward. \r\nSo as far as mix goes, we've talked about that a lot. We've obviously been trending fairly strong. We are lapping some price increases that we took last year. So as I said, the year-over-year comps get a little bit more difficult. \r\nBut overall, I think the market is holding up fairly well. And as we said before, if we see pricing continuing with this momentum, we expect that we'd be in a position to take up guidance again.\n\nJoseph Robert Spak\n\nOkay. As a second question just on Cruise, with the relaunch, I understand the manually operated and mapping. But Mary, you emphasized an improved system. So maybe you could just give us a little bit more color on how much of the existing technology stack is really sort of being leveraged and what's been redone. \r\nAnd then just on the financial side, does the guidance assume any further steps towards that relaunch? And what about capital need with the cash bounce down to $700 million?\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nSure. Well, first, Cruise, we're very excited that they're back on the roads in Phoenix. As we said, it is manual, but then we'll progress to supervised and then to unsupervised. \r\nAnd the core tech stack, what we've been doing since we made the decision to pause is continuing to work and improving it. So we've actually strengthened the safety of the system by continuing to make sure we comprehend, I would say, a low probability but higher severity type issues. \r\nBecause what we recognized in October although I think mainly it was an issue of not having built the right relationship with the regulatory agencies at all levels as well as the public and then being transparent, but we also realized even though we demonstrated and externally validated that the technology was safer than an average human driver, we need to do more. \r\nAnd so that's what we've been focused on. That's why we're -- as we're going back to Phoenix, we're making sure we're up to date. But very excited about where we are in the technology and very much believe in it. \r\nFor what we plan to do this year of getting back on the road and demonstrating that the model works in one city, as I've said in the past and then expanding from there, we believe it's comprehended in the budget that we have. \r\nAnd then as you look at how we plan to fund the business, we're exploring quite a few options right now, including potentially outside -- taking outside investments as well. And so we'll have more to say about that as we move through the year. But I'm very excited to be back on the road. \r\nWe believe in the technology. We're making it even better. That didn't stop through this whole period since last October.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nJust 2 questions for me. Maybe first for Paul. Just can you remind us how we should think about the volume mix of your new and refreshed ICE crossovers that the next couple of quarters and how you're thinking about the prior margin improvement targets that you spoke about, I think it was last quarter? \r\nAnd then maybe for Mary, hopefully kind of go back to the software strategy and maybe tell us some of the goals that we should be expecting for software and the Ultifi platform over the next 6 to 12 months?\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nThanks for the question. On our crossover, as we've talked about the new Chevy Trax and Buick Envista, both of which are significantly improved from their prior profitability of the -- before the upgrades. And we've seen, particularly the Chevy Trax, really take off. Sales were up 500% in the quarter, and it's really performing well for us. \r\nSo some of the trends in average transaction prices, I think, are muddied by the fact that the volume on those crossovers are going up considerably. But we've still seen strength in our truck pricing and our SUV pricing as well. So we continue to think that, that's accretive and additive to the portfolio, and it's built into our strong guidance that we're updating today.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nAnd then as it relates to the software strategy as we move through the year and beyond, first, as Mike stepped back over the past year, though, he did an incredible job of reevaluating and changing our software development process as well as our validation process and brought in an incredibly strong team of probably more than a dozen people at the senior level to really focus on having the right software strategy as we move forward. So I'm very confident. \r\nWe paused at the beginning this year with the Blazer as we saw limited number of consumers had an issue where we've moved past that now. And that's allowed us to strengthen the software of all of our upcoming vehicles. \r\nAnd so the goals for the next couple of months are to launch with quality on time, and we're on a path to do that. And then as we go forward, as the new software goes across multiple vehicles, then that gives us an opportunity to focus more on growing subscriptions and services. But I'm very pleased with where we are, with the team that we have, and the progress they've made. And it's showing in our ability to launch with quality.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.\n\nJohn Joseph Murphy\n\nMary, I just wanted to ask one strategic question on China. At this point, it's really not a moneymaker for you. And there's a lot of, obviously, noise on a geopolitical basis and sort of our relationship or the U.S. relationship with China. \r\nI'm just curious, is it time to really start thinking about strategic alternatives over there to potentially closing or selling the business? How do you kind of think about that in the context of sort of the broader portfolio over the next few years?\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nYes. Just in general, with everything that's happened over the last several years with COVID and then with the supply chain issues around the chip shortage and then just broad supply chain issues, we have worked and really strengthened the resiliency of our supply chain, and we'll continue to do that. \r\nBut over the long term, we're committed to China. We believe that it's a market that, over the medium term, will have substantial growth. We're continuing to draw not only our global solutions, but in some cases, local solutions as we advance our electrification strategy. \r\nRight now, NAVs account for about 30% of GM's total China deliveries and that's from a Q1 perspective. And we're going to build on that through this year because we have an intense NAV launch cadence. From Q2 then moving forward, we have several PHEVs we'll be launching and moving with full EVs as well. \r\nSo we also have established the Durant Guild, and that allows us to focus on some niche segments in China that are premium and more lifestyle-oriented. And for instance, the Tahoe and the Yukon will be available for preorder later this year. \r\nSo we think, clearly, that market has shifted and the landscape has shifted from -- with the capability of the Chinese OEMs. But we still think there's a role in a place for GM to play with luxury premium. And again, as I mentioned, leveraging not only our global solutions but local solutions. So that is our focus, but we've done that while focusing on supply chain resiliency as well.\n\nJohn Joseph Murphy\n\nOkay. And then I just have one quick follow-up on pricing. Saying 2% to 2.5%, I understand is your best estimate right now. But [current] pricing is difficult. So I'm just curious, maybe, Paul, if you could give us sort of a high level how you think about pricing because there's a lot of cross currents. I mean there's EV price cutting, but there seems like there is resilience on the ICE side. \r\nWhen you look at your cap, you're at 100% capacity utilization, which means you're kind of tight on your sort of structural supply. Look at 0- to 6-year old vehicles, they're going to continue to shrink through the next 2 years probably. So like the used vehicle market is going to stay relatively tight. \r\nSo I mean I think people are looking at this dealer inventory and saying, hey, things are getting a little bit toppy. There's risk on pricing. When you look at some of the structural aspects of supply, they're reasonably constrained. And it seems like even in a Tier 2 and 3 supply base, they're constrained and on labor. \r\nI mean I just -- it just seems like its resilience may be with us a little bit longer than people are fearing. I mean the Canyon as well as your vans you said you were short on some stuff that you were getting to fleets that you'll catch up later in the year. \r\nSo there's -- and just all these kind of pockets of shortages that still persist. And it seems like the kind of things going to last for longer than people are fearing. How do you really kind of concoct or come up with that estimate of 2% to 2.5%? And where do you think things will kind of land over the next couple of years?\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nYes. Well, as we've talked about, the 2% to 2.5%, I want to be very clear, is not an expectation. That's an assumption that we've put into the guidance and provided for people to run their models from that standpoint. \r\nBut as we've seen with the first quarter outperformance, we were there. And April is actually holding up quite well for us with ATPs actually trending slightly higher than where they did coming out of the quarter. \r\nSo not really an expectation as much as we've built an assumption in recognizing that there may be some macro headwinds out there. We do know that our comps get tougher as we lap our price increases that we took in the summer of last year. \r\nBut overall, the commercial environment continues to be resilient. And I think this is a very common theme that we've had now for more than a year worth of quarters of -- there's a lot of sort of downward bias, but we're continuing to manage commercially month-to-month and producing in line with demand. And I think with that balance, it's been very favorable for us on both pricing and margins.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.\n\nMark Trevor Delaney\n\nFirst quarter EBIT was strong and annualizing at about $15.5 billion. I think kind of the full year on EBIT is now $12.5 billion to $14.5 billion for the year. So I'm hoping to better understand some of the factors that temper EBIT over the balance of the year compared to the first quarter run rate.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nSo I would say it comes down to a couple of things. One is there's still the assumption in there of the down 2% to 2.5%. And as we scale up EVs and we continue to make progress about getting them to variable profit positive, the margins on those are not as strong as ICE, obviously. \r\nSo we see a little bit of pressure in the back half from that. But overall, we'll remain consistent. And as I've said, if we don't see that pricing softness, I would expect that there's an opportunity to outperform these numbers.\n\nMark Trevor Delaney\n\nThat's helpful, Paul. Another question on EVs and on the pricing topic. The company spoke to good demand and feedback for its EVs, but the broader market has been quite competitive for EV in terms of pricing. \r\nHoping to better understand if you think GM is going to need to take additional pricing actions this year to reach the 200,000 to 300,000 outlook that you have in North America? Or did the demand signals you have from the market suggests you can hit that kind of volumes this year with relatively firm pricing going forward?\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nSure. Well, obviously, the early results here as we're ramping up Ultium are pretty strong with retail sales up about 20% year-over-year despite the fact that the Bolt, which is sunsetting the prior generation, was down about 60% during the quarter. \r\nSo retail demand remained strong. We've obviously seen a lot of softness in fleet, particularly on the rental side for EVs, but we see customers responding. Now these are on admittedly lower volumes as we scale up, but we're building that momentum that I think we need with the products to be able to show consumers what our capabilities are. \r\nWhen you look at the statistics that Mary cited in the script about the range and what's in our earnings deck, you see that the purpose-built EVs are actually better in terms of performance, range, charging speed, towing capabilities, et cetera, than many of the other products that are out there on the market. And I think as consumers continue to see that, we'll be well positioned as EV demands at the retail side continue to trend. So obviously going to watch it closely, but the early indications are strong.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dan Ives with Wedbush.\n\nDaniel Harlan Ives\n\nSo does it -- and for Mary and Paul, does it feel like now the UAW in the rearview mirror, a lot of the EV strategy now coming to fruit that the company is just in a strong position, which is less uncertainty? I mean can you maybe compare today even 6 to 9 months ago internally?\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nNo, I think you make a really good point, Dan. We do -- I feel much better of where we are, as I mentioned. We now have -- we're ramping up, and the module issue is behind us. All the additional lines that we were scaling are all on track. So we feel very good about that. \r\nObviously, we're pleased that we were able to get an agreement with UAW. We continue to work with them on a number of fronts and build the relationship with the new leadership team as they were named pretty close to when we started negotiations last year. So I feel that we're continuing to talk, raise issues with each other and problem solve where we have challenges. I feel much better about that. \r\nAnd as Paul said, we're seeing good progress with our LTM-based EVs because they are purpose-built and they do have -- there's -- customer's not making a trade-off. And we also see the charging infrastructure get better every quarter. So I feel very good about where we are, and I think we've got momentum. \r\nAnd believe me, we have a very aligned team across GM that is going to seize all these opportunities. I would also add, Dan, that I feel very good, as I mentioned earlier, about where we are with software. The work and the talent that is in the company now and the progress that we've made gives me confidence we're going to be in a good position there as well. So from last year to now, much better, much more positive.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from James Picariello with BNP Paribas.\n\nJames Albert Picariello\n\nJust thinking about whole sales growth for the full year. Global volumes were up almost 4% in the quarter. Can you help dimension the impact for this current quarter's full-size pickup downtime? And just what the full -- what the first half versus second half split might look like for the LTM volumes relative to that 200,000 to 300,000 units targeted?\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nWell, I can -- let me just comment on full-size pickups. We have taken -- announced that we have some down weeks so we start installing equipment so we can have a seamless launch as we get to the next model. And we're just going to stay focused on where the customer demand is at. \r\nWe feel we've got really strong products that, as Paul mentioned, we're growing share. We grew share in the first half with strong pricing. So I think that speaks for the strength of our product. \r\nBut we're going to be customer demand, and we're going to make sure that we don't overbuild because I think it's important to manage residuals and to make sure that we're managing our inventory. I think that's one of the things that we've done that allows us to continue to be strong with pricing and with our products. And as it relates to overall wholesale growth, I don't know, Paul, if you want to talk about that from an EV perspective.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nYes. So on the EV growth, obviously, supply is going to increase throughout the year as we ramp to the 200,000 to 300,000 units of production that we've talked about. Spring Hill is coming online in Q -- came online in Q1, and we're ramping up production pretty steadily in the Ultium cell plant 2. \r\nAnd as module production kicks up, we see an exit rate that's significantly greater. Now of course, we're all going to be paced -- we're going to be paced by where the consumer is from that standpoint. Early indications are that the ramp is going well, and we should expect to see that consistently growing throughout the year.\n\nJames Albert Picariello\n\nGot it. And then just to hit on the quarter's China JV losses. Is the expectation to see profitability the remainder of the year? Or could this take another quarter or 2? And then for GMI consolidated, can you just shed any light on the profitability actions that are taking place in South America?\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nYes, sure. So as China -- I think it's progressing as we articulated at the initial guidance range. We did trend slightly better than what we expected, but we foreshadowed the loss in Q1. We do expect that to reverse and be profitable for the rest of the year. And we said results that were similar to slightly down from last year in China. \r\nSo the rest of the year is we'll have to manage it. But like I said, Q1 was a little bit ahead of expectations, but generally in line, so we'll be profitable. \r\nFor the rest of GMI, we had some downtime in South America, in particular. We're watching Argentina fairly closely as we continue to see the reforms that are going on there. But overall, we see that improving from kind of where we were and not overly concerned about that just yet, but that's a market that we're continuing to watch.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. Alex, you may need to unmute your line.\n\nAlexander Eugene Potter\n\nYes. Can you hear me?\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nYes.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nGot you, Alex.\n\nAlexander Eugene Potter\n\nOkay. Very good. So first question on Ultium. You talked to the 200,000 to 300,000 production guidance, which is good to see. But at the same time, you talk about how you're going to use consumer demand as sort of a gating factor. \r\nWould you say that the 200,000 to 300,000, is that something that you're going to stick to sort of come hell or high water and then gauge consumer demand from there? Or is it something that you could slow walk maybe towards midyear, toward the second half if it doesn't seem like the consumer demand is materializing?\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nWe're never going to build -- just build products come hell or high water because the number is out there. We're always going to be responsive to the customer. But we do believe that we're going to be in that $200,000 to $300,000 range with the number of EVs that we have launching off of Ultium. \r\nWe're seeing strength with HUMMER as we're ramping that up. We're seeing strength with LYRIQ, and Blazer is just now ramping up. We've got the Equinox coming, and there's several more. So I think when you look at the fact that these are all going to meet customers exactly with the performance and functionality that they need, we think we're well positioned there. \r\nSo I would also say though as you look across our portfolio, we are well positioned, whether it's ICE or EV from a -- with the strength of our ICE portfolio. So we're well positioned to respond to the customer. \r\nLike I said, we are very focused on making sure that we don't overbuild, that we're able to maintain our price, our margins. And we think we've got the strength. \r\nAnd specifically, if you look at Spring Hill, we can build EV or ICE in that plant. So I think we're well positioned. We think we're going to be in the 200,000 to 300,000 range by customer demand, and we'll just continue to adapt.\n\nAlexander Eugene Potter\n\nOkay. Perfect. And then second, we talked a little bit about competition within China. I'm interested in hearing sort of your updated views on competition from the Chinese outside China. What's, I guess, GM's stance on this? \r\nDo you think protectionism is necessary? Are you more of a free market sort of philosophy from a company standpoint, competing against the Chinese globally, particularly in places like South America? Yes, any comments on China.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nYes. It's a great question. And first of all, I think in general, we want to have our best products. And if there's a level playing field, then it's -- we want to compete based on products. I think you have to look at where is there a level playing field, and what's happening around the world. \r\nBut there's a lot that can happen from a regulatory or a trade perspective, but we're focused on is making sure we have great vehicles at the right price, so what is going to help us, GM maintain its share around the world. \r\nWhen you look at South America, the Chevy brand is incredibly strong. And we're going to continue to focus on having great designs with great product portfolio with the right features and functions, and we're constantly working on taking cost out of the system. So it's a -- there's value there as well. And that's the way we're going to compete around the world. But I think the focus has got to be on a level playing field.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nThis is Bruno on for Rod. I'd like to understand the key assumptions you're making in your EV margin outlook for positive contribution margins this year and positive overall margins next year. Based on the hints you've given us, we think you need to improve contribution margins per EV by like 10,000 to 15,000 in 2025 compared to '23. \r\nI think if I heard correctly, that's about in line with what you're seeing on the LYRIQ year-over-year. But if you could just help us understand the key buckets of lower cost and what's driving that and your underlying assumptions around pricing and costs.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nYes. Thanks for the question. So if you go back to a presentation that we did back in November, we kind of highlighted the road map for 60 points of EBIT improvement in 2024, about 60% of that is driven by scale benefits. \r\nSo if you think about where we are, we've invested a lot into the infrastructure, battery plants and manufacturing facilities, supply chain, et cetera, to ramp up production. So some of our EBIT losses are really driven by the fact that we need to grow into what we've built. \r\nAnd so that's about 60% of that 60 points improvement. The rest is really kind of split evenly between trims and launches and also material cost reductions. So we've gotten off to a good start as we've seen battery raw materials start to come into the cell costs this year. We've done a good job of reducing cell costs. \r\nAnd as we said, the LYRIQ is down $12,000 in cost year-over-year. So that's the type of progress that we expect. And then as we get into 2025, scale becomes a lower driver, and we get into more of material cost reductions in the vehicles that we're producing as they get out of their early years and we start to harness savings in each vehicle line in the second, third year of production, et cetera. \r\nSo there's a pretty good road map there. Pricing, obviously, we're going to continue to watch and see where the market is. As we talked about, what we did on the Blazer was built into our expectations. So we're not changing off of those targets. And we're just a quarter in on the Ultium ramp, but the early indications are positive.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nOkay. And then just stepping back, we wonder if there's multiple paths to the EV losses that are currently being incurred eventually reversing. Specifically if the demand or pricing environment for these EVs is softer than expected, how much flexibility do you have to lower costs in the EV business, including as it relates to battery plans? I think your plans for 160 gigawatt hours eventually over 2 million units. Is there flexibility to rationalize that if the demand differs from your expectations?\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nWell, I think you've seen us take steps before. We had a delay in the Orion plant where we've really kind of taken advantage of some of the slowdown to put improvements into that plant that are going to help us lower the cost that came out of some of the early learnings from production at Factory ZERO and things that we can do going forward. \r\nSo I think you're going to see us be very nimble. And we're trying to build as much flexibility as we can to navigate from here to significantly higher EV adoption going forward. But when you look at our portfolio across both an ICE, EV, it's probably the best portfolio in our history and customers are responding to that. \r\nSo we're going to meet the customer where they are and continue to endeavor to exceed their expectations and really reward them for that loyalty that they have to us going forward. And we think that, that can translate into the EV market as well. But as Mary -- we're going to continue to be guided by demand for our products and our vehicles. And the early indications are that it's going quite well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore.\n\nChristopher Patrick McNally\n\nJust wanted to dive into some of the questions on seasonality, following up to some of Mark's questions prior. Paul, could you talk about the seasonality in wholesale? I think you've talked about full year being up sort of mid-single digits, which would imply somewhere in the low to mid 800,000 range for the rest of the year. But if you could just help us with just a little bit of the cadence, given some of the downtime you mentioned in Q2.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nYes. There was probably a little bit of pull forward from Q1 to Q2, particularly with the trucks as we prep for that downtime and that retooling that's going to happen for a few weeks. But generally, seasonality, we expect to be very similar with Q1 and Q4 being slightly lower than Q2 and Q3. \r\nSo nothing has dramatically changed. But around the edges, maybe a little bit of pull forward from Q2 into Q1. As we look at the second half, I just want to caution that we've got to continue to be guided by the assumption that's in there on pricing, which obviously has a bigger second half impact, given the performance that we've already booked in Q1 and certainly where April is looking right now. And then with the EV volume ratcheting up in the back half, that's where we see a little bit of front half loading in the guidance that we've provided.\n\nChristopher Patrick McNally\n\nPerfect. All makes sense. And then maybe just on the actual production side, should we think of sort of truck T1 production as maybe has [heightened] in Q1? Do we get back to this level in Q4, just looking at the overall yield and inventory build?\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nI think that, obviously, we're going to continue to watch demand where it is. The inventory, while we built in March, we're still -- we came out of the quarter about 63 days of inventory across the system. \r\nSo some of that was intentional knowing that we were going to have this downtime. So once we get through that, I think we could see third quarter production trend a little bit higher, but we're going to be guided by where demand sits.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.\n\nRyan Joseph Brinkman\n\nThanks for all the detail on your planned upcoming BEV launches in the U.S. It does seem likely you will gain share there with the number and attractiveness of the offerings. I'm curious if you have a similarly aggressive EV rollout strategy planned for China, including because it seems your share in China has declined amidst the industry transition there to EVs. \r\nI heard you citing earlier the increased competitiveness of the domestic Chinese automakers as another contributing factor. And there may be still other factors. But would a blitz of new EVs be sufficient do you think at this stage to stabilize the share trend in China? \r\nDo you have such a blitz planned over the next 1 to 2 years? And would that be a pathway to improved financial performance or given some of the recent pricing trends represent maybe more of an investment with the payoff some years further out?\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nYes. I think we do have, I think, some strong NAVs coming in China this year. We're repositioning [LYRIQ]. We've got the Cadillac OPTIQ launch coming. You'll see that at the Beijing Auto Show. And we also have PHEV entries in the Buick GL8 and the Equinox. \r\nAnd then for our ICE vehicles, we do also have like, for instance, a lead with the GL8 and there'll be more upgrades coming there as well. So -- and then on SGM, we're also -- we have a new -- excuse me, new NEV launches as well. \r\nSo I think we're going to be better positioned, and that's just going to continue as we move through this year into next year. And that's why I think we can play in the NEV market, both plug-in hybrids, hybrids and ICE vehicles as well as EVs. And then, as I mentioned, with the Durant Guild in the niche segment. So I think there's a place for GM to play and grow share.\n\nRyan Joseph Brinkman\n\nOkay. Great. And probably question is about the new vehicle operations in China, maybe just highlight some of the attractiveness if it is that you can draw from the installed base of vehicles there, the OnStar, the financing, sales, service, GM good rent, to sort of how do you feel about that element of the China business?\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nWell, you mentioned all of the things that come together to allow us to be successful in the market. But I would say one of the other things is last year, we also established in China dedicated software and digital business organization. And that is going to allow us to continue to improve and compete on a software basis and also on a services basis, along with what we have from a GMF perspective, financing as well as OnStar. So we'll continue to build that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from the line of Tom Narayan with RBC.\n\nGautam Narayan\n\nPaul, just a follow-up on that comment on the EV margin. So 60% of the 60 basis point improvement is coming from scale benefits. So if BEVs were kind of closer, let's say, to the 200,000 versus the 300,000, is that a net negative or positive to overall margins? Presumably BEVs come at lower margins, but if you're selling a few of them, then there's a negative impact from less scale benefit. So just trying to understand that, like how do we think about that volume number into the company's margins.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nYes, what I would say is that, obviously, based on just where we are in the journey, scale matters quite a bit when you build the infrastructure that we have. So certainly, in the short run, lower volume would have a negative effect on that trajectory. \r\nBut I think what we're looking at is kind of breakeven on the variable profit side around low 200,000. So we still are tracking to be able to get that goal. But I look at that as more of a little bit of timing of when we grow into what we've built. \r\nAnd I think from a strategic perspective, growing capacity slightly ahead of adoption to make sure that we can pace and meter ourselves on this journey. Remember, we're playing a 10-, 15-year plus game from that standpoint. So we've built the flexibility in to be able to respond to ebbs and flows. And we're at a phase right now where we've got to grow into that scale we've built. \r\nBut those are all really, really sound investments. And we feel good about where that's going to go in the short to intermediate term. And then we're going to continue to watch that going forward.\n\nGautam Narayan\n\nAnd a quick follow-up. On the battery raws, obviously, we've seen lithium down like something like 80% or since the peaks. Just curious how your contracts work. When -- have we seen the best of that reduction? Or is there -- is kind of a lag where you see the -- is there more benefits to come given the lag in your battery raw mat contracts?\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nSo what I would say is there's still some goodness to come in '24. So while we saw battery costs come down, remember, we exited the year with a pretty sizable inventory of cells as we ramp up our module production. So as a result of that, there's still some historical costs in there from last year. \r\nBut that will flip pretty much, I think, by the time we get to mid-summer. And in the second half of the year, we'll see cells that have much closer to current prices. \r\nAnd then as you look at kind of vertical integration and investment steps that we made, most of that capacity is in 2026 and beyond. There isn't anything that we've done that I would say we regret because we've locked in higher prices, et cetera. Everything that we've done has been done with a portfolio approach to make sure that we get value for our investment either through floors and caps or discounts to market, et cetera. \r\nSo we haven't done anything that would have locked in sort of historically high prices. And that should be a benefit for us as we roll forward into 2026 and beyond.\n\nOperator\n\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra with her closing comments.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nThank you, and thanks, everyone, for your question. As we've talked today, we are making extremely good progress across the board. We're driving revenue growth. We've got great margins, our free cash flow is strong, and that's enabling us to reinvest in the business and our employees. \r\nSo we plan to efficiently invest between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion in capital this year to leverage the strength of not only our ICE business but also grow our EV business profitably. And we're also advancing our software-defined vehicle capability. So I feel very good about the key areas of focus and how we're doing there. \r\nIn addition, we've set aside more than $160 million in profit sharing for the first quarter to recognize the contributions of the manufacturing team members in the U.S., which were significant, both in terms of production volumes and quality. And our shareholders are also benefiting from the progress too, thanks to our improved execution, a higher dividend and the value-enhancing benefits of the ASR we launched in November. We are on track to reduce our shares outstanding to fewer than 1 billion. \r\nSo I can say to everyone with confidence and conviction that our team is very much on point. We're focused, and we're going to do everything in our power to keep this momentum going. 2024 can be a very strong year for GM. So thank you all for your time.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes the conference for today. Thank you for joining. You may disconnect.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tech Giants Roar as Tesla Spikes in Late Hours: Markets Wrap",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A rally in tech heavyweights lifted the broader stock market, with the group\u2019s high-stakes earnings seen by Wall Street investors as a major test of the bull run in equities.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTaylor Swift Is Proof That How We Critique Music Is Broken Tech Giants Roar as Tesla Spikes in Late Hours: Markets Wrap Tesla Stock in \u2018No Man\u2019s Land\u2019 After 43% Rout Ahead of Earnings Biden\u2019s New Chopper Is Demoted After Scorching White House Lawn Ray Dalio\u2019s Famous Trade Is Sputtering, Investors Bailing\n\nIn late hours, Tesla Inc. soared as the electric-vehicle giant said it will accelerate the launch of more-affordable models \u2014 and chief Elon Musk struck an upbeat tone. The stock halted a seven-day plunge that drove it to \u201coversold\u201d levels, climbing alongside other members of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d cohort of megacaps on Tuesday. Texas Instruments Inc. gave a bullish revenue forecast \u2014 a good sign for the chip industry.\n\nTesla Stock Soars on \u2018Not as Bad as Feared\u2019 Results: Street Wrap\n\nAfter notching several record highs this year, equities lost traction in the past few weeks amid signals the Federal Reserve will hold rates higher for longer. The slide made stocks more attractive as it removed market froth, with investors now focused on earnings, according to Citigroup Inc. strategists.\n\n\u201cWe would view the recent pullback as a buying opportunity,\u201d Citi\u2019s Mihir Tirodkar and Beata Manthey said. \u201cBullish positioning has unwound and now looks more neutral, particularly in the US. The current earnings season could refocus investor attention on solid underlying fundamentals.\u201d\n\nThe S&P 500 notched its best back-to-back rally in two months. Nvidia Corp., the poster child of the artificial-intelligence boom, led a surge in chipmakers. United Parcel Service Inc. \u2014 an economic barometer \u2014 reported profit that beat estimates. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. closed at an all-time high.\n\nTreasuries briefly extended gains after a solid $69 billion sale of two-year notes \u2014 but quickly returned to levels seen ahead of the auction \u2014 with 10-year yields little changed.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Mike Wilson said the bar is high for US firms to deliver on earnings, particularly for megacap technology names, which face tough comparisons from the growth they showed last year.\n\nBut more interesting to him will be how shares react to the results.\n\nEquities extended a rebound after a selloff that sent the S&P 500 down over 5% in April through Friday.\n\nThe most-important aspect of the market set-up heading into this week\u2019s earnings was its \u201coversold\u201d condition, according to Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThus, if earnings come in strong over the days ahead, stocks are effectively spring-loaded for a bigger counter-trend rally than we have seen thus far,\u201d he said.\n\nBased on the median and average pullbacks, downside from current levels would be limited to somewhere between 2% to 5% \u2014 which would also correspond to S&P 500 levels where there\u2019s strong technical support, said Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services.\n\n\u201cPullbacks are the admission price to the market,\u201d he noted. \u201cThe weight of the evidence in our work suggests the market\u2019s risk/reward has improved following the recent setback. Therefore, we view the recent pullback as an opportunity for those investors who have excess cash or are underweight equities relative to their target allocations.\u201d\n\nAhead of a busy period of quarterly earnings, Bank of America Corp.\u2019s corporate clients stepped up purchases of their own stock.\n\nBuybacks accelerated in the five-day period through April 19 \u2014 and are tracking above typical seasonal levels for the seventh consecutive week \u2014 quantitative strategists led by Jill Carey Hall wrote Tuesday in note to clients.\n\nBesides Tesla, Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are also due to report earnings this week. And stakes are high.\n\nListen and subscribe to Elon, Inc. on Apple, Spotify, iHeart and the Bloomberg Terminal.\n\nProfits for the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d group \u2014 which also includes Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Nvidia Corp. \u2014 are forecast to rise about 40% in the first quarter from a year ago, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.\n\nThe group of tech megacaps is crucial to the S&P 500 since the companies carry the heaviest weightings in the benchmark. After this year\u2019s advance, valuations have gotten lofty. After the latest selloff, the Magnificent Seven still traded at a combined 31 times forward earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nTo Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management, the group will likely be able to extend its positive performance.\n\n\u201cAfter all, the strong balance sheet characteristics and secure competitive market positions of the Magnificent Seven imply that a significant correction is unlikely, despite their valuations drawing comparisons to the 2000s tech bubble,\u201d she noted.\n\nAnd despite all the macroeconomic fears, tech balance-sheets may shelter the sector from elevated rates, according to BI strategists led by Gina Martin Adams.\n\n\u201cWhile tech stocks have above-average and median duration relative to the rest of the market, the group also carries relatively little debt and maintains a far superior interest-rate coverage ratio to the rest of the index\u2019s sectors,\u201d they noted.\n\n\u201cBig Tech is carrying S&P 500 earnings growth this quarter, but the other 495 companies in the index will have to come into their own starting in the second quarter,\u201d said Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research. \u201cMarkets clearly believe this will occur, which is why large caps have held in fairly well, even as rates and geopolitical risks have risen.\u201d\n\nBrace for more declines in stock markets, warns Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s tactical specialist Scott Rubner.\n\nAnswering a barrage of questions from clients on whether the pullback in stock markets meant enough equity exposure was reduced last week, Rubner said \u201cmy reply is no.\u201d He noted that Goldman clients have been reducing exposure on any uptick in stocks.\n\nGoldman\u2019s trading desk estimates that commodity trading advisers, or CTAs that surf the momentum of asset prices through long and short bets in the futures market, are modeled to sell stocks over the next week, no matter which way markets go.\n\nTo Mark Newton at Fundstrat, the stock rebound doesn\u2019t mean the lows are in \u2014 but they look close \u2014 and breadth looks to have bottomed out.\n\n\u201cTechnology has pulled back to good support, and should stabilize/rally post earnings,\u201d he noted. \u201cValue has taken a temporary lead over growth \u2014 which should prove temporary.\u201d\n\nCorporate Highlights:\n\nVisa Inc. reported a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street predictions as US credit-card spending climbed. Mattel Inc. reported a smaller-than-expected first-quarter loss, benefiting from fast sales of its Hot Wheels miniature cars and lower costs. Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone sales in China fell 19% during the March quarter, according to data from an independent research firm that marked the gadget\u2019s worst performance there since Covid struck around 2020. Spotify Technology SA reported it swung to a profit in the first quarter as the audio-streaming giant boosted subscribers and added new features. PepsiCo Inc. posted stronger-than-expected sales growth thanks to robust demand in its international divisions, while volumes dropped in North America. Halliburton Co., the world\u2019s biggest provider of fracking work, posted its best earnings for a first quarter in a dozen years despite a shrinking business in the shale patch that it said isn\u2019t likely to recover this year. General Motors Co. expects better profit this year after a strong first quarter, as robust truck sales in the US led the automaker to raise 2024 guidance by $500 million. General Electric Co. raised the full-year profit guidance for its aerospace business, driven by an increase in revenue from commercial aircraft engines and services. JetBlue Airways Corp. forecast worse-than-expected sales this quarter, blaming excess flying capacity in the critical Latin America market Philip Morris International Inc. raised its full-year outlook after strong sales of its heated tobacco and nicotine pouch products. Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s first-quarter operating income beat expectations as it delivered more fighter jets and missile systems. Kering SA warned that profit will plunge in the first half of the year as the crisis at Gucci, its biggest brand, deepens.\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.2% as of 4 p.m. New York time The Nasdaq 100 rose 1.5% The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% The MSCI World index rose 1.2%\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.4% The euro rose 0.4% to $1.0702 The British pound rose 0.8% to $1.2449 The Japanese yen was little changed at 154.82 per dollar\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin was little changed at $66,486.04 Ether rose 0.9% to $3,218.9\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined one basis point to 4.60% Germany\u2019s 10-year yield advanced two basis points to 2.50% Britain\u2019s 10-year yield advanced four basis points to 4.24%\n\nCommodities\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.7% to $83.32 a barrel Spot gold fell 0.2% to $2,322.91 an ounce\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\n--With assistance from Sagarika Jaisinghani and Jessica Menton.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hedge Fund Billionaire\u2019s Cash Helped Fund a \u2018Predatory\u2019 Lender How a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation\u2019s Secrets Big Junk Food\u2019s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for Dinner China\u2019s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires Skip the Robotaxi\u2014Tesla Investors Want a Cheap EV\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Time to Buy General Motors (GM) Stock After Strong Q1 Results",
        "content": "While investors anxiously awaited quarterly results from magnificent seven-player Tesla TSLA after market hours on Tuesday, they shouldn\u2019t overlook General Motors GMstock with the company blowing away its Q1 expectations this morning.\n\nSpiking over +4% today, General Motors stock has now soared +25% year to date to top its arch-rival Ford Motor's F +6% with Tesla shares down a greasily -41% amid slower sales growth and a recent recall in its much-anticipated cyber truck.\n\nWith that being said, General Motors raised its EPS guidance and now looks like an ideal time to buy. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQ1 Review\n\nThe highlight of General Motors' first quarter according to CEO Mary Barra was a 10.6% EBIT margin thanks to operating discipline and an industry-leading full-size pickup fleet. This along with momentum in midsize pickups, SUVs, and profitability improvements in General Motors EV portfolio led to net income of $3 billion or $2.62 per share which crushed the Zacks Consensus of $2.08 a share by 26%.\n\nYear over year, Q1 earnings climbed 18% from $2.21 a share in the comparative quarter. Plus, Q1 sales of $43 billion came in 4% better than expected and rose 7% YoY. Furthermore, General Motors has now surpassed its top and bottom line expectations for seven consecutive quarters. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEPS Growth & Guidance\n\nTo the delight of investors and Wall Street alike, General Motors raised its fiscal 2024 EPS outlook to $9.00-$10.00 per share from $8.50-$9.50 a share. Notably, the current Zacks Consensus for General Motors' FY24 EPS is pegged at $9.12 which would represent 19% growth from earnings of $7.68 per share in 2023.\n\nGeneral Motors also raised its guidance in other key areas such as adjusted EBIT, automotive operating cash flow, and adjusted automotive free cash flow. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGM is Still Cheap\n\nDespite the incredible YTD rally in General Motors stock, GM still trades at just 4.7X forward earnings which is a steep discount to the Zacks Automotive-Domestic Industry average of 13.7X and even below Ford\u2019s 6.8X. Plus, over the last 60 days, EPS estimates are nicely up for General Motors\u2019 FY24 and FY25 which supports the notion that GM is cheap. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nGM has largely comprised the components of a value stock but the iconic automaker is starting to convey the return to growth that Wall Street has been waiting for making now an ideal time to invest. To that point, General Motors stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and the Average Zacks Price Target of $50.54 a share still suggests 17% upside from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Detroit automaker also lifted its 2024 guidance fueled by strong\u00a0truck sales in North America.\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nDuring the first three months of the year, GM reported revenue rose\u00a07.6% YoY to\u00a0$43.01 billion, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of $41.92 billion.\u00a0Net income grew 26% to $2.95 billion with adjusted earnings amounting to $2.62 per share, also surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of $2.15. When excluding some dividend payouts, net income attributable to stockholders rose 24.4% to $2.98 billion, or $2.56 per share.\n\nGM\u2019s operations in North America were the star of the Q1 show.\n\nThe division reported adjusted earnings rose 7.4% YoY to $3.84 billion. With increased retail sales and steady pricing of vehicles, the division achieved an adjusted profit margin of 10.6%.\n\nNorth America\u2019s success succeeded to offset the loss from weak divisions.\n\nOn the other hand, GM\u2019s divison in China reported a loss of $106 million, along with $10 million in other international markets. While highly profitable trucks continue to enjoy strong sales.\n\nEV plans remain on track.\n\nThe EV universe was shaken when Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) reported its first YoY global sales drop since the pandemic. Moreover, Tesla also warned a year of slower growth is ahead. GM is among the many automakers that scaled down its EV ambitions.\n\nBut, GM is still aiming for an output in the range between 200,000 and 300,000 EVs this year.\u00a0Moreover, GM forecasted its North American EV business will become profitable in the second half of the year, which would be a major milestone.\n\nOn the back of strong results, GM\u00a0lifted its full-year guidance.\n\nGM previously guided for\u00a02024 adjusted EBIT in the range between $12 billion and $14 billion.\u00a0It now raised its guidance on both ends for half a billion.\u00a0It also raised its\u00a02024 EPS from a previous range between $8.50 and $9.50to a new range between $9.00 and $10.00 per share.\u00a0GM also raised its\u00a0automotive operating cash flow forecast that is now between $18.3 billion and $21.3 billion, while guiding for adjusted automotive free cash flow in the range between $8.5 billion and $10.5 billion.\n\nGM\u2019s first quarter results reflect\u00a0resilience and strength.\n\nDespite\u00a0the increased labor costs from new\u00a0union contracts, higher interest rates its customers are facing when buying cars and its EV business not being profitable yet, GM made more than expected. But when it comes to EVs, tonight will be the night of valuable insights for the industry as Tesla is due to report earnings. Even the mighty Tesla is undoubtedly feeling the pinch from the EV slowdown, along with intensifying competition in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "The EV sector continues to undergo a period of extreme difficulty. EV sales growth is slowing, adoption rates are not as high as they once were, and global demand has weakened severely. All of those factors suggest that investors should purge their portfolios of these\u00a0EV stocks to sell.\n\nIt\u2019s still too far too early to even begin to suggest that the EV experiment has failed. It almost certainly hasn\u2019t. The current state of the industry is well explained by Roger\u2019s Innovation Adoption Curve.\n\nWhile the broader industry will survive, there are many fundamentally weak EV stocks that will not. We will be discussing those weaker performers here. Many of these shares are no-brainer sells. Others are not so obvious.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s take an in-depth look at each of those seven EV stocks to sell.\n\nCanoo (GOEV) Person holding mobile phone with website of US electric vehicle manufacturer Canoo Inc. (GOEV) on screen in front of logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s very easy to take\u00a0 a look at Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV) stock and find a litany of reasons suggesting that it will fail. Let\u2019s start with immediate recent news and then move on to longer term indications.\n\nShares recently dropped by 26% after the company released earnings and very weak sales. The company reported a pre-ebitda loss of $54.6 million on $367,000 in sales. Wall Street had been anticipating 700,000 in sales and investors punished GOEV shares as a result.\n\nThose results are simply a recent indication of a more permanent problem. Canoo is simply a poorly run company overall. Those weaknesses are evidenced by metrics that are almost all very poor relative to its competitors. The company is in clear distress and faces very real risk of bankruptcy in the near term.\n\nAny potential rebound will take years to materialize if the company can somehow unburden itself of continued losses. It\u2019s a much better idea to simply avoid Canoo as it flirts with bankruptcy.\n\nMullen Automotive (MULN) Mullen Automotive (MULN) brand logo. American automotive and electric vehicle manufacturer\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nMullen Automotive (NASDAQ:MULN) continues to attempt to carve out a successful nicheIn the EV van segment. That differentiation is theoretically the soul saving grace for the stock. Realistically, it isn\u2019t going to matter.\n\nThe only important narrative that potential investors should understand is that the company is bound for further dilution. It has remained consistently unable to maintain listing requirements on the Nasdaq. Then it enacts reverse stock splits intended to artificially inflate prices. Instead, those efforts result in dilution. Investors \u2013 at least the wise ones \u2013 realize what\u2019s going on and the stock again moves lower.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what investors should expect from here on out. The company recently announced streamlining efforts intended to reduce costs. Investors would be foolish to believe that mon Automotive suddenly has the capacity to operate well. Recent cost savings announcements are a little more than a marketing ploy. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. It\u2019s too little too late.\n\nThis make it one of those EV stocks to sell.\n\nFisker (FSR) Fisker Automotive (FSRN) is an American Luxury vehicle company. Fisker stock\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nFisker (NYSE:FSR) is a once promising EV stock quickly headed for bankruptcy. I continue to be amazed at the downfall of Fisker. I was among investors who thought that its outsourcing strategy would greatly benefit the company in the long term.\n\nHowever, Fisker\u2019s choice to outsource the production of its Ocean SUV to Magna International (NYSE:MGA) has not resulted in quality vehicles.Those vehicles are facing no less than three separate safety probes from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nReservation cancellations have topped 40,000 overall. The once promising company is now very close to bankruptcy. Shares are currently in the process of being delisted from the New York Stock exchange. Following a full delisting on April 22, shares now trade over the counter. The decline is among the most rapid EV investors have seen yet. I personally would have expected either of the two companies immediately above to fold before Fisker. Nevertheless, avoid Fisker which has lost nearly 100% of its value.\n\nWorkhorse (WKHS) Person holding cellphone with logo of American electric vehicle company Workhorse Group Inc. (WKHS) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWorkhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) is another clearly distressed EV stock that no self-respecting investor should touch.\n\nMy colleague Chris MacDonald highlighted that distress in a recent article. He was quick to point out the fact that Workhorse has added $80 million to its net losses over the past 9 months. Meanwhile, the company has only made $8 million in sales over that period. He also agreed with me that at least two of the three EV stocks covered above are to be sold. That isn\u2019t to imply that we know anything that any other investor doesn\u2019t: these are just plain old weak stocks.\n\nBeyond that, there are quantitative metrics that are also highly suggestive of a real possibility of Crash and Burn types scenario. Workhorse\u2019s Altman Z-score stands at -9.09. Anything below 1.8 is indicative of a distinct possibility of bankruptcy within the next two years. Investors should not be surprised if and when Workhorse fails.\n\nNikola (NKLA) Nikola (NKLA) company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the background, seen on a computer screen through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.com\n\nLet me give you at least two reasons why Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) stock is going to ultimately fail.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first start with that Altman Z-score that we just discussed. Nikola\u2019s score is also negative and currently stands at -4.18.\n\nRemember, anything below 1.8 suggests that a company is at risk of failure within the next 2 years. The example of Fisker shows that such downfalls can occur very rapidly and are highly unpredictable. Anyway, Nikola is clearly at risk based on that measure.\n\nThe other point to note is that Nikola is expected to pursue a reverse stock split in the near future. The company recently filed a proxy statement meaning it intends to suggest the moves at an upcoming shareholder meeting. Reverse stock splits almost always result in dilution for current shareholders.\n\nAs bad as that is, Nikola is also considering Increasing the amount of common stock available for issuance. That will result in earnings being distributed to a greater number of parties overall, further weakening the stock. All in all, this makes it one of those EV stocks to sell.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Closeup photo of red electric vehicle being charged with blue and black charger plugged into charging port. undervalued EV stocks. Top-Rated EV Charging stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Dmytro_Yushchenko\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) stock is at little risk of an absolute crash and burn scenario. The company is one of the best examples of the too-big-to-fail era. I\u2019m not suggesting that it\u2019s headed for a similar fate again. Instead, I just want to know that it is highly unlikely to run to zero unlike other stocks discussed above.\n\nAnyway, General Motors is a weak EV stock. Of course, General Motors is primarily a traditional vehicle manufacturer. The company has made strong efforts to bring EVs into the fold but that has thus far been unsuccessful.\n\nThe point I\u2019m trying to make here is that those efforts are going to continue to harm GM stock moving forward.\n\nLet me also state that I\u2019m generally not a fan of General Motors vehicles. Build quality is not strong. That goes for its internal combustion engine vehicles and its electric vehicles. GM\u2019s Cadillac lyric EVs are being investigated for brake failure issues.\u00a0 The company was also forced to stop selling its Chevy Blazer EV in late 2023 following significant software issues. GM is unlikely to fail. Conversely, it\u2019s also unlikely to thrive on the strength of its EVs.\n\nLucid (LCID) Lucid Air Touring sedan display at the Service Center. Lucid Motors (LCID) is a manufacturer of luxury EV Electric Vehicles.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nLucid (NASDAQ:LCID) is trying to convince stockholders and investors that the EV stock is worthwhile. It isn\u2019t. A bevy of headlines touting Lucid\u2019s recent record sales doesn\u2019t mean much. The company delivered 1,967 vehicles in the most recent quarter. That was slightly more than the 1,932 vehicles it delivered during the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nThe company is still projecting approximately 9,000 vehicle deliveries this year. Lucid delivered fewer than 8,500 vehicles in 2023. Those deliveries resulted in an overall loss of $2.8 billion. Let\u2019s assume Lucid manages to find some efficiencies this year and reduces its losses. Will it matter? Probably not. Lucid will likely produce and deliver a few hundred more vehicles in 2024 than it did in 2023. it\u2019s logical to then assume that the company will again produce losses into the billions.\n\nLucid probably won\u2019t fully fail given the substantial backing it has. However, there\u2019s little reason to believe that it will improve this year and perhaps beyond.\n\nThis concludes my list of EV stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The bottom line also increased from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level of $2.21. Solid results from the GMNA segment led to the outperformance. Revenues of $43.01 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.28 billion and increased from $39.9 billion recorded in the year-ago period.\n\nThe U.S. auto giant recorded adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $3.87 billion, slightly higher than $3.8 billion in the prior-year quarter. The automaker\u2019s share in the GM market was 8.1% in the reported quarter compared with 8.7% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nGeneral Motors Company Price and EPS Surprise General Motors Company Price and EPS Surprise\n\nGeneral Motors Company price-eps-surprise | General Motors Company Quote\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nGM North America (\u201cGMNA\u201d) generated net revenues of $36.1 billion, up from $32.9 billion recorded in the corresponding period of 2023. The figure also outpaced our model projection of $33.5 billion on higher-than-expected deliveries. Wholesale vehicle sales in the GMNA unit totaled 792,000 units, up from 723,000 units reported in the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed our estimate of 718,000 units. The segment\u2019s operating profit totaled $3.84 billion, up from $3.57 billion recorded in the year-earlier period. The metric also exceeded our estimate of $2.75 billion.\n\nGM International's\u00a0(\u201cGMI\u201d) net revenues in the reported quarter amounted to $3.08 billion, down from the year-ago quarter\u2019s $3.72 billion. The metric also missed our estimate of $3.96 billion due to lower-than-expected deliveries. The segment\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales of 104,000 units decreased from 141,000 units in the year-ago quarter and also missed our projection of 148,000 units. GMI reported an operating loss of $10 million against a profit of $347 million generated in the year-ago period due to low equity income. Our estimate was an operating profit of $464.7 million.\n\nGM Financial generated net revenues of $3.81 billion in the quarter, up from $3.34 billion recorded in the year-ago period and ahead of our prediction of $3.48 billion. The segment recorded an EBIT-adjusted operating profit of $737 million, down from $771 million recorded in the year-ago period. The metric surpassed our prediction of $691 million.\n\nGM Cruise recorded net revenues of $25 million in the fourth quarter, flat year over year. The metric came in line with our projection as well. The segment posted an operating loss of $442 million, narrower than a loss of $561 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The reported loss was, however, wider than our estimate of a loss of $358 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancial Position\n\nGeneral Motors had cash and cash equivalents of $17.64 billion as of Mar 31, 2024. The long-term automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $15.9 billion. Net automotive cash provided by operating activities amounted to $3.6 billion during the quarter under review.

The dividend will be paid on Jun 20, 2024, to shareholders of record as of Jun 7, 2024.\n\nRevised 2024 Guidance\n\nFor full-year 2024, GM now expects adjusted EBIT in the range of $12.5-$14.5 billion, up from $12-$14 billion guided earlier. Adjusted EPS is anticipated in the range of $9-$10, up from $8.50-$9.50, guided earlier. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is expected in the band of $8.5-$10.5 billion, higher than the prior forecast of $8-$10 billion.

        "title": "Pre-Markets Up, Q1 Earnings Beats for GM, UPS, Pepsi",
        "content": "Tuesday, April 23rd, 2024\r\n\r\nAs Q1 earnings season rolls along, market outlooks seem sunnier. For one thing, we\u2019re not seeing many bleak, bad misses from companies yet reported; if anything, we\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by results from big Wall Street banks, major manufacturers, etc. We\u2019re just starting to see companies in Tech reporting for calendar Q1, but even there we are \u201cso far, so good.\u201d The Dow is +110 points at this hour, the S&P 500 is +20 and the Nasdaq +75 points. This follows a solid day in the green across the board.\r\n\r\nEconomic prints are coming in slowly this week. After today\u2019s open, we\u2019ll see S&P flash PMI results on both Services and Manufacturing for the month of April. Expectations for both are currently 52.0 \u2014 a slight uptick from the previous 51.7 in Services and 51.9 in Manufacturing a month ago. And importantly, these figures remain north of the 50 threshold, which is the tipping point between gains and losses. Elsewhere, we\u2019ll get New Home Sales for March: expected at 669K from 662K the prior month.\r\n\r\nThe big economic report for the week comes out Friday. This will be the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report for March, which is expected to come in-line with the previous month, slightly up year over year, and slightly down on core year over year. When the Fed talks about not being satisfied that inflation metrics are suitably driven from our economy as of now, it\u2019s the PCE they are most clearly referencing. Fed Chair Jerome Powell himself name-drops PCE data during his Q&A periods following Fed meetings.\r\n\r\nAhead of today\u2019s open, General Motors GM is out with Q1 results. The \u201cBig 3\u201d automaker posted a +26% earnings beat \u2014 $2.62 per share versus $2.08 expected (and $2.21 in the year-ago quarter) \u2014 on a +4.2% top-line outperformance, to $43.01 billion (nicely ahead of the $39.99 billion a year ago). Further, the maker of Chevrolets, Cadillacs and Buicks, etc. has upgraded forward guidance, citing a mixed outlook for its EV offerings. Shares are up +4% on the release, adding to the +20% year to date. For more on GM\u2019s earnings, click here.\r\n\r\nDelivery and logistics giant United Parcel Service UPS posted mixed results for its Q1 this morning. The company estimates by a solid dime on earnings to $1.43 per share, while coming up a tad short on the top line: $21.71 billion versus $21.91 billion in the Zacks consensus. It laid off 12K workers in the quarter as business has softened; competitor FedEx had posted similar results in its most recent earnings report. Even though UPS only has one earnings miss in the past five years, shares are down -1.2%, adding to the -8% year to date.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo PEP, another read on consumer appetite, posted strength on both top and bottom lines before today\u2019s opening bell. Earnings of $1.61 per share outpaced the $1.52 expected (and the $1.50 per share reported a year ago) for a +5.9% beat, while revenues of $18.25 billion narrowly improved over the Zacks consensus by +0.62%. It\u2019s the fourth straight earnings beat, and third revenue beat in the past four quarters in sales. Yet shares are down -0.3% in today\u2019s pre-market, despite its China business improving. For more on PEP\u2019s earnings, click here.\r\n\r\nSpotify SPOT surpassed estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning. Earnings of $1.05 per ADR (Spotify is headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden) easily trounced the 63 cents expected, and is finally turning a profit after years of negative earnings. This amounts to a +66.67% positive surprise, on $3.95 billion in sales, +2.05% from the Zacks consensus and notably improved from $3.26 billion reported a year ago. The stock is ramping up another +7% in the pre-market, +45% year to date and +107% over the past year. For more on SPOT's earnings, click here.\r\n\r\nAfter today\u2019s close, Tesla TSLA comes out with Q1 earnings. Market participants are bracing for one of the worst quarters from the EV leader in recent memory, and the stock continues to carry a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and a Value-Growth-Momentum score of F. We\u2019ll also hear from Visa V and Texas Instruments TXN on earnings after the bell sounds this afternoon.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

The company credited the gains to demand for new offerings such as the Cadillac Lyriq.\n\nIn coming months, GM will debut a $34,995 Chevrolet EV Equinox, and a 440 mile range Silverado EV truck.\n\nAdded Jacobson, \"Retail performance for our EVs is actually holding in there pretty well.

        "title": "GM earnings top forecasts, company raises outlook and sees 'variable profit' in EV unit by year-end",
        "content": "General Motors (GM) kept the earnings momentum going with strong first quarter results on Tuesday, as the automaker upped its full-year guidance and said it still sees \"positive variable profit\" in its EV business in the back half of 2024.\n\nFor the quarter, GM reported top-line revenue of $43.0 billion, more than the $42.09 billion analysts were expecting, according to Bloomberg data. That was a jump of 7% on the same period a year ago and matched the last quarter's $43 billion in sales.\n\nThe company posted adjusted earnings per share of $2.62, above forecasts for $2.12, with adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of $3.9 billion. GM's Q1 operating profit came in at $3.7 billion, topping estimates for $3.12 billion.\n\nGM shares were up nearly 4% in pre-market trade following the release of the results.\n\nGM's strong performance also resulted in the company lifting its 2024 guidance. The company now sees FY adjusted EBIT of $12.5 billion-$14.5 billion, up from an outlook of $12.0 billion-$14.0 billion previously. Adjusted earnings are now expected to come in between $9.00-$10.00 per share in 2024; GM previously saw full-year EPS between $8.50-$9.50.\n\nGM also boosted its automotive operating cash flow outlook to a range of $18.3 billion-$21.3 billion and adjusted automotive free cash flow to $8.5 billion-$10.5 billion.\n\n\"As we continue to strengthen our ICE portfolio, scale EVs and reinvest in the business, we are very focused on capital efficiency, enhancing profitability and free cash flow, and we will continue to take steps to create shareholder value,\" GM CEO Mary Barra said in a shareholder letter.\n\nGM CFO Paul Jacobson said in a media call with reporters that boosting GM's guidance following its \"strong\" first quarter was \"the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nJacobson also added that GM's customers have \"been remarkably resilient in a period of higher interest rates.\"\n\nGM's EV outlook and overall Q1 sales\n\nGM reiterated that it sees \"positive variable profit\" in its EV business in the second half of 2024, tied to a projection of around 200,000 EVs sold through the end of the year.\n\nThe company expects EBIT margin in the EV business to improve by 60 points from 2023 through 2024, and it sees \"mid-single digit EBIT margin\" by 2025, when the effect of clean energy tax credits are included.\n\nGM had previously abandoned its goal of building 400,000 EVs through mid-2024. Jacobson said on the media call that GM will \"pace ourselves with the customer\u201d when it comes to EV sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nBarra wrote in her letter that leveraging the strength of the traditional gas-powered business gave the company the ability to grow its EV business over time, while still \"delivering strong margins and cash flows.\" A GMC vehicle for sale on the Chuck Nash dealership lot in San Marcos, Texas. (Brandon Bell/Getty Images) (Brandon Bell via Getty Images)\n\nGM reported Q1 sales in the US that topped estimates but were lower compared with a year ago thanks to lower fleet sales. GM delivered 594,233 vehicles, down 1.5% year-on-year, while retail sales were up 6%.\n\nGM said it delivered more vehicles than any other automaker in the US during the first quarter.\n\nOn the EV front, GM reported notable gains with the Cadillac LYRIQ, Hummer EV, and the Silverado EV. The Silverado EV was only available to fleet customers, but will begin deliveries to retail customers in \u201cthe coming months,\u201d the company said.\n\nChevrolet\u2019s Blazer EV notched just 500 sales in the quarter, though it only resumed sales in March following a halt in sales due to a software issue. The highly anticipated Equinox EV begins sales later in the second quarter, with prices starting at around $35,000.\n\nBarra said GM is restarting operations at Cruise, its autonomous driving unit, in the Phoenix area where cars are back on the road. Cruise shut down all operations last year following an accident with a pedestrian and other incidents involving its autonomous vehicles.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(b) Equity earnings related to Ultium Cells Holdings LLC, an equally owned joint venture with LG Energy Solution, are presented in Automotive and other cost of sales as this entity is integral to the operations of our business by providing battery cells for our electric vehicles (EVs). Equity earnings related to Ultium Cells Holdings LLC were $156 million and insignificant in the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nGeneral Motors Company and Subsidiaries Supplemental Material1 (Unaudited)\n\nGeneral Motors Company (GM) uses both generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. Our non-GAAP measures include: earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)-adjusted, presented net of noncontrolling interests; earnings before income taxes (EBT)-adjusted for our General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial) segment; earnings per share (EPS)-diluted-adjusted; effective tax rate-adjusted (ETR-adjusted); return on invested capital-adjusted (ROIC-adjusted) and adjusted automotive free cash flow. GM's calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP measures.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve ROIC-adjusted. Management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. Further, our Board of Directors uses certain of these, and other measures, as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. For these reasons, we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful for our investors.\n\nEBIT-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net income attributable to stockholders) EBIT-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share)  EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-diluted less adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Effective tax rate) ETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Return on equity) ROIC-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and\u00a0other postretirement benefits (OPEB) liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.\n\n1 Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding.\n\nThe following table reconciles Net income attributable to stockholders under U.S. GAAP to EBIT-adjusted and segment profit (loss) (dollars in millions):\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 Net income attributable to stockholders(a) $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,980 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,395 Income tax expense (benefit) 762 428 Automotive interest expense 219 234 Automotive interest income  (186) (229) Adjustments Buick dealer strategy(b) 96 99 Voluntary separation program(c) \u2014 875 Total adjustments 96 974 EBIT-adjusted 3,871 3,803 Operating segments  GM North America (GMNA) 3,840 3,576 GM International (GMI) (10) 347 Cruise  (442) (561) GM Financial(d) 737 771 Total operating segments 4,124 4,133 Corporate and eliminations(e) (253) (330) EBIT-adjusted $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,871 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,803\n\n(a) Net of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Wholesale vehicle sales data consists of sales to GM's dealers and distributors as well as sales to the U.S. government and excludes vehicles sold by our joint ventures. Wholesale vehicle sales data correlates to GM's revenue recognized from the sale of vehicles, which is the largest component of Automotive net sales and revenue. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, 26.0% of GM's wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes wholesale vehicle sales by automotive segment (vehicles in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 GMNA 792 723 GMI 104 141 Total 895 864\n\nTotal vehicle sales data represents: (1) retail sales (i.e., sales to consumers who purchase new vehicles from dealers or distributors); (2) fleet sales (i.e., sales to large and small businesses, governments and daily rental car companies); and (3) certain vehicles used by dealers in their business. Total vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint venture. Certain joint venture agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures, which are included in the total vehicle sales we report for China. While total vehicle sales data does not correlate directly to the revenue\u00a0GM recognizes during a particular period, we believe it is indicative of the underlying demand for GM's vehicles. Total vehicle sales data represents management's good faith estimate based on sales reported by our dealers, distributors and joint ventures; commercially available data sources such as registration and insurance data; and internal estimates and forecasts when other data is not available.\n\nThe following table summarizes industry and GM total vehicle sales and GM's\u00a0related competitive position by geographic region (vehicles in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 Industry GM Market\r\nShare Industry GM Market\r\nShare North America United States 3,860 594 15.4\u00a0% 3,682 603 16.4\u00a0% Other 892 115 12.9\u00a0% 793 103 13.0\u00a0% Total North America 4,752 709 14.9\u00a0% 4,475 707 15.8\u00a0% Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa China(a) 5,617 441 7.9\u00a0% 5,103 462 9.1\u00a0% Other 5,500 113 2.0\u00a0% 5,543 108 1.9\u00a0% Total Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa 11,117 554 5.0\u00a0% 10,646 570 5.4\u00a0% South America Brazil 514 57 11.1\u00a0% 471 71 15.1\u00a0% Other 308 27 8.8\u00a0% 382 35 9.1\u00a0% Total South America 823 84 10.2\u00a0% 854 106 12.4\u00a0% Total in GM markets 16,692 1,347 8.1\u00a0% 15,974 1,382 8.7\u00a0% Total Europe 4,294 \u2014 \u2014\u00a0% 4,089 \u2014 \u2014\u00a0% Total Worldwide(b) 20,986 1,348 6.4\u00a0% 20,063 1,383 6.9\u00a0% United States Cars 728 50 6.8\u00a0% 707 61 8.6\u00a0% Trucks 936 291 31.1\u00a0% 996 297 29.8\u00a0% Crossovers 2,196 253 11.5\u00a0% 1,979 246 12.4\u00a0% Total United States 3,860 594 15.4\u00a0% 3,682 603 16.4\u00a0% China(a) SGMS 155 173 SGMW 287 289 Total China 5,617 441 7.9\u00a0% 5,103 462 9.1\u00a0%\n\n(a) Includes sales by the Automotive China JVs: SAIC General Motors Sales Co., Ltd.

        "title": "The Top 3 Battery Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "The demand for batteries has seen a significant surge in recent times, leading to a rise in the valuation of battery stocks. With governments worldwide implementing stricter emissions regulations and consumers increasingly choosing electric over traditional combustion engines, the future for EV battery stocks looks exceptionally bright.\n\nThe electric vehicle battery market is projected to grow significantly from 2024 to 2029. As per Mordor Intelligence, the market could reach $178 billion by 2029, growing at an impressive CAGR of 23.5%. The demand for batteries increased by 65% to 550 GWh in 2022, as per IEA. The rising sales of electric passenger cars, particularly in China and the United States, mainly drive that growth.\n\nAmidst this backdrop, certain EV battery makers stand out for their innovative approaches, strategic partnerships and robust financial performance. These companies are strategically positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand from major automakers. Thus, here are three battery stocks well-positioned to provide solid returns to investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEnovix (ENVX) a group of connected batteries\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWith its innovative approach to lithium-ion batteries, Enovix (NASDAQ:ENVX) is at the forefront of the battery technology industry. The company employs a proprietary 3D silicon cell structure and silicon anodes in its batteries. This technological enhancement leads to a higher energy density and positions Enovix as a leading player in the industry.\n\nThe company reported strong growth in its revenues in Q4 2023, with sales of $7.4 million in the quarter, up from $1.1 million in Q4 2022. The company anticipates starting battery production at its Fab-2 facility in Malaysia in April 2024, indicating a swift move toward commercial-scale manufacturing.\n\nAlthough the stock has not done well in 2024, Wall Street analysts are still bullish on the company and have an average price target of $29.73 on the stock. That translates into a massive 374% potential upside in the near term.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle\u2019s (NYSE:ALB) position as a low-cost lithium producer provides it with a competitive edge in the industry. That advantage is crucial in periods of low lithium prices, as it allows the company to sustain operations more effectively than higher-cost producers.\n\nIn 2023, Albemarle experienced a tumultuous period characterized by fluctuating lithium prices. The impact was notably reflected in its Q4 earnings, where revenue declined by 10% year-over-year (YoY), attributed to the stark decrease in lithium prices. In response to the challenging market environment, Albemarle has strategically adjusted its capital expenditure and operational strategies.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlbemarle\u2019s management remains optimistic about the long-term demand for lithium, projecting significant growth driven by the global shift towards electric vehicles. The company anticipates a demand surge that could nearly triple by 2030, reinforcing the strategic importance of maintaining a strong position in the lithium market.\n\nALB\u2019s stock is down 22% in 2024. However, Wall Street analysts remain bullish on the stock and have an average price target of $149.34 on the stock. That provides a near-term potential upside of 33%.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) stands out with its Thacker Pass project, poised to become a critical asset in the North American lithium market. The project has gained strategic importance due to its scale and location in the United States. The U.S. is keen on bolstering domestic supply chains for critical minerals.\n\nLithium Americas has demonstrated prudent financial management amidst challenging market conditions. The company has secured a conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy for a loan of $2.26 billion. That underscores government support and confidence in the project\u2019s viability and strategic relevance. That financing is pivotal in ensuring the project\u2019s completion without financial strain on the company\u2019s resources.\n\nThe strategic partnership with General Motors (NYSE:GM), which includes a commitment to purchase significant quantities of lithium, provides additional financial stability and revenue visibility.\n\nAlthough LAC\u2019s stock is down 26% in 2024, Wall Street analysts are currently bullish on the company, giving the stock an average price target of $10.21. That provides a potential upside of 116% in the near term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohammed Saqib did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMohammed Saqib is a research analyst with experience in equity research and financial modeling.

        "title": "GM earnings preview: Updated guidance, EV-hybrid rollout in focus",
        "content": "Following a strong 2023 and positive retail sales growth in 2024, GM (GM) investors are counting on the Big Three automaker to keep the earnings momentum going with Q1 results on tap for Tuesday morning.\n\nFor the quarter, GM is expected to report top-line revenue of $42.09 billion (per Bloomberg consensus), a jump of 5% versus a year ago but below last quarter\u2019s $43 billion in sales. In terms of profits, the Street is looking for GM to earn $2.12 in adjusted earnings per share, translating to an adjusted net income of $2.42 billion, with operating profit coming in at $3.12 billion.\n\nThough revenue is expected to rise 5%, GM\u2019s adjusted net income could slide by nearly 22%, as higher labor costs from its new labor deal with the United Auto Workers (UAW), weak international sales (especially in China), and costs from its EV business may take a bite out of profits.\n\nThough its EV sales were improving in 2024, GM had to take a $1.7 billion hit for losses relating to existing EV inventory in Q4.\n\nInvestors will be keen to see if there are any updates to GM\u2019s 2024 outlook. Earlier this year, GM forecast $12 billion to $14 billion adjusted EBIT for 2024, with the automaker also seeing $8.50 to $9.50 in adjusted EPS for the year.\n\n\"We believe GM could raise guidance as soon as this quarter, given stronger pricing for longer than assumed,\" Deutsche Bank's Emmanuel Rosner wrote to clients early last week.\n\nAs for deliveries in the quarter, GM reported Q1 sales in the US that topped estimates but were down compared to a year ago due to lower fleet sales. GM delivered 594,233 vehicles, down 1.5% compared to a year ago; however, retail sales were up 6%. GM also said it delivered more vehicles than any other automaker in the US in Q1.\n\nDigging deeper into GM\u2019s EV sales, the company reported big gains with the Cadillac LYRIQ, Hummer EV, and the Silverado EV. The Silverado EV was only available to fleet customers but will begin deliveries to retail customers in \u201cthe coming months,\u201d GM said.\n\nChevrolet\u2019s Blazer EV notched just 500 sales in the quarter, though it only resumed sales in March following stopped sales due to a software issue. Looking ahead, the highly anticipated Equinox EV begins sales later in Q2; GM said the Equinox EV will start around $35,000.\n\nGM and other legacy automakers' ability to leverage traditional gas powertrain vehicle sales has allowed those companies to weather the current EV demand slump affecting bigger EV names with only minimal overall sales losses.\n\nMissing from GM's rollout has been hybrids, which have been gaining in popularity recently. GM said in its Q4 earnings call that it will roll out plug-in hybrid tech to some of its vehicles in North America.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier this year GM CFO Paul Jacobson also reiterated the company's goal for EV profitability in a roundtable call with reporters. \"We won't get to low-to-single-digit profitability [EBIT EV margin] until 2025,\" he said.\n\nGM, which abandoned its goal of building 400,000 EVs through mid-2024, did not say whether it still expects to have 1 million units of EV capacity by 2025.\n\nFinally, investors will be seeking new updates on GM\u2019s autonomous driving unit, Cruise. The unit shut down all operations last year following an accident with a pedestrian and other incidents involving its vehicles. After a management shake-up, Cruise is rumored to be restarting operations in Phoenix featuring vehicles with human co-pilots.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "General Motors GM is slated to release first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 23, before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings and revenues is pegged at $2.06 per share and $40.61 billion, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors\u2019 first-quarter earnings per share has been revised upward by 4 cents in the past 30 days. The bottom-line projection indicates a year-over-year decline of 6.79%.

The year-over-year retail sales of Buick, Chevrolet, Cadillac and GMC rose 10%, 6%, 9% and 3%, respectively, while that of GM envolve declined 23%.

        "title": "Full Speed Ahead: 3 Transportation Stocks Picks Delivering Stellar Returns",
        "content": "Given the current, strong state of the macro economy, many transportation stocks have performed very well in recent months. And that trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. On the consumer side, the strong labor market has resulted in continued, powerful travel trends. Plus, with Washington spending a great deal of money on infrastructure, a high number of truck makers and railroad firms have done very well. Automakers are also doing relatively well because of consumer strength, and the fact that most of the names in the sector were priced for a recession that never arrived. Moreover, given the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s clear desire to still cut interest rates later this year, lower rates should boost the auto sector at some point. Lets take a look at three transportation stocks that are likely to boost your portfolio.\n\nGreenbrier (GBX) The Greenbrier Companies (GBX)logo on the website homepage\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nI\u2019ve long been bullish on train equipment company Greenbrier (NYSE:GBX). Mainly due to the firm\u2019s leverage to the factory building trend in the U.S., and Washington\u2019s high infrastructure spending.\n\nOf course, a great deal of material is needed to build factories, and freight trains are used to haul many of these commodities. Moreover, the bipartisan infrastructure law includes a huge $66 billion for the railroad sector. GBX is getting a lift from those expenditures.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn light of these points, I\u2019m not surprised that GBX has jumped 17% in the last three months and 74% in the last 12 months.\n\nThe company reported much better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results on April 5 as its EPS came in at $1.03, versus analysts\u2019 average estimate of 90 cents. Meanwhile, it generated revenue of $863 million, compared with $842 million.\n\nAmerican Airlines (AAL) American Airlines plane on ramp in Chicago Airport. American Airlines is amongst the airlines cancelling flights\n\nSource: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Airlines (NYSE:AAL) reported strong first-quarter results on April 18, which showed that it\u2019s benefiting tremendously from the travel boom. Specifically, its operating revenue climbed 10% versus the same period a year earlier to $12.5 billion. And its free cash flow advanced to $1.48 billion from $1.3 billion in Q1 of 2022.\n\nAlso impressive is that its total revenue per available seat mile increased 0.6% year-over-year while its cost per available seat mile dropped 0.6% YOY. The data suggests that the firm\u2019s profitability is indeed headed higher.\n\nWhile higher oil prices could threaten the latter dynamic, oil prices have trended downward in recent days as the chances of a direct Iran-Israel war fade. Further, I believe that oil prices\u2019 fundamentals are poor due to the electrification of transportation.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Cadillac car and SUV dealership.

GM stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) stock advanced 20% over the\u00a0three months that ended on April 18. Among the positive catalysts for GM stock were the company\u2019s decision in November to institute a record $10 billion buyback. Another was the increase of its dividend by 33% to 12 cents per share. Additionally, the automaker pleased the Street by cutting its annual costs by $2 billion.\n\nWall Street analysts have generally been upbeat on GM stock recently. For example,\u00a0Deutsche Bank predicted that the firm \u201ccould report a particularly solid beat\u201d when it delivers its Q1 results.\n\nAlso bullish on GM was\u00a0UBS which identified GM as one of its favorite names transportation stocks. Finally, Morgan Stanley in has also made GM one of its top picks. In March, it upgraded the Auto sector to \u201cattractive\u201d from \u201cin-line.\u201d The bank expects automakers to benefit from its reduced spending this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "General Motors And Ford Are Facing The Same Challenge As They Run Back To Gas-Powered Trucks\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F) will report their first quarter results next week. They both need to answer how they intend to grow their profits amid the EV slowdown to which even the EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), isn\u2019t immune. Tesla warned of slower growth this year. With the EV sales slump, Tesla shares tumbled as much as 39% year to date. Along with growing competition in China, Tesla has also found itself in the mud, let alone legacy automakers struggling to make their biggest ever transformation for the all-electric era that is still coming, just not as fast.\n\nGM\n\nGM is yet to outline its strategy for restructuring its business in China.\u00a0Last year, GM delivered\u00a02.1 million vehicles\u00a0in the world\u2019s greatest EV market. Besides the restructuring, GM also needs to address its struggling Cruise Robotaxi division. But when it comes to seeing consistent profitability, GM\u00a0is expected to report\u00a0strong sales of its Chevrolet and GMC trucks, along with\u00a0SUVs.\n\nFord\n\nFord,is getting its\u00a0power from combustion trucks, along with its\u00a0Ford Pro commercial vehicles.\u00a0Ford did affirm its core profit guidance for the year to be in the range between\u00a0$10 billion\u00a0and\u00a0$12 billion.\n\nLast year, Ford\u00a0lost nearly $4.7 billion\u00a0EVs. This year, it forecasted the loss of $5 billion. In February, it clearly stated that it will launch the next generation\u00a0of EVs only a time\u00a0when they can be profitable.\u00a0Earlier in April, Ford announced it intends to slow down its major EV programs. Ford has been forced to reconsider to\u00a0launches of three-row EVs in Canada and its next-generation electric pickup truck built in Tennessee. In a separate announcement, Ford\u00a0announced it will delay the\u00a0deliveries of\u00a0its\u00a0all-new EV truck it will build at a new plant in western Tennessee until 2026. Last year, it planned to kick off production in late 2025, aiming for an annual output of\u00a0500,000 electric trucks. But after reconsidering, it decided to build the output gradually.\u00a0Meanwhile, Ford continues to boost its hybrid offerings.\n\nFord and GM are running back to gas-powered trucks.\n\nOne thing that is clear is that both Ford and GM are getting power from their combustion trucks at the moment, but the EV era is still coming.\u00a0GM and Ford are due to provide more details on the tweaking of their strategies as they\u00a0report their results on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Key Predictions Ahead of General Motors (GM) Q1 Earnings",
        "content": "General Motors GM is slated to release\u00a0first-quarter 2024 results\u00a0on Apr 23, before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter\u2019s earnings and revenues is pegged at $2.06 per share and $40.61 billion, respectively.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors\u2019 first-quarter earnings per share has been revised upward by 4 cents in the past 30 days. The bottom-line projection, however, indicates a year-over-year decline of 6.8%. The top-line estimate suggests year-over-year growth of 1.6%.\n\nIn the last reported quarter, GM topped earnings estimates on better-than-expected sales in North America.\u00a0In the trailing four quarters, the company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, with the average being 19.95%. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nGeneral Motors Company Price and EPS Surprise General Motors Company Price and EPS Surprise\n\nGeneral Motors Company price-eps-surprise | General Motors Company Quote\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for General Motors this time around. The combination of a positive\u00a0Earnings ESP\u00a0and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is the case here.\n\nEarnings ESP: It has an Earnings ESP of +7.77%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate of $2.22 per share is pegged 16 cents higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our\u00a0Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nZacks Rank: General Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2.\n\nYou can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nGeneral Motors\u00a0recorded its best first-quarter retail sales in the United States since 2021. The company\u2019s retail sales in the country rose 6% year over year in the quarter under discussion, buoyed by increased demand. Retail sales at key brands, namely Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC, increased 6%, 9%, 10% and 3%, respectively, on a yearly basis.\n\nOur model estimate for revenues from the GMNA segment stands at $33.8 billion, calling for a 3% year-over-year increase. Our projection for revenues from the GMI segment (excluding GM China joint venture) is pegged at $3.9 billion, indicating an increase of 6.3%. We anticipate wholesale shipments from the unit to rise 5.1% year over year. Our estimate for sales from the GM Financial unit is pegged at $3.48 billion, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 4.3%.\n\nOur estimate for sales from GM\u2019s autonomous driving unit, Cruise, is pegged at $25.2 million, almost unchanged from the year-ago figure. We expect the Cruise unit to incur an operating loss of $358 million in the to-be-reported quarter, narrower than $561 million incurred in the year-ago period.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s cost containment efforts bode well for operating profits. GM is focused on reducing fixed costs. It reduced $1.4 billion of fixed costs\u00a0in 2023 and expects to further cut $1 billion in fixed costs this year. Reduction of complexities across its current and near-term product programs is likely to generate additional savings. These factors spark optimism for the upcoming results.\n\nOther Stocks With Favorable Combination\n\nHere are a few players from the auto space that, per our model, have the correct ingredients to post an earnings beat this time.\n\nAllison Transmission ALSN will release first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 25. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.27% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALSN\u2019s to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.89 per share and $765 million, respectively. Allison surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.45%.\n\nPACCAR PCAR will release first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 30. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PCAR\u2019s to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings and revenues is pegged at $2.17 per share and $8.06 billion, respectively. PACCAR surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 17.07%.\n\nAmerican Axle AXL will release first-quarter 2024 results on May 3. The company has an Earnings ESP of +674.43% and a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AXL\u2019s to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings and revenues is pegged at 1 cent per share and $1.52 billion, respectively. American Axle surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 0.52%.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the\u00a0Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "General Motors (GM) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about General Motors Company (GM).\n\nGeneral Motors currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.86, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 22 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.86 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 22 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.1% and 4.6% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for General Motors here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying General Motors, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs GM Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for General Motors, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.3% over the past month to $9.12.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for General Motors. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for General Motors may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "General Motors Company (GM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "General Motors Company (GM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned -2.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors falls in, has lost 10.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nGeneral Motors is expected to post earnings of $2.06 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.5%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $9.12 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.8%. This estimate has changed +1.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.25 indicates a change of +1.5% from what General Motors is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for General Motors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor General Motors, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $40.61 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $173.28 billion and $174.15 billion estimates indicate +0.8% and +0.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGeneral Motors reported revenues of $42.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $2.12 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.78 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.4%. The EPS surprise was +10.71%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGeneral Motors is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Should You Buy General Motors (GM) Ahead of Earnings?",
        "content": "Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and General Motors Company GM may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\r\n\r\nThat is because General Motors is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for GM in this report.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.22 per share for GM, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.06 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for GM, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +7.77% heading into earnings season.\n\nGeneral Motors Company Price and EPS Surprise\n\nGeneral Motors Company price-eps-surprise | General Motors Company Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\r\n\r\nGiven that GM has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for General Motors, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "LKQ Corporation LKQ is slated to release first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 23, before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) and revenues is pegged at 94 cents and $3.79 billion, respectively.\r\n\r\nFor the first quarter, the consensus estimate for LKQ\u2019s EPS has moved down by 2 cents in the past 30 days. Its bottom-line estimates imply a decline of 9.62% from the year-ago reported number.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for LKQ\u2019s quarterly revenues suggests a 13.30% year-over-year rise. Over the trailing four quarters, it surpassed earnings estimates on one occasion and missed thrice, the average surprise being 3.42%. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nLKQ Corporation Price and EPS Surprise LKQ Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nLKQ Corporation price-eps-surprise | LKQ Corporation Quote\n\nQ4 Highlights\n\nIn fourth-quarter 2023, LKQ\u2019s adjusted EPS of 84 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents. The bottom line rose from the year-ago quarter\u2019s 78 cents per share. The company reported net sales of $3.50 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.51 billion. The top line, however, increased 16.6% year over year.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nPer S&P Global Mobility, the average age of light vehicles in the United States is 12.5 years. Aging vehicles have higher demand for spare and replacement parts. Rising demand for replacement parts is likely to bolster LKQ\u2019s first-quarter results.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s North American and European segments have been performing well. Its 1 LKQ Europe program is expected to have aided the segment\u2019s revenues. Our estimate for quarterly revenues from parts and services in Europe, which has the highest contribution to the company\u2019s revenues, is pegged at $1.70 billion, suggesting a rise from $1.55 billion recorded in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nWe expect revenues from parts and services in the North America unit for the first quarter to be $1.46 billion, indicating a rise from $1.15 billion recorded in the prior-year period.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, LKQ's Specialty segment is facing headwinds in the RV and towing products business. In the fourth quarter, the Specialty unit reported a 7% decrease in organic revenues. Wholesale shipments were down 36.5% in 2023. The trend is likely to have persisted in the first quarter as dealers continue to hesitate in fully restocking accessories, waiting for a noticeable uptick in demand for new units.\r\n\r\nAlso, the decrease in metal pricing is likely to adversely impact the profitability of the Self-Service segment. In 2024, commodity prices are anticipated to pose a headwind of 9 cents on the EPS, as the current precious metal prices incorporated in the guidance fall below the average for 2023. The headwind from commodity prices is likely to have hurt the company\u2019s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for the automotive replacement parts supplier for the quarter to be reported, as it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. A positive Earnings ESP, combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), increases the odds of an earnings beat.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: LKQ has an Earnings ESP of -2.57%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: LKQ currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nHere are some players from the auto space that, per our model, have the correct ingredients to post an earnings beat this time.\r\n\r\nGeneral Motors Company GM has an Earnings ESP of +7.77% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. The company is set to release first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 23. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GM\u2019s to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings and revenues is pegged at $2.06 per share and $40.61 billion, respectively. General Motors surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.95%.\r\n\r\nAllison Transmission Holdings, Inc. ALSN has an Earnings ESP of +1.27% and sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present. The company is scheduled to release first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 25.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALSN\u2019s to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.89 per share and $765.08 million, respectively. Allison surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.45%.\r\n\r\nAmerican Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc. AXL has an Earnings ESP of +674.43% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

        "content": "We are in the initial stage of the first-quarter 2024 earnings season, and the results are so far in line with expectations. Meanwhile, several S&P 500 behemoths are set to beat on earnings next week. A few of them currently carry a favorable Zacks Rank. The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and an earnings beat should drive their stock prices in the near term.\n\nS&P 500 in Q1 at a Glance\n\nU.S. stock markets witnessed an astonishing rally in the past 15 months. The S&P 500 \u2014 popularly known as Wall Street\u2019s broad-market index \u2014 rallied 10.2% in first-quarter 2024 after jumping 23.9% in 2023. Notably, last quarter was its strongest first-quarter performance since 2019. The benchmark recorded 22 all-time highs in the last quarter.\n\nThe rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.\n\nWall Street\u2019s bull run in the first quarter got an added boost from the Fed\u2019s multiple rate cuts signal, to the surprise of a large section of financial pandits, who indiscriminately warned of overvaluation.\n\nMeanwhile, several S&P 500 behemoths are set to beat on earnings next week. A few of them currently carry a favorable Zacks Rank. The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and an earnings beat should drive their stock prices in the near term.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five S&P 500 bigwigs that are poised to beat on earnings results next week. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a positive Earnings ESP. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nOur research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of an earnings beat is as high as 70%. These stocks are anticipated to appreciate after their earnings release. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the last quarter.

        "title": "GM and Ford count on gas-powered trucks as EV growth slows",
        "content": "By Joseph White\n\nDETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. automakers General Motors and Ford face a challenge in common when they report first-quarter results next week: Explaining to investors where profit growth will come from in the months ahead as EV growth slows.\n\nThe slowdown in global electric-vehicle demand, intensifying competition from Chinese automakers and high U.S. borrowing costs have forced the U.S. automakers to delay investments and ratchet down costs over the past 12 months. With China's economy slowing and U.S. inflation running hot, a macroeconomic growth boost looks a long way off.\n\nThat has companies like GM and Ford focusing on sales of their core gasoline-powered vehicles, from which they derive most of their profit. GM and Ford are scheduled to report results on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGM CEO Mary Barra will get a lift from strong demand for the automaker's highly profitable Chevrolet and GMC brand pickup trucks and SUVs. Barclays earlier this month boosted its target price for GM shares by 10% to $55, citing robust sales for GM's truck and SUV lineup.\n\nGM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said the year was off to a good start and the company felt positive about where demand was trending, while Ford CFO John Lawler, in reaffirming the company's full-year profit outlook, said vehicle prices were holding up better than expected.\n\nLegacy U.S. automakers, which rely heavily on sales of large trucks and SUVs, have been bogged down by higher expenses related to electrifying their vehicle lineups and bumpy demand for battery-electric vehicles.\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Chris McNally said in a research note that the momentum has shifted for the previous winners like Tesla as growth in EV sales slows. Investors have refocused instead on GM, Stellantis, Toyota and others that rely less on EVs, he added.\n\nThe high ratio of gas-burning trucks to EVs in GM's North American sales mix will help offset a projected loss in the automaker's operations in China. GM said first-quarter U.S. vehicle sales slipped 1.5% on lower commercial-customer deliveries, but retail sales jumped 6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBarra has yet to outline specific plans for restructuring GM's China business. Last year, GM delivered 2.1 million vehicles in China, down almost half from the 4.04 million it reported in 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, investors want an update at GM's struggling Cruise robotaxi unit.\n\nBarra has not said how GM will fund relaunching and rebuilding the business after a serious accident forced the company to halt driverless ride operations. GM has said it will slash spending by $1 billion this year at Cruise. The unit has lost more than $8 billion since GM acquired it in 2016.\n\nCruise said on April 9 it will put some vehicles back on the road in Phoenix, Arizona, with human drivers.\n\nThe Detroit automaker's shares jumped in January when it signaled more cash would be returned to shareholders.\n\nFord, too, is getting power from its combustion truck business, as well as its Ford Pro commercial vehicle operations. The automaker reaffirmed its forecast for $10 billion to $12 billion in core profit this year.\n\nThe automaker earlier this month said it would slow two major electric-vehicle programs. CFO Lawler told an investor conference that future EV investments will not go forward unless they can \"stand on their own\" to show a profit.\n\n(Reporting by Joe White in Detroit; Additional reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

        "content": "In its upcoming report, General Motors Company (GM) is predicted by Wall Street analysts to post quarterly earnings of $2.06 per share, reflecting a decline of 6.8% compared to the same period last year. Revenues are forecasted to be $40.61 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 1.6%.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This reflects how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reevaluated their initial estimates during this timeframe.\n\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to gauge how the business may have fared during the quarter, examining analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics often helps gain a deeper insight.\n\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific General Motors metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Total net sales and revenue- GM Financial' will reach $3.50 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +4.7%.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Total net sales and revenue- Total Automotive-GMI' should come in at $4.48 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +20.2% year over year.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Total net sales and revenue- Total Automotive-GMNA' reaching $32.26 billion. The estimate points to a change of -1.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Total net sales and revenue- Total Automotive' at $37.62 billion. The estimate points to a change of +2.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Total net sales and revenue- Total Automotive-Corporate' will likely reach $43.65 million. The estimate indicates a change of +40.8% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Total net sales and revenue- GM Cruise' will reach $37.62 million. The estimate indicates a change of +50.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Worldwide - Wholesale Vehicle Sales - Total GMNA' to come in at 720.64 thousand. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 723 thousand in the same quarter last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Worldwide - Wholesale Vehicle Sales - Total' of 916.45 thousand. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 864 thousand in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Worldwide - Wholesale Vehicle Sales - Total GMI' should arrive at 189.77 thousand. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 141 thousand in the same quarter last year.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Operating segments- GM Financial' will reach $683.80 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $771 million.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Operating segments- GMNA' to reach $2.76 billion. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $3.58 billion.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Operating segments- GMI' stands at $297.41 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $347 million.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for General Motors here>>>\r\n\r\nShares of General Motors have demonstrated returns of -0.9% over the past month compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.7% change.

        "title": "Not Sold on Tesla\u2019s Robotaxis? 3 Self-Driving Car Stocks to Buy Instead.",
        "content": "For many years, people have been excited about the future of cars. Some think of flying cars, while others think of cars that don\u2019t even need manual driving. Both of these are somehow coming to life, especially for cars with advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS). Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has led the way in many respects with its attempt to create a truly full-self driving fleet of robotaxis. This is part of Levels 3-5 in the range of autonomy. Currently, Tesla\u2019s FSD technology remains at a Level 2. However, there are more companies other than Tesla dabbling in this area. This is why we made this list of self-driving car stocks.\n\nThere are companies out there that are currently operating in what most experts would call the autonomous driving realm. Some even have a fleet of operational robotaxis in key markets.\n\nFor those looking to bet on the future of this space, let\u2019s dive into three self-driving car stocks. I think these could actually be front-runners in the race toward automation in the automotive sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSelf-Driving Car Stocks to Buy: Alphabet (GOOG) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe all know Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) as one of the Magnificent Seven stocks. However, this is also a company that\u2019s a leader in the self-driving car market. The company\u2019s subsidiary Waymo has seen impressive growth in recent years, Recently, the company released paid robotaxi services in the Los Angeles market.\n\nDespite initial resistance from the Teamsters Union and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, Waymo obtained regulatory approval for the service expansion. This was done after offering complimentary \u201ctour\u201d rides.\n\nWaymo also revealed on April 9 that more than 50,000 individuals awaited their service\u2019s launch. However, they didn\u2019t specify the number of initial users. Operating within a 63-square-mile area from Santa Monica to downtown L.A., Waymo started with fewer than 50 cars in Los Angeles. Like traditional ride-hailing platforms like Uber, Waymo\u2019s driverless units also have the same easy function. This now marks a growing trend for autonomous transportation.\n\nWaymo\u2019s robotaxis are certainly very cool to see in action. I\u2019ve only seen videos, but do endeavor to take one on my next trip to L.A. The fact that these vehicles are completely autonomously operated is dystopian in a certain way, but also speaks to the impressive level of innovation and investment Alphabet has made in making these vehicles extremely safe.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logo\n\nSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother company that\u2019s not necessarily known for driverless cars, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is a key player in the autonomous driving race. The company\u2019s Cruise division is its self-driving robotaxi arm, which has had its fair share of troubles over the past year. GM stopped development on its Cruise platform after a pedestrian incident in San Francisco. Many thought the project may be dead, and GM\u2019s stock price took a hit following this news.\n\nHowever, the company has said it\u2019s planning to resume testing of its self-driving robotaxis in Phoenix, Arizona in short order. Recent reports indicate that Cruise could see a limited return this year, potentially restarting in Houston or Dallas, following last year\u2019s suspension.\n\nCruise had made some amazing progress, and was a leader in the autonomous driving space before its recent safety incident. A management reshuffle, and a clear message being sent that safety is the number one priority with this program, is a good thing in my books. If the company can re-calibrate and get things right, it\u2019s a stock to watch in the self-driving world, for sure.\n\nFord (F) Ford logo badge on grill of car\n\nSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nA long-time GM rival, Ford (NYSE:F) is another company that\u2019s looking to enter the self-driving space. A later addition to this nascent market, Ford has announced it\u2019s taking a cautious and thoughtful approach to entering the market. The company aims to roll out a fourth-generation self-driving text vehicle (built on its Escape Hybrid platform) in key markets. The company\u2019s partnership with Argo, a self-driving company Ford began investing in previously in 2017, is thus now starting to yield fruit.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to see how this roll out ultimately goes. But Ford has said that it\u2019s on the way to launching a full sell-driving service in short order, once an appropriate amount of testing is done.\n\nFord might be the more high-risk bet in this space, to be sure. The company is focused on increasing its return on invested capital to 20% from 2023\u2019s 14% over the next four years. This aligns the company\u2019s investments with more strategic objectives aimed at generating more stable growth. If the company can get self-driving right, it could be a key player in the U.S. market over the long-term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "Earnings Preview: Ford Motor Company (F) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Ford Motor Company (F) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.42 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -33.3%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $40.64 billion, up 4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.95% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ford Motor?\n\nFor Ford Motor, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -39.90%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ford Motor will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ford Motor would post earnings of $0.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.29, delivering a surprise of +141.67%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nFord Motor doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nGeneral Motors Company (GM), another stock in the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.06 for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -6.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $40.61 billion, up 1.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for General Motors has been revised 2.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 7.77%.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that General Motors will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Under $10 Stocks to Buy Now: Q2 Edition",
        "content": "Amidst the current market uncertainty, some companies stand out in their respective industries. The companies discussed here have the potential for massive growth and have already established themselves in the sector. While the stocks are trading under $10, it by no means speaks about its potential to grow. I think they are the best under-$10 stocks to buy now.\n\nWhether you are a beginner and only getting started in the stock market, or a professional with many years of experience, these three under $10 stocks could be solid bets and generate massive returns by 2026. They are well-positioned in the industry and have reported strong financials.\n\nDo not judge the company by the stock price, instead, bet on the company\u2019s business structure, financials, and cutting-edge technology. Let\u2019s take a look at the three under-$10 stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nI have been writing about the fintech player SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI)\u00a0for a while now. As one of the strongest players in the industry right now, SoFi is giving strong competition to traditional banks and has offered an ideal solution to the younger demographic who is always looking for ways to save, invest, borrow and pay online.\n\nThe company reported its first-ever quarterly profit and saw strong revenue growth. It has seen a steady rise in users and products which has helped achieve profitability. Despite the strong financials, SoFi stock hasn\u2019t moved much and is trading for $7 today. It is down 26% year-to-date and has been moving sideways since March.\n\nThe upcoming quarterly results could give the stock a much-needed push and we could see it move towards $10. There is a strong demand for its lending products and the segment saw a 24% year-over-year rise in the fourth quarter to reach\u00a0$1.6 million.\n\nIt ended the year with 7.5 million members, up 44% YOY. The market is concerned about the future of SoFi after the hotter-than-expected inflation report. However, even if the interest rate cut is pushed back by a few more months, I think SoFi can survive.\n\nEven in a high-interest rate environment, the company managed to achieve user growth. It can attract customers to different products and expects to see 50% growth in the financial services segment this year.\n\nThe company is steadily growing its market share with solid technology, low operating costs, and an advanced platform. While it will continue to focus on the lending segment for growth, its deposits have also shown impressive growth. SOFI stock is worth buying and holding on to for the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) a pile of lithium. lithium stocks\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.com\n\nIt is too early to write off the beaten-down Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) stock. Renewable energy stock LAC could become a huge market player over the next four years. Its Thacker Pass project has the country\u2019s largest lithium resource and this asset could generate massive cash for the company. It has a net present value of $5.7 billion, a mine life of 40 years and will begin construction in 2027.\n\nThe U.S. Government has lent $2.26 billion to the company as a federal loan to help with the production at the Thacker Pass. Lithium is going to become a hot property in this decade and investing in LAC right now will mean strong gains. However, do not expect the stock to move higher anytime soon.\n\nTrading at $5 today, the stock has lost 16% value in the year and is down 18% YTD. The prospects of interest rate cuts seem attractive and could give a boost to the electric vehicle industry in the second half of the year. This will lead to a higher lithium demand.\u00a0LAC is one of the best under-$10 stocks to buy now.\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) has already invested $650 million in Lithium Americas which is also the largest ever investment by an automaker for the production of battery raw materials. The stock is a long-term play but we will have to wait until the Thacker Pass commences production to see strong fundamentals. However, buying the stock below $10 could be one of the best decisions you make.\n\nXPeng (XPEV) Xpeng (XPEV) car logo in Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition. EV stocks to Buy\n\nSource: THINK A / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectric vehicle maker Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) stock has gone from a high of $64 in 2020 to $7 today. The road hasn\u2019t been smooth and the journey has been tough but XPeng is not the one to give up. Despite the massive competition in the EV industry, XPeng is making moves and delivering strong numbers. Down 48% YTD, the stock has dropped due to the modest EV demand and the high-interest environment.\n\nHowever, its\u00a0March delivery numbers impressed investors. The company reported 9,026 vehicle deliveries in the month, up 99% month-over-month and 29% YOY. Overall, in the first quarter, it delivered 21,821 cars, up 20% YOY. It has successfully managed to achieve the quarterly delivery target.\n\nThat said, the company also announced partnerships with car dealers in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand for the launch of its G6 model. XPeng has ambitious goals of\u00a0launching 30 new, or refreshed models over the next three years.\u00a0To expand its global market share, the company also made its entry into the German market with two EV models. As compared to its competitor Nio (NYSE:NIO), XPeng is showing strength in an uncertain market environment.\n\nIt is aiming for expansion into other European markets this year and expanding out of China could work in favor of the company. It wants to breakeven by 2026 and an improvement in the EV sector can make it possible.\u00a0 The future of transportation is electric and the demand for EVs will eventually pick up, this is when we could see the XPEV stock rally.\u00a0If you are looking for stocks to buy now for under $10, start here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Why Investors Should Avoid Nio Stock at All Costs in 2024",
        "content": "Nio stock (NYSE:NIO) ,the Chinese luxury electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, was once a highly sought after company. Its sleek designs, innovative battery-swapping technology, and ambitious expansion plans captivated the market.\n\nHowever, a storm of challenges raises questions about Nio\u2019s growth trajectory and their ability to become GAAP profitable. Increasing competition, reduced sales and delivery expectations, and macroeconomic headwinds also pose a major threat to their future growth and aspirations. This analysis will delve into these factors, exploring why investors may want to steer clear of Nio stock in 2024.\n\nThe EV Market Battleground\n\nThe global EV market, once characterized by limited players and blue-sky potential, has become a fierce battleground. Traditional auto giants like Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Volkswagen are aggressively ramping up their EV production.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNio stock faces intense pressure from these legacy brands that possess deep-rooted manufacturing expertise, global distribution networks, and strong brand recognition. The company\u2019s global ambitions are also quite delusional, especially when you consider that they have barely penetrated the Chinese EV market.\n\nA swarm of Chinese EV companies like BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY), XPeng (NYSE:XPEV), and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) directly target Nio\u2019s core luxury market segment. Many of these companies mentioned are already profitable, and have much more attractive price points. This is bad news for Nio, as they are seeing signs of continued weakness in 2024.\n\nSome of the weaknesses include declining gross margins and a cut to their Q1 2024 delivery estimates. This downward revision is evident of the current macroeconomic backdrop, as inflation and higher interest rates tapered demand for luxury EVs. While Nio\u2019s revenue growth has accelerated over the past few years, their operating losses have grown exponentially alongside it. This lackluster reality highlights the true cost of operating in an extremely competitive and capital intensive business.\n\nInflation and Higher Interest Rates\n\nRising inflation has been a global phenomena for the past 24 months, and it is rampant in the global economy. These macroeconomic conditions pose a serious threat to Nio\u2019s growth prospects in 2024.\n\nThe specter of inflation and higher interest rates create an unfavorable environment for growth stocks, especially those that remain unprofitable. Borrowing costs have remained relatively high, and it has eroded consumer spending and confidence.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough spending has remained high, it is largely a reality for everyday essentials like food, housing, and transportation. The current economic landscape across major economies do not support growth for the luxury EV market. This will more than likely signal stagnant growth, and delayed profitability plans for Nio, if that ever does come.\n\nThe Final Call: Sell Now or Regret Later\n\nNio stock once held potential in the growing EV market, but that ship has now sailed. The combination of a crowded EV market, macroeconomic uncertainty, and prolonged unprofitability cast a long shadow over its investment thesis in 2024.\n\nMoreover, one of Nio\u2019s largest institutional investors, Baillie Gifford, dumped nearly 84% of their stake as of Q4 2023. This is not a good sign for Nio stock, and investors are better off cutting their losses before the stock sees further declines in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Rivian\u2019s Future Hangs by a Thread: The Bearish Case for RIVN Stock",
        "content": "When electric-vehicle manufacturer Rivian stock (NASDAQ:RIVN) entered the scene, its debut represented a breath of fresh air. While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains the sector leader, its designs have arguably become predictable and therefore stale. On the other hand, Rivian effortlessly blended classic lines with modern accoutrements, thus bolstering the case (at the time of its debut) for Rivian stock.\n\nUnfortunately, reality has impacted the sector. To be sure, the fallout isn\u2019t a problem exclusive to Rivian stock. Notably, Tesla cannot gain any traction this year, losing more than 31% of equity value since the beginning of January. But during the same period, RIVN incurred red ink to the tune of nearly 57%.\n\nFundamentally, Rivian suffers from a range of problems. However, the biggest headwind may be that RIVN is as an all-or-nothing proposition. It\u2019s a pure-play EV maker, meaning that if the EV ship sinks, RIVN has nowhere to go. Simply based on realities, I have to adopt a bearish stance on Rivian stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSector Woes Greatly Cloud Prospects for Rivian Stock\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much research to discover the many outside problems clouding the upside prospects for Rivian stock. From the higher upfront price point of EVs to how long they charge to the myriad frustrations associated with public charge points, you can take your pick. However, what is arguably the most impactful for RIVN and its peers is the sector-wide price war.\n\nStarted by Tesla, the price war stemmed from an understandable directive. By lowering prices on a desired brand, the company could boost its own sales while slowing the advance of its rivals. Management must have thought that it could even kill momentum permanently for some troublemakers. Still, the counterargument at the time was that it was a war Tesla couldn\u2019t win.\n\nAs InvestorPlace\u2019s Louis Navellier pointed out, that early assessment appears to have turned true. Navellier mentioned that Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report reflected the damage that its own initiative imposed. So if TSLA is hurting \u2013 the one EV enterprise with massive social cachet \u2013 then Rivian stock likely stands no chance.\n\nOf course, the problem for RIVN is that it can ill afford margin killing dynamics in its core industry. As of Dec. 31, 2023, Rivian\u2019s retained loss comes out to nearly $18.6 billion. To be fair, the idea here is that eventually, the company will become richly profitable. When it does, these retained losses will become retained earnings.\n\nHowever, investors of Rivian stock likely understand that because of the price war, the pathway to profitability will take longer than expected. For fiscal 2024, analysts previously anticipated a loss per share of $4.03. For fiscal 2025, this metric could improve to a loss of $2.53 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, we just don\u2019t know what may materialize.\n\nElectrification or Bust\n\nMoving forward, what could really do Rivian stock in might not necessarily be the price war. Rather, it could be the previously mentioned all-or-nothing approach that pure-play EV manufacturers must take. Unlike legacy automakers, Rivian and its ilk can\u2019t pivot to combustion-powered cars and hybrids.\n\nIn my opinion, that\u2019s where an automotive giant like General Motors (NYSE:GM) enjoys a key advantage. Here\u2019s what I stated about the company\u2019s product portfolio last week:\n\nIf you want an affordable SUV that can carry groceries and the kids, GM has your back with the Chevy Equinox or the Blazer. Should you prefer something more upscale, the company gives you the Cadillac brand. And if you want to experience the thrill of premiere automotive performance, you have the mid-engine Corvette, America\u2019s supercar.\n\nWhat makes it worse for Rivian stock is that when conditions normalize \u2013 if they normalize \u2013 then the legacy automakers who have scaled back their EV ambitions can then pivot back into the space. With GM, it has the opportunity with its Ultium battery and EV platform to \u201celectrify\u201d its most-popular models. In the meantime, legacy players will continue to soak up consumer dollars that could have gone to RIVN.\n\nPerhaps the biggest threat here is Toyota (NYSE:TM). For the longest time, the Japanese automaker refused to wholeheartedly embrace EVs. Company President Akio Toyoda went so far as to suggest that the industry\u2019s \u201csilent majority\u201d had questions about the full-throated transition to electrification.\n\nTurns out, Toyoda was right, at least in terms of consumer demand (I\u2019m not sure about the silent majority part). Toyota is on course to post record net profit thanks to booming sales of its hybrid vehicles. That\u2019s the benefit of having options.\n\nThe Takeaway: RIVN Doesn\u2019t Control its Fate\n\nIn conclusion, the bearish case against Rivian stock may be summed up as follows: the underlying company doesn\u2019t control its fate. Because it is a pure-play EV manufacturer, it doesn\u2019t have expertise in other mobility platforms. And if the sector leader is struggling, that leaves little room for optimism for RIVN. Therefore, as a matter of practicality, investors probably should avoid Rivian until there is more clarity in the industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Genuine Parts Company GPC is slated to release first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 18, before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pinned at $2.15, implying growth of 0.47% from the year-ago reported number. The consensus estimate has moved down 11 cents in the past 60 days.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.85 billion, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 1.39%. Genuine Parts surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 4.29%. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nGenuine Parts Company Price and EPS Surprise Genuine Parts Company Price and EPS Surprise\n\nGenuine Parts Company price-eps-surprise | Genuine Parts Company Quote\n\nQ4 Highlights\n\nIn fourth-quarter 2023, GPC\u2019s adjusted earnings per share of $2.26 surpassed the consensus mark of $2.20 and rose 10.2% year over year. High-than-expected profits from the Industrial Parts segment resulted in the outperformance. The company reported net sales of $5.59 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.63 billion. The top line, however, rose 1.2% year over year.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nPer S&P Global Mobility, the average age of light vehicles in the United States is 12.5 years. Aging vehicle increases the demand for automotive replacement parts, which is likely to have benefited GPC in the to-be-reported quarter. The growing number of miles driven and high vehicle financing costs are driving demand in the automotive aftermarket, enhancing segmental revenues. The Industrial division is also experiencing revenue growth fueled by manufacturing expansion and a diverse customer and end-market portfolio.\r\n\r\nThe increase in revenues from both segments is likely to have bolstered the company\u2019s overall first-quarter performance. Segment-wise, our estimate for first-quarter revenues from the Automotive unit is pegged at $3.54 billion, indicating a rise from $3.50 billion recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2023. Our estimate for first-quarter revenues from Industrial is pinned at $2.31 billion, indicating a rise from $2.26 billion recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2023.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company has been bearing the brunt of increasing selling, general and administrative costs for the past several quarters, which is denting operating profits, and the trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter. GPC is focused on developing and upgrading its offerings to remain on par with the evolving trends in the automotive market. The new features and component designs require high capital expenditure, which might have limited the company\u2019s cash flows in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for GPC this time around. A positive Earnings ESP, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: GPC has an Earnings ESP of +0.62%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: GPC currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nHere are some players from the auto space that, per our model, have the correct ingredients to post an earnings beat this time.\r\n\r\nGeneral Motors Company GM is set to release first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 23. The company has an Earnings ESP of +4.37% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GM\u2019s to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings and revenues is pegged at $2.06 per share and $40.61 billion, respectively. General Motors surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.95%.\r\n\r\nBorgWarner Inc. BWA is scheduled to release first-quarter 2024 results on May 2. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.87% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for BWA\u2019s to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings and revenues is pegged at 88 cents per share and $3.54 billion, respectively. BorgWarner surpassed earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed twice, the average surprise being 4.84%.\r\n\r\nAmerican Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc. AXL is slated to release first-quarter 2024 results on May 3. The company has an Earnings ESP of +674.43% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AXL\u2019s to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings and revenues is pegged at 1 cent per share and $1.52 billion, respectively.

ATGE, KB Home KBH and General Motors Co. GM.\n\nPick These Low P/CF Stocks to Boost Your Portfolio\n\nValue investing is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. It is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.\n\nThere are different valuation metrics to determine a stock\u2019s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company\u2019s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. PagSeguro Digital Ltd., Adtalem Global Education Inc., KB Home and General Motors Co. boast a low P/CF ratio.\n\nThis metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis \u2013 the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.\n\nAnalysts caution that a company\u2019s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.\n\nPositive cash flow indicates an increase in a company\u2019s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company\u2019s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.\n\nHowever, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.\n\nHere are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nStory continues\n\nPagSeguro Digital, which provides financial technology solutions and services, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

        "content": "General Motors Company (GM) closed the most recent trading day at $42.69, moving -0.91% from the previous trading session. The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 1.2% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.65%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 1.79%.\n\nThe company's stock has climbed by 5.87% in the past month, exceeding the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's loss of 2.23% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.85%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of General Motors Company will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on April 23, 2024. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.06, reflecting a 6.79% decrease from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $40.61 billion, reflecting a 1.56% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $9.08 per share and revenue of $174.98 billion, which would represent changes of +18.23% and +1.83%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for General Motors Company. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.84% higher. Right now, General Motors Company possesses a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that General Motors Company has a Forward P/E ratio of 4.75 right now. This signifies a discount in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 14.48 for its industry.\n\nWe can also see that GM currently has a PEG ratio of 0.53. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Automotive - Domestic industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.13 as of yesterday's close.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 104, placing it within the top 42% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nTo follow GM in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy Now Before the Robotaxi Revolution",
        "content": "When Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) founder and CEO Elon Musk announced a date of August 8 for its robotaxi event, the stock managed to nudge higher amid its multi-year downturn. Though shares have since reversed lower again, everybody will tune in when Musk hits the stage this summer. The company\u2019s potential innovations may just be able to help Tesla regain its magnificence.\n\nUndoubtedly, the nascent robotaxi market has experienced setbacks over the past year. With General Motors (NYSE:GM) pulling back on its Cruise robotaxi service after an incident, it seems that overly ambitious investors may have underestimated the difficulty of putting the finishing touches on full self-driving. Though Cruise has since restarted in the state of Arizona, only time will tell if robotaxis are finally ready for prime time.\n\nIn any case, the following robotaxi plays seem pretty cheap given the relatively muted expectations for robotaxis and self-driving vehicles as a whole.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TX\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany people doubted Musk\u2019s ability to steer the electric vehicle (EV) juggernaut into profitable growth. And though Tesla\u2019s margins are poised to take a hit as auto headwinds persist over the near term, the robotaxi opportunity may make TSLA prove seriously undervalued. But it must deliver on August 8.\n\nAs it stands, it doesn\u2019t seem like most investors are willing to bet on the big day to turn Tesla\u2019s tides around.\n\nIndeed, betting against Musk\u2019s Tesla may have paid off in the past two years. But a long-term short may be dangerously risky as Tesla looks to show just where it stands in the robotaxi race. In any case, I expect TSLA stock to be extremely choppy as we head closer to August.\n\nThe robotaxi revolution, as Musk sees it, may very well be underway and it may not include LIDAR. Even if it\u2019s not, I continue to view Tesla as a top robotaxi contender that will be ready to make the splash, whether it be this year or several years from now.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An Apollo self-driving car from Baidu drives around California.. BIDU stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese tech giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) could give Tesla and other autonomous vehicle top dogs a good run for their money. With AI expertise and a permit to operate its robotaxi services in Wuhan and Chongqing, Baidu may gain an upper hand over American counterparts.\n\nEven still, Baidu has a way to go as it seeks permits to become fully autonomous in major Chinese localities. Additionally, it\u2019s tough to tell how Chinese regulators will go about giving robotaxi firms the green light. Will it be easier or tougher as tech innovators look to safely go about handling those difficult-to-predict corner cases?\n\nStory continues\n\nIn any case, Baidu is an intriguing play for investors with the courage to bet on a Chinese internet titan. At writing, the stock trades at 13.4 times trailing price-to-earnings after having lost more than 65% of its value since its short-lived 2021 peak.\n\nUber (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nUber (NASDAQ:UBER) has been incredibly hot, melting up by nearly 140% over the past year. With improving fundamentals and sustained growth, derailment of this transportation titan is unlikely. Though shares have gotten pricier amid its recent ascent, I do view the firm as a potential beneficiary from the rise of robotaxi services, regardless of which company ends up first.\n\nSure, Uber may have given up on its self-driving unit in the back half of 2020. However, that doesn\u2019t mean the company can\u2019t ride on another firm\u2019s coattails by introducing autonomous vehicles aboard its ride-hailing platform.\n\nIn any case, I believe Uber already has a robotaxi dance partner in mind. That would be Waymo of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG). Though the firm may have taken a back seat on self-driving innovation, it still has plenty to offer. Most notably, it has impressive algorithms and trove of user data.\n\nShould robotaxis hit the road in droves, I wouldn\u2019t count UBER stock out of the game. In fact, I\u2019d argue it stands to gain further from the advancement of self-driving technologies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Alphabet (Class C).

        "title": "UPDATE 2-GM moving to new Detroit headquarters in 2025",
        "content": "By Nora Eckert\n\nDETROIT, April 15 (Reuters) - General Motors is moving its headquarters deeper into downtown Detroit after spending more than 20 years in its riverfront home at the Renaissance Center, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday.\n\nA GM spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment, but the U.S. automaker has scheduled a press conference at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) with CEO Mary Barra and Dan Gilbert, an owner of property in downtown Detroit. Gilbert also owns the Cleveland Cavaliers team of the National Basketball Association.\n\nThe Michigan automaker will now place its global headquarters a few blocks away from the so-called RenCen, in a sleek new high-rise building called Hudson\u2019s, which will be the second-tallest skyscraper in Detroit.\n\nGM remains the only member of the Detroit Three automakers to have its headquarters in the Motor City. Ford Motor's home base is nearby in Dearborn, Michigan, and Chrysler parent Stellantis has its main North American office in Auburn Hills, Michigan, about 30 miles (48 km) outside of Detroit.\n\nFord is in the process of rehabilitating Michigan Central Station in downtown Detroit - the city's historic but dilapidated former rail station - to be a large hub for tech workers and software engineers.\n\nThe GM headquarters \u2013 with its glowing logo pasted atop one of the towers \u2013 has become an important part of Detroit's skyline since the automaker purchased the property in 1996. The move to this location was \u201ca milestone that helped spark a downtown renaissance,\u201d the company says on its website.\n\nGM and real estate firm Bedrock, which is led by Gilbert, plan to study how to redevelop GM's Renaissance Center headquarters, the Associated Press reported earlier on Monday, citing a person briefed on the plan.\n\nWhen the automaker allowed remote work during the pandemic, Barra fielded questions about whether GM would remain on the riverfront.\n\nThe company has since instituted a policy where workers are asked to come to the office three days per week.\n\nGM also has a technical center in Warren, Michigan, that is the home base for many of its workers.

        "content": "The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 and the Defense Production Act are two examples of why renewable energy stocks can make a comeback, thanks to increasing regulatory activity as we move into the next U.S. election cycle. The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (NASDAQ:ICLN) is down around 11% this year, but both the Republican and Democrat camps can lead to a revival thanks to new policy proposals coming to light.\n\nAnalysts expect a \u201cChina shock 2.0\u201d for U.S. stocks as China produces cheaper renewable energy goods. With cheaper renewable energy products flooding the market, the U.S. government must reconsider and promote domestic firms. This will cause other nations to respond, snowballing renewable energy stockpiles.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) A phone displaying the logo for Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC)\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) operates more than 550 solar facilities, 100 wind farms and 200 hydropower projects worldwide, insulating the business from country-specific headwinds, such as a hawkish Fed in the U.S.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOperating a global business gives it an advantage over any country-specific tailwinds, especially in North America and Asia-Pacific.\n\nIn its prior earnings announcement, EPS exceeded forecasts by 123%, exhibiting industry leadership. BEP Q4 2023 results include record FFO of $1.1 billion, proving its operational approach works despite resource cyclical uncertainties.\u200b\n\nWith late-year capacity additions, BEP gained 5,000 megawatts in 2023. The annual FFO increased by almost $100 million, as a result.\n\nThe corporation is adding a lot more projects to its pipeline of development, which now has approximately 18 gigawatts planned for the next three years.\n\nBeyond profitability and predictions, BEP seeks high shareholder returns. In 2023, Brookfield Renewable aggressively repurchased 2 million units via the regular course issuer offer, confident in its growth strategy and share value. Buybacks accompany industry-leading 6% yields.\n\nFinally, BEP is also heavily involved in M&A activities. By forming a partnership to purchase Westinghouse Electric Co., Brookfield Renewable is venturing into nuclear energy.\n\nThe company also recently bought Duke Energy Renewables, strengthening its U.S. presence and renewable expertise.\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) First Solar logo on smartphone in front of computer screen with graphs. FSLR stock\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is a pioneer in the photovoltaic (PV) industry and gains from tax credits for solar power installations provided by the Defense Production Act and the Inflation Reduction Act of the United States government.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts are positive about First Solar thanks to steady financial performance and acquisitions like Evolar, boosting its technological stack. The \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus foresees a roughly 20% upside based on a $210 price target. But Guggenheim analysts are going one better, setting a high price objective of $334.\n\nThe analyst\u2019s excitement makes sense because the firm is expanding its manufacturing capacity with new facilities in Alabama, Louisiana and India. Production will start in 2024 and 2025.\n\nFirst Solar has agreements to sell $700 million in advanced manufacturing IRA tax credits. First Solar\u2019s ambitious Alabama, Louisiana and Ohio growth will profit from these tax breaks.\n\nStaying in Ohio, the company is spending up to $370 million in a Perrysburg R&D innovation facility that will open in 2024 and creating new Series 7 modules.\n\nWith an 81.8 GW order backlog through 2030, First Solar has significant revenue visibility and financial stability, with 65.9 GW booked over this backlog.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen. Renewable Energy Stocks\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) finishes off our list of renewable energy stocks, with a potential upside of over 16% thanks to its Nevada-based Thacker Pass project, the country\u2019s largest known lithium resource with a net present value of $5.7 billion.\n\nSubject to certain requirements, the U.S. Department of Energy is providing $2.26 billion to LAC. The Thacker Pass, expected to begin construction in its first phase by 2027, needs this money.\n\nFurthermore, astute strategic choices made by LAC, such as corporate reorganization, will draw investors searching for renewable energy stocks.

        "title": "GM plans to move headquarters to different building in Detroit, source says",
        "content": "By Nora Eckert\n\nDETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors is moving its headquarters deeper into downtown Detroit after spending more than 20 years in its riverfront home at the Renaissance Center, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday.\n\nA GM spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment, but the U.S. automaker has scheduled a press conference at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) with CEO Mary Barra and Dan Gilbert, an owner of property in downtown Detroit. Gilbert also owns the Cleveland Cavaliers team of the National Basketball Association.\n\nThe Michigan automaker will now place its global headquarters a few blocks away from the so-called RenCen, in a sleek new high-rise building called Hudson\u2019s, which will be the second-tallest skyscraper in Detroit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGM remains the only member of the Detroit Three automakers to have its headquarters in the Motor City. Ford Motor's home base is nearby in Dearborn, Michigan, and Chrysler parent Stellantis has its main North American office in Auburn Hills, Michigan, about 30 miles (48 km) outside of Detroit.\n\nFord is in the process of rehabilitating Michigan Central Station in downtown Detroit - the city's historic but dilapidated former rail station - to be a large hub for tech workers and software engineers.\n\nThe GM headquarters \u2013 with its glowing logo pasted atop one of the towers \u2013 has become an important part of Detroit's skyline since the automaker purchased the property in 1996. The move to this location was \u201ca milestone that helped spark a downtown renaissance,\u201d the company says on its website.\n\nGM and real estate firm Bedrock, which is led by Gilbert, plan to study how to redevelop GM's Renaissance Center headquarters, the Associated Press reported earlier on Monday, citing a person briefed on the plan.\n\nWhen the automaker allowed remote work during the pandemic, Barra fielded questions about whether GM would remain on the riverfront.\n\nThe company has since instituted a policy where workers are asked to come to the office three days per week.\n\nGM also has a technical center in Warren, Michigan, that is the home base for many of its workers.\n\n(Reporting by Nora Eckert and Ben Klayman in DetroitEditing by Chizu Nomiyama and Matthew Lewis)",

        "title": "Pick These 4 Low P/CF Stocks to Boost Your Portfolio",
        "content": "Value investing is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. It is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.\r\n\r\nThere are different valuation metrics to determine a stock\u2019s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company\u2019s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. PagSeguro Digital Ltd. PAGS, Adtalem Global Education Inc. ATGE, KB Home KBH and General Motors Company GM boast a low P/CF ratio.\r\n\r\nThis metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis \u2013 the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.\r\n\r\nAnalysts caution that a company\u2019s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.\r\n\r\nPositive cash flow indicates an increase in a company\u2019s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company\u2019s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.\r\n\r\nHowever, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.\n\nThe Bargain Hunting Strategy\n\nHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:\r\n\r\nP/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.\r\n\r\nPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\r\n\r\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\r\n\r\nP/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.\r\n\r\nP/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.\r\n\r\nP/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company\u2019s sales \u2014 the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.\r\n\r\nPEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\r\n\r\nValue Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.\r\n\r\nHere are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:\r\n\r\nPagSeguro Digital, which provides financial technology solutions and services, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

        "title": "5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Enhance Your Portfolio",
        "content": "When considering valuation metrics, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has always been the obvious choice, as calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, in the case of companies that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profits, price-to-sales (P/S) is a good valuation metric. It helps investors identify cheap stocks.\n\nOther than P/E and P/S, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use tool for zeroing in on low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.\n\nThe P/B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.\n\nThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company GM, JD.com JD, KB Home KBH, Qifu Technology QFIN and Adtalem Global Education ATGE are some such stocks.\n\nNow, let us understand the concept of book value.\n\nWhat is Book Value?\n\nThere are several ways by which book value can be defined.\u00a0Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company\u2019s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.\n\nIt is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders\u2019 equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company\u2019s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.\n\nUnderstanding P/B Ratio\n\nBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.\n\nA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.\n\nFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.\n\nBut there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock\u2019s price may be significantly high \u2014 thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one \u2014 in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.\n\nIn any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.\n\nPrice to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company\u2019s sales/revenues \u2014 a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.\n\nPrice to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share \u2014 a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.\n\nPEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.\n\nCurrent Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\n\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000:A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\n\nValue Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.\n\nHere are five of the eight picks that qualified the screening:\n\nHeadquartered in Detroit,\u00a0General Motors is one of the world\u2019s largest automakers. General Motors, along with its strategic partners, produces, sells and services cars, trucks and parts under four core brands \u2014 Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac.

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 15 best places to retire in Maine. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating retirement living in the US, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Maine.\n\nTo Retire or Not to Retire?\n\nThis past week - April 8 to April 12 - was known as \u2018America Saves Week\u2019 in the land of the Star-spangled Banner. The week, a joint effort by the American Savings Education Council and America Saves, is a nationwide call for Americans to set themselves on a path leading to successful saving. While a positive endeavor, not everyone in America holds the same sentiments when it comes to saving.\n\nOn the whole, Americans are pessimistic when it comes to financial retirement savings. For instance, a recent study by the National Institute on Retirement Security revealed that 79% of Americans believe that the country is facing a retirement crisis. While worrying on its own, this number shows a 12% increase from 2020. This sentiment has spread to American politics, with 90% of Americans believing that the country\u2019s next president and Congress should place Social Security funding at the forefront of their agenda.\n\nThis pessimism surrounding retirement and retirement savings has spilled into another area of life - the workplace. A sizeable portion of American workers no longer imagine retirement the traditional way. A survey conducted by The Harris Poll in February of 2024 revealed that as high as 30% of Americans are planning to only partially retire, staying on in consulting or part-time work. Another 7% have even more drastic plans - they do not plan to retire at all.\n\nFor those who plan to continue with work at and beyond the age when others usually retire, the reasons are multifold. The Harris Poll lists them as such in decreasing order of likeliness - stimulation, occupying one\u2019s time, being independent, and getting to experience fulfillment or enjoyment. Indeed, The Harris Poll is not the only source that reports a trend of moving away from retirement.\n\nStory continues\n\nA 2023 report by the Pew Research Center estimated that about 20% of American senior citizens were still part of the workforce. This is almost double the about 10% of senior citizens who continued to work in the 1980s. Here, too, the Pew Research Center attributes this to a feeling of financial insecurity that obstructs older Americans from leaving the workforce. Adding to this is the increasing American lifespan. Life expectancies have gone up, and the longer a person lives, the more money they require to sustain themselves.\n\nIn a surprise move, rather than shunning the involvement of older individuals in the workforce, many companies in corporate America have embraced it open-heartedly. Names such as The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), and Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) are among the frontrunners in the movement to embrace the older work population. While each company follows its own policy and accommodates senior workers differently, the result is the same - staying at work after 65 becomes easier.\n\nFor instance,\u00a0 Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) provides the opportunity to create more flexible work schedules, whereas Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) does not penalize worker benefits as they transition to part-time. As for The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), both companies have launched re-entry programs which are aimed at older individuals who have left the workforce and are looking to rejoin.\n\nIt is natural then that when the time to retire does finally roll around, it is more sacred than ever. Many retirees search for the best places to retire in the US - which includes popular choices such as Melbourne and Fort Myers in Florida. Another popular retirement option is the state of Maine. In fact, Senior Living places Maine as the state with the highest ratio of older residents in its population - almost 44% of Maine\u2019s population is in the 50 and above age range.\n\nTo facilitate present and potential retirees in navigating the move to Maine state, we have compiled a list of the 15 best places to retire in Maine. 15 Best Places to Retire in Maine\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 15 best places to retire in Maine, we consulted several sources including our list of 15 Cities in the Northeast to Retire on $3000 a Month, Niche, The Travel, Movoto, NewHomeSource, Unbiased, Planswell, Kiplinger, amongst others. Once a list of places was compiled, we ranked them across multiple factors, namely, their cost of living, their livability scores, and their median house price. For this article, livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, and median house prices were taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) and Realtor, whereas the cost of living index was Insider Monkey\u2019s own. Our cost of living index covers housing, utilities, food, transport, taxes, and healthcare, where an index score of 100 depicts the US national average. A cumulative score was then assigned to each place - livability scores were given a double weightage - with the 15 highest-scoring places making our list of the 15 best places to retire in Maine.\n\nFor places that gained an equal score, their cost of living index was used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are the 15 best places to retire in Maine:\n\n15.

        "title": "Girl Power Portfolio: 3 High-Potential Stocks With Women CEOs to Buy Now",
        "content": "In a setting historically dominated by male leadership, women at the helm of major corporations is still considered something of a novelty. You don\u2019t see many articles about a company\u2019s first male CEO, but there\u2019s always a buzz when the first woman gets hired to the same position.\n\nAs of January 2023 only 10% of the Fortune 500 companies were run by a woman. That\u2019s surprising considering a study conducted by S&P Global found that in the two years following their appointment, \u201cfemale CEOs saw a 20% increase in stock price momentum.\u201d Companies with more gender diversity on their board of directors are also more profitable.\n\nInvestors may not specifically consider stocks with women CEOs when looking at here to invest. However, the women on this list and the companies they represent are great examples of how female leadership can turn a company around or help it continue to thrive in an otherwise tumultuous market. Their different upbringings and paths to business bring a unique perspective that can change the outlook of a company.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logo\n\nSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.com\n\nMary Barra has been the CEO of General Motors (NYSE:GM) since January 2014. She is the first female CEO of the \u201cBig Three\u201d automakers that includes Ford (NYSE:F) and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA). She is currently the only female CEO in the U.S. auto industry.\n\nYear-to-date (YTD), GM stock is up 23.51%. According to Tip Ranks, it has the best price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of all its competitors at 6.04. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), currently struggling, stands at 38.32. GM has a 15.69% upside with an average price target of $51.17. Based on 19 ratings, analysts consider GM a moderate buy, but Barra has a history of navigating GM through some of its toughest challenges. The future of the company looks bright under her continued leadership.\n\nIn her time as CEO, Barra has spearheaded the process of modernizing General Motors, focusing on the development of electric vehicles (EVs) and improving customer experience. She has also championed the cause of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), which many business executives believe is important for positive business growth. Thanks to her efforts and successes, she was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2023.\n\nThe average tenure of a Fortune 500 CEO is 7.2 years for men and 4.5 years for women. Clearly Barra is doing something right. Not only has she doubled the time in her position as the average female CEO but outperformed her male counterparts as well. Her length of time in the job must mean she\u2019s doing something right. As the auto industry continues to face challenges, Barra\u2019s strong leadership at GM make it not just one of the great stocks with women CEOs, but also a great choice for automotive stocks as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nCVS Health (CVS) the storefront of a CVS pharmacy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nKaren Lynch has been CEO of CVSHealth (NYSE:CVS) since February 2021. While she\u2019s only been at the company a short time, she has made waves with her new approach to the healthcare industry. Part of her grand plan for CVS is to create better health outcomes in the community, including a focus on how the company addresses Medicare as the ever-increasing senior population turns 65.\n\nWith a current average price target of $87.88, CVS stock has a 17.83% upside. While YTD it\u2019s down 8%, it\u2019s doing considerably better than rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), which is down 28% in the same time frame. Walgreens is not doing well right now, while CVS\u2019 performance in 2023 points toward a much healthier future. Recently, the quarterly dividend for CVS was increased by 10%, indicating confidence in the company\u2019s financial future.\n\nLynch recently published \u201cTaking Up Space: Get Heard, Deliver Results, and Make a Difference.\u201d In it, she chronicles her rise to becoming CEO of the sixth-largest Fortune 500 company. Her barrier-breaking attitude towards life is mirrored in her approach to business, and that bodes well for CVS.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nLisa Su has been the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) since October 2014. Like Barra, Su has held her position as CEO longer than most others on the Fortune 500 list. She has also led the company through one of the greatest recent turnarounds in the technology sector.\n\nIf you invested $10,000 at the time Su became CEO, you\u2019d have over $430,000 today. The company was on the edge of bankruptcy when she took over. Her vision, though, led the company to shed its investments in unnecessary divisions. Instead, she honed in on its money-makers: high-performance central and graphics processing units (CPUs and GPUs).\n\nWhile Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) seems to be every investor\u2019s favorite tech stock darling right now, AMD is a solid competitor. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is actually a first cousin once removed of Su, so they\u2019ve kept their success in the family. Despite concerns that both AMD and Nvidia are overvalued, some think AMD is still a good buy. According to TipRanks, there\u2019s still a potential 18.56% upside in comparison to NVDA\u2019s 12.65%. Su\u2019s unique perspective as a female leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) and technology sector might just provide the edge the company needs to outperform its industry sibling.\n\nOn the date of publication, Philippa Main\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nPhilippa Main is a real estate agent in Virginia and Florida who also does freelance writing, editing, and business development and marketing.

        "title": "Car Price Predictions 2024: Proof the Auto Market Crash Has Begun!",
        "content": "Throughout 2024, the new car market maintained unusual stability despite near-record high prices. Setting price forecasts for automotive models has become a constant challenge for many years as factors like the pandemic and supply chain problems arise. That said, buyers and sellers are constantly watching market shifts, making it imperative for everyone to make decisions.\n\nIn 2024, specific new car segments witnessed significant price drops, notably the luxury segment influenced by Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) competitive pricing. In the United States, Tesla remains in the top 10 luxury brands, but it has witnessed a 7% decrease in price over the last year.\n\nMoreover, the price of non-luxury vehicles also saw a slight increase. In February, the average price sat at $45,283, showing a 2% rise from January but a 1% decrease from 2023. Despite stabilizing at record highs, new car prices remain substantially higher, up 30% since 2019.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhy Analysts Say Car Prices Will Decrease\n\nIn October 2023, the average new car price sat at $47,936. Data showed a 1% decrease from 2022, and prices continuously went down 3.5% since December 2022. Predictions hint at further declines in 2024, yet certainty remains uncertain. An oversupply of 5 million vehicles may prompt price reductions.\n\nGOBankingRates interviewed David Meniane, CEO of CarParts.com, to forecast if the downward trend would persist into 2024.\n\nMeniane noted that the timing of your purchase in 2024 will influence your price. \u201cOctober to January is typically the best time to buy a vehicle, especially during the month of December,\u201d he explained. Waiting until year-end may yield substantial discounts.\n\nAdditionally, Meniane anticipates notable price drops for SUVs and used sedans due to projected oil price increases in 2024. Competitive pricing from manufacturers may sway consumers towards larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles. Conversely, new EVs and hybrid cars are expected to maintain or increase prices due to growing demand and emphasis on sustainability.\n\nDue to ongoing supply shortages, cars dependent on semiconductor chips could maintain or increase prices. Meniane explained that disruptions in the supply chain have elevated production costs, potentially leading to higher prices for models heavily reliant on electronic components.\n\nUsed Car Prices\n\nWhen 2024 started, the used car market also witnessed some decreases. However, the good news is that it did not return to its pre-pandemic levels, too, due to high demand. February\u2019s data showed that the first 15 days saw a 13.8% decline in wholesale used car prices. That marked a notable shift in market dynamics compared to the previous year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll vehicle segments experienced declines, notably luxury cars (13.2%), SUVs (13.5%), compact cars (16.9%), midsize cars (15.9%) and pickups (14.6%), compared to February 2023. Month-to-month, prices dropped across major segments, with compact and midsize vehicles declining by 0.7% and 0.1%, respectively. Pickups and luxury cars saw decreases of 1.7% and 1.1%. Electric vehicles depreciated more annually (16.1%) than monthly (0.3%). Cox Auto reported these trends.\n\nCox Auto noted tighter wholesale vehicle supply in early February, with inventory levels significantly below pre-pandemic levels. Despite gradual price normalization, new vehicle surpluses suggest increased availability of used cars in the future. Surveys show consumer optimism regarding the automotive market, contrasting concerns about broader inflation.\n\nWhat Kelley\u2019s Book Says\n\nIn February data from the Kelley Blue Book, the average transcription price (ATP) for new cars sits at $47,244, with a 2.2% decline year-over-year. A Cox Automotive analyst Erin Keating also said that affordability remains a challenge for many car buyers.\n\nDespite rising inventory levels benefiting consumers, they are still below optimal levels. In February, manufacturer incentives rose to an average of $2,787, further impacting pricing dynamics.\n\nIn February, non-luxury vehicle prices averaged $44,052, reflecting a 2.1% year-over-year decrease. Luxury vehicle prices averaged $61,424, dropping over 6% annually, with luxury vehicles constituting 18% of total sales. Electric vehicle prices averaged $52,314, down 12.8% from the previous year.\n\nStephanie Valdez Streaty, director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive, noted that despite lower prices and increased competition, EVs remain nearly 19% higher priced than mainstream non-luxury vehicles.\n\nInventory Updates\n\nDealerships gauge their new car inventory through \u201cdays of inventory,\u201d reflecting how long it would take to sell current stock at the present sales rate if production ceased. By March, many brands had inventories 52% higher than a year ago, prompting heavy discounts on surplus vehicles. However, Toyota (NYSE:TM), Honda (NYSE:HMC) and Lexus faced inventory shortages, leading to unfulfilled orders.\n\nDespite ample inventory, specific models like the Toyota Grand Highlander, Ford Maverick and Chevrolet Trax remained scarce. The latter is one of the most affordable cars in the U.S. at $21,495.\n\nCox Automotive\u2019s analysis of vAuto\u2019s new car dealership management software data revealed that Dodge, Jeep, Chrysler and Ram had inventories at least double the industry average. Conversely, Lincoln and Genesis boasted ample stock. Toyota, Honda, Lexus, Land Rover, Kia and Cadillac faced inventory shortages.\n\nOverall, the auto industry held 76 days\u2019 worth of vehicles in early March, down from 80 days\u2019 worth the previous month and 86 days\u2019 worth pre-pandemic in 2019.\n\nThis Is a Buyer\u2019s Market\n\nAmid the economic disruptions caused by COVID-19, new car prices soared, worrying both buyers and automotive investors. However, a recent shift has made new cars more affordable, benefiting buyers and investors alike. Despite a $10,000 increase in average prices since before the pandemic, recent data shows a nearly $3,000 decrease from peak prices in December 2022.\n\nRebecca Lindland, senior director at Cars.com, predicts further improvements for buyers, noting that nearly half aim to spend under $30,000, although only 13% of new cars fall within that range. Low-price availability has increased by 63% compared to the previous year. As dealer inventory and production recover, Lindland anticipates a shift to a buyer\u2019s market, offering reassurance for prospective buyers and investors alike.\n\nNew-car prices would settle around $46,000, surpassing prepandemic levels by about $8,500. Despite projections of a 3% price decline, there\u2019s no anticipation of a drastic crash. Most automakers forecast lower pricing this year yet expect robust profitability, with General Motors (NYSE:GM) targeting a $13 billion operating profit for the year.\n\nConcerns over profit declines have impacted GM stock, trading at 4.8 times estimated 2024 earnings, down from the previous average of around 6 times. While affordability improves, some abnormal aspects persist in the industry\u2019s recovery from pandemic-related disruptions.\n\nThe scarcity of used-car inventory persists due to fewer leased vehicles returning, stemming from reduced car sales in 2020, 2021 and 2022.\n\nAccording to Lindland, approximately 10 million cars are currently unavailable, a situation expected to improve over time. The limited supply of used vehicles could lead to more resilient pricing as buyers weigh options between new and used vehicles.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Why Rivian Stock Got Wrecked Today",
        "content": "Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) stock slid 6.7% through noon ET on Thursday -- but not because of any mistake that Rivian made.\n\nThis time, the blame belongs to Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), which just declared a price war in electric trucks, and turned Rivian stock into roadkill in the process.\n\nHave you driven a Ford lately? (Because it's cheaper than it used to be)\n\nAny day now, Ford archrival General Motors(NYSE: GM) will begin selling its new Silverado EV electric pickup truck in competition with Ford's F-150 Lightning. Ford saw its automotive rival inching closer in the rearview, however, and is gunning the motor to stay ahead -- lowering the price of some F-150 Lightning models by as much as $5,500, as CarsDirect.com reported this week.\n\nIt's not entirely clear whether this move will be enough to maintain Ford's lead over Chevy. Notably, the lowest-trim \"Pro\" F-150 Lightning still costs a pricey $54,995, and the most expensive \"Platinum\" Lightning still costs a nosebleed $84,995. (Price cuts are all on the mid-tier vehicles). What is clear is that Ford's pre-emptive strike at Chevy, and the price war it foreshadows, seems to be spooking investors in Rivian.\n\nIs Rivian stock a sell?\n\nSo how worried should Rivian investors be? Honestly, until we see the new Silverado EV in person, and can tell how well it compares to the Rivian R1T, or even whether it's targeting the same kind of truck-buyer market, it's hard to say. But given Rivian's struggles growing demand for its EVs last year, and the fact that its R1T electric truck's starting price is already higher than that of most Ford F150 Lightning trims, the potential for more competition from General Motors, and lower prices at Ford, probably isn't great news for Rivian.\n\nLong story short, Rivian's work just got harder. And if it has to cut prices to compete in a price war with Ford and Chevy, its path to profitability probably just got a bit longer, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Rivian Automotive wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "General Motors\u2019 GM self-driving vehicle subsidiary, Cruise, is set to resume its operation with a small fleet of human-driven vehicles in Phoenix, AZ, after six months.\r\n\r\nThe company suspended its operation in October, following an accident in which a pedestrian was dragged by Cruise robotaxi after being hit by a different vehicle. After the incident, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a recall for the company\u2019s vehicles.\r\n\r\nPer the company, Cruise is relaunching manual driving to create maps and collect road information in select cities, starting in Phoenix. The vehicle will operate with human drivers with no intervention from the autonomous system.\r\n\r\nThe relaunch of vehicles with human drivers will play a crucial role in validating the company\u2019s self-driving systems as it braces to return to its driverless mission. Cruise did not disclose the timeline for resuming its driverless operation.\r\n\r\nPer Cruise, after halting the operations in October, it has been focusing on rebuilding trust with regulators and communities that it serves to redesign its approach to safety. Under the supervision of new leadership, suggestions from third-party experts and close partnerships with communities in which the company\u2019s vehicles operate, Cruise has made significant improvements. \r\n\r\nBefore the incident, Cruise was aiming to aggressively expand its robotaxi outside its home market. After the incident, the company\u2019s co-founders, including CEO Kyle Vogt, resigned and nine other leaders were dismissed. The company reduced its workforce by 24%.\r\n\r\nBeside GM\u2019s Cruise, Alphabet\u2019s GOOG autonomous vehicle unit, Waymo, and Tesla, Inc. TSLA are working on self-driving services.\r\n\r\nWaymo currently operates driverless ride-hailing services in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and is ramping up production in Austin, TX. It has signed a multi-year partnership with Uber and will provide its robotaxi to the food delivery company to deliver food in Arizona.\r\n\r\nTesla recently announced to launch its robotaxi on Aug 8, 2024. The robotaxi reportedly utilizes TSLA\u2019s latest vehicle platform. In April 2019, Tesla planned to start operating its robotaxis by 2020. The car was expected to last for 11 years and drive one million miles, helping the company and car operators earn a profit of $30,000 each year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "If You Can Buy Only One Lithium Stock in April, It Better Be One of These 3 Names",
        "content": "Lithium carbonate, the rare earth mineral needed to make lithium-ion batteries that power everything from electric vehicles to smartphones, had seen quite some price pressure since interest rates became elevated towards the end of 2022. Looking at lithium prices today, the story is a bit different. While lithium carbonate prices have fallen more than 48% over the past twelve months, they have experienced an uptick since the beginning of the year, increasing more than 16% on a year-to-date perspective. This is great news for the top lithium stocks to buy.\n\nGiven how the market has hammered lithium stocks lately, there are bound to be investing opportunities in the space. Here are the three lithium stocks to consider if you can only buy one.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is a lithium company that primarily mines lithium out of the Thacker Pass project in Nevada, the largest lithium deposit in the U.S. The Thacker project already has tremendous potential, with 16.1 million tons of battery-grade lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) available for extraction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith the Thacker Pass project having received a\u00a0$650 million investment from General Motors (NYSE:GM), the project\u2019s future role in supplying battery materials to power electric vehicles is undeniable. Moreover, the project will likely generate $1.2 billion in annual EBITDA, more than justifying LAC\u2019s current enterprise value of $900 million.\n\nA couple weeks ago, to add to Lithium Americas\u2019 nearly $200 million of liquidity, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)\u00a0approved a $2.26 billion loan, one of its largest investments in the mining industry to date.\n\nLAC shares have risen around 4.4% on a year-to-date basis, and given the potentiality of the Thacker project, buying shares for a long-term hold could be a lucrative trade. Lithium and electric vehicles will be intrinsic to the future of transportation, and holding lucrative lithium projects like LAC will expose investors the long-term benefits.\n\nGanfeng Lithium (GNENF) Person holding mobile phone with logo of Chinese company Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium Co. Ltd. (GNENF) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nGanfeng Lithium (OTCMKTS:GNENF) is a China-based company that happens to be one of the world\u2019s largest producers of lithium products. The Chinese lithium producer has established strategic partnerships with several battery and EV manufacturers, including LG Chem, Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY), BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) and\u00a0Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA). Outside of mining for lithium in China, the company gained stakes in several lithium projects worldwide, including Cauchar\u00ed-Olaroz in Argentina, Sonora in Mexico, Mt. Marion in Australia and Bacanora in the U.K.\n\nStory continues\n\nGanfeng Lithium struggled to grow earnings in 2023, as the China lithium market underwent a period of oversupply. The lithium producer\u00a0eventually posted a 76% drop in profit for 2023. However, Ganfeng Lithium\u2019s chairman\u00a0did mention in early March that the lithium market was set for an upward price trend, and so far, it seems he is right.\n\nLithium prices are on the uptick, and while Ganfeng shares are trading down for the year, now may be a good time to consider an investment.\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM) Sociedad Quimica y Minera logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's web page on it. SQM stock\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) is the second-largest producer of lithium in the world, with operations in both Chile and Argentina. The company also operates one of the largest mines in the world at Salar de Atacama, Antofagasta, Chile. Salar de Atacama not only provides a low-cost, high-quality source of lithium brine but is one of the largest and richest salt flats in the world.\n\nUnfortunately, the company also was not able to avoid the lithium market slump last year. Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile\u2019s Q4 2023 earnings report missed Wall Street estimates due to lower year-over-year average sales prices on lithium carbonate. In its earnings presentation, however, SQM predicted the lithium market demand would\u00a0rebound by 20% in 2024, which is current borne out in the lithium price data these days.\n\nSQM is only trading at only 9.6x forward earnings. Investment bank Jefferies seems to think SQM\u2019s potential is underappreciated. Analysts at Jefferies upgraded SQM to a \u201cBuy\u201d rating and raised their price target from $52.00 to $62.80, citing SQM\u2019s competitive advantage in low cash cost for lithium production.\n\nCurrently down more than 17% YTD, SQM\u2019s stock has room to move its way up to one of the top lithium stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "With slowing demand due to elevated interest rates, the mining sectors have been hit hard since 2022. Moreover, lithium carbonate, the rare earth mineral for making electric vehicles and smartphone batteries, also experienced price pressure. Though the mineral\u2019s price fell more than 48% in a year, a recent uptick in demand raised prices by more than 16% from year-to-date. This increase could likely be due to a\u00a0strengthening market in China.\n\nGold prices have surged as well, rising around 13% since the start of 2024. Given the plethora of mining stocks available and the price trend of certain commodities, there are bound to be opportunities in the market. Below are three 3 mining stocks with untapped potential that investors should start considering.\n\nRio Tinto (RIO) stacks of rectangular aluminum metal stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/SimoneN\n\nUnited Kingdom-based Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is a diversified mining company among the largest in the world. In 2023, the mining firm, like many, struggled as its core commodities, aluminum and iron, dropped in price and demand. However, according to Koyfin, aluminum prices have picked up in the past week alongside a resurgence in Chinese manufacturing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, despite a drop in profits, Rio Tinto remained committed to its shareholder dividend, providing $2.58 per share at a yield of around 6.45%. This, paired with the rise of many commodities, could be attractive to income-focused investors seeking hefty dividends from the firm.\n\nRecent news that Norges Bank Investment Management,\u00a0could sell its $2.7 billion share in RIO due to deforestation concerns has put pressure on the stock. However, should Norges Bank sell its stake, it is likely another fund or group of funds will eagerly fill in the gap. Despite the environmental concerns around mining, the business isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. Thus, investors should consider the real opportunities a multibillion-dollar business like RIO has while it trades at this cheap multiple.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) numerous blue-colored batteries lithium stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is a lithium extraction company focused on the Thacker Pass in Nevada, the largest lithium deposit in the U.S. The Thacker project already has tremendous potential, with 16.1 million tons of battery-grade lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) available for extraction.\n\nWith the Thacker Pass project receiving a\u00a0$650 million investment from General Motors (NYSE:GM), the project\u2019s role in supplying battery materials for electric vehicles is undeniable.

Pair this with the potential of the Thacker project, and buying shares for a long-term hold could be lucrative. Lithium and electric vehicles could be central to the future of transportation, and holding lucrative mining stocks like LAC could provide long-term benefits.\n\nHarmony Gold Mining Company (HMY) A photo of a gold nugget on a table, being picked up by tweezers, with more gold behind it. Stocks to Buy in March\n\nSource: aerogondo2 / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf there was a time to buy gold or gold stocks, it may have been since the beginning of March. Gold prices have soared since then. Nowadays, gold has appreciated nearly 13%, outpacing both the\u00a0S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nHarmony Gold Mining (NYSE:HMY) is one such gold miner that appears to be trading below where it should. This company engages in the exploration, extraction, and processing of gold with\u00a0additional copper exploration through its Queensland, Australia-based mine. Last year, gold price growth was relatively slower when compared to the asset growth we witnessed in equities.\n\nAs a result, Harmony grew revenues by a little over 15% on a year-over-year basis. 2024 could see revenue figures jump even more, especially if gold prices sustain this rally they\u2019re in now. Trading at 9.5x forward earnings, HMY could be a good bet to make right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Auto Giants Surging in 2024: Time to Buy?",
        "content": "In the first quarter of 2024, several auto giants began to show signs of strength. Undoubtedly, shares of numerous traditional automakers have lost considerable ground in recent years at the hands of macro headwinds. However, with newfound momentum and the potential for further upside recovery, these auto stocks could lead the charge as their buzzier electric vehicle (EV) pure-play counterparts look to rest.\n\nIndeed, it was all about EV stocks just two years ago. Nowadays, traditional automakers are starting to make up for lost time with electric ambitions of their own and the ability to meet the needs of prospective customers who see the value of going electric but aren\u2019t quite ready to shift to full-electric anytime soon. Indeed, EVs have come a long way in recent years, but until charging stations become as commonplace as gas pumps, hybrid vehicles may have their moment to shine.\n\nToyota Motor (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nToyota Motor (NYSE:TM) has been a surprisingly stellar performer in the auto scene so far this year. Year to date, TM stock is up a whopping 34.6%, a gain that\u2019s more impressive when you compare it to EV king Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which was down more than 30% in the same time span. With new vehicle launches looming, including the Tacoma pickup, TM stock seems to have enough horsepower (forgive the pun) to take it even higher from here.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Japanese automaker, known for delivering top-notch quality vehicles that last decades at a time, has seen its parabolic melt-off cool a bit since March. I view the modest slip as an intriguing entry point for investors looking to shift gears from the cooling EV pure plays.\n\nThough Toyota has fully electric offerings today, it seems to be playing the long game in its electrification strategy, targeting 70% of global sales to come from EVs by 2030.\n\nSure, that\u2019s not the most ambitious electrification plan in the world, but it\u2019s a realistic one that could help it steadily capture a growing portion of the EV market in the coming years. As Toyota gives itself enough time to innovate in areas such as next-generation solid-state battery tech, I do not doubt the firm will be successful in 2030.\n\nAt this pace, I\u2019m not so sure TM stock\u2019s boom days are ending, as it looks to keep winning the hearts of investors while gradually easing into the EV waters. At 11.1 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), I view TM stock as a potential bargain.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is another long-time auto firm positioning itself from the EV age. Like TM stock, GM shares have been heating up, with 23% gains posted yearly. As the firm accelerates its EV efforts over the coming years, with a number of intriguing new electrified models (think the Silverado EV), GM seems like a prime candidate to take market share away from the current EV leaders, most notably Tesla.\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s plenty of runway for GM to catch up in the EV market. However, whether or not the firm can expand into the space in a reasonably profitable fashion remains a big question. For now, GM expects its American EV portfolio to be profitable in the second half of this year based on its prior expectations. Indeed, demand dynamics in the auto scene can shift gears rather quickly. Still, even if they work against GM in its bid to push into electrified profitability, I expect management will be agile enough to adjust accordingly.\n\nAt 6.04 times trailing P/E, GM stock just looks too cheap, with such low expectations built in that I think the stock could have room to gain if it can hit (or top) goals moving forward.\n\nFord (F) Ford logo badge on grill of car\n\nSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord (NYSE:F) is another old-time automaker roaring this year, with just over 10% gained year to date. Undoubtedly, Ford has its own electric dreams as it aims to shift away from gas guzzlers to EVs gradually. That said, it seems like Ford is willing to walk, not sprint, to catch up to the EV leaders. By doing such, I think the firm drastically reduces its risk of slipping and falling on its face. Indeed, the game has hefty costs and high risks of shifting gears to electric too soon.\n\nFord still seems to be a long way from becoming a serious EV challenger to Tesla as it pulls the brakes ever so slightly on its EV timeline. Indeed, Ford may be wise to play the EV long game while it looks to go heavier on the hybrid market to play what could be a more gradual shift towards mass electrification.\n\nAs exciting as going fully electric is, the hybrid could be key to better results over the medium term, as non-electrified consumers look to gradually ease into the EV scene with something they\u2019re a bit more familiar with. There\u2019s a reason many non-EV drivers haven\u2019t yet made the jump to full electric quite yet! Hybrids may be akin to the VCR-DVD combo players that give consumers a more leisurely time transitioning technologies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Auto Stocks to Buy Amid the EV Sector Blues",
        "content": "While electric vehicles may be the future of mobility and transportation, an old industry is gaining significant relevance, thus driving the case for auto stocks to buy. Further, this fresh dynamic might not fade anytime soon.\n\nFundamentally, one of the biggest challenges facing the EV sector is the ongoing price war. One could make the argument that certain enterprises are only trying to weed out the competition. But it also implies that the overall addressable market is simply not big enough for every player. Otherwise, why bother initiating a directive that hurts your own business?\n\nAmid the malaise in the EV sector, the legacy automotive sector has looked surprisingly impressive. Since the EV carnage might not end soon, speculators should consider these auto stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nToyota (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the elite auto stocks to buy, Toyota (NYSE:TM) has enjoyed an impressive year so far. While popular publicly traded EV companies are drowning in red ink, TM shares have printed a healthy double-digit percentage return. Over the next few years, it could continue delivering solid results for prospective investors thanks to its dominance in one critical category: hybrids.\n\nAs The Wall Street Journal pointed out earlier this year, Toyota forecasted a record $30.3 billion net profit for the fiscal year ending March. Again, that\u2019s due to sales of hybrid vehicles. Here, Toyota is giving the customer exactly what it wants. A dependable and reliable combustion-powered platform that can deliver serious mileage before needing to fill up.\n\nIn some ways, it\u2019s the best of both worlds, taking advantage of established infrastructure while delivering incredible efficiencies. Even better, while other automotive companies \u2013 particularly pure-play EV manufacturers \u2013 struggle for momentum, Toyota hybrids are flying off the showroom floors. TM is easily one of the best auto stocks to buy.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile I\u2019m not exactly a fan of domestic car companies, I love General Motors (NYSE:GM) as an investment. Right now, GM stock trades at a lowly trailing-year earnings multiple of 6.04X and an even more modest forward multiple of 4.91X. Further, shares trade at only 0.35X trailing-year revenue. Quite frankly, I think this is ridiculous but it also makes sense on paper.\n\nYou see, analysts are projecting earnings per share to reach $8.99 on sales of $175.85 billion in fiscal 2024. Last year, EPS was $7.68 on sales of $171.84 billion. So, Wall Street anticipates robust earnings expansion but very modest top-line growth. However, this assessment doesn\u2019t seem to factor in General Motors\u2019 diverse and exciting product portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nEssentially, GM can meet almost any customer needs, from affordable SUVs to luxury sedans to top-of-the-line sports cars. And should the EV sector recover, it can more aggressively pivot there with its Ultium battery and EV platform.\n\nAnalysts peg GM a moderate buy with a $51.17 target, making it an enticing idea for auto stocks to buy.\n\nAutoNation (AN) assortment of cars in a parking lot representing GETR stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhile not a direct candidate for auto stocks to buy, AutoNation (NYSE:AN) should be on your radar. Per its public profile, AutoNation operates as an automotive retailer. It operates through three segments: Domestic, Import and Premium Luxury. With many people still priced out of EVs even with the sector-wide price war, dealerships \u2013 which primarily hold inventory of combustion-powered cars \u2013 could benefit.\n\nYes, AutoNation falls under the consumer cyclical space. Basically, you don\u2019t really need to buy a personal vehicle, especially if you live in the east coast. However, move out west and the paradigm shifts rapidly. Our infrastructure is based on the automobile. Therefore, AutoNation could see increased demand, especially if workplace dynamics fully normalize.\n\nImagine if more companies force their employees back to the office. If that happens, commuting will inherently rise, forcing greater automotive usage. Now, you\u2019re talking greater magnitudes of wear and tear. Sure, it\u2019s a cynical argument. However, that may be one of the reasons why AN sports a moderate buy view with a $182.50 price target.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Mega-Cap Stocks Poised to Double Your Money in 3 Years",
        "content": "Mega-cap stocks are solid investments overall for several reasons. Recently, they\u2019ve been responsible for the lion\u2019s share of increases in the S&P 500. An investor who focused solely on mega-cap stocks would have outperformed the stock market overall during that period. So, \u00a0a high potential for strong returns is one of the best reasons to consider investing in mega-cap companies.\n\nThe other primary benefit of investing in mega-cap stocks is that they are generally safe. Most of these companies are also blue chip stocks, meaning that they are household names. They tend to have long track records of impressive performance that suggest continued stability. On top of that, they often provide income in the form of dividends. It all suggests stability.\n\nThose are two excellent reasons to consider investing. Let\u2019s look at seven mega-cap stocks that have the potential to double your money within three years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMD (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has emerged as a key challenger in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) chip dominance. Generally speaking, that is the reason investors are so interested in the stock currently. Most investors are simply reacting to the general strong sentiment surrounding the firm to rationalize their investment. Dig a little bit deeper, and it\u2019s easy to understand why AMD is indeed a strong investment but also one that can triple within the next few years.\n\nThe logic for believing that statement can be found in comments made by CEO Lisa Su. Late last year Sue predicted that the market for AI data center chips could reach $400 billion by 2027. Analysts from New Street research noted that even if data center spending only reaches half that target in that time frame, it would correlate to a potential quadrupling of AMD\u2019s price, which was roughly $130 at that time.\n\nThat would put its price in the low $500s, which is roughly triple its current price.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nThe arithmetic that governs a potential doubling in ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) stock by 2027 is fairly straightforward. Let\u2019s start by running through that quickly.\n\nAnalysts currently believe that ASML shares could rise approximately 25% in the next year. That Would bring prices to $1,215 in 2025. Let\u2019s imagine that things continue to go well and progress at the same pace for the next two years. That would bring prices just above $1,500 in 2026\u00a0 and near $1,900 by 2027. That equates to a doubling from its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s also perfectly logical to believe that that is possible, given the strength of ASML\u2019s products and their relation to current trends. It\u2019s then one of those mega-cap stocks to consider.\n\nASML is the leading chip tool maker at the leading edge of the technology. the company enjoys a monopoly over extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). That technology is used to etch patterns on the most complex chip wafers and is indispensable in relation to artificial intelligence. If the AI trend continues as it has, it\u2019s entirely likely that ASML doubles in that timeframe.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe\u2019s (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock, like that of so many other companies on this list,\u00a0 is rising and falling on the potential of artificial intelligence. The emergence of artificial intelligence is the reason to believe Adobe could double from here.\n\nNow is arguably an excellent time to stake a position in the stock. Adobe is well known for Photoshop and other graphics tools that position the firm well in the generative AI race. That\u2019s the primary reason that the stock did so well last year. However, Adobe was unable to monetize it to the level investors had expected.\n\nThe result is that Shares currently trade for $485. That follows a strong pullback that began in February. I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s an overreaction to the overreaction that created the hype in the first place. Adobe did not end up buying Figma which many believed was a bad deal to begin with. That\u2019s positive news. Adobe just has to figure out how to better monetize Firefly. There\u2019s a huge opportunity, given the demand for AI products in content creation. Adobe can easily double from its current price point by 2027. This makes it one of those mega-cap stocks for investors to consider.\n\nTesla (TSLA) The Tesla, Inc, TSLA, on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is seen on a screen, viewing the stock price for the electric vehicle and technology company.\n\nSource: The Bold Bureau / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany investors are looking for reasons to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0 stock at the moment. there\u2019s a clear contrarian opportunity for those who can find optimism among all the negativity. Shares currently trade for $170. So, it\u2019s easy to see why they have the potential to double in the next few years, given that they traded above $400 just before quantitative tightening set in.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled, there is plenty of reason for negativity at the moment. Tesla just released its Q1 delivery figures which were disappointing. Elon Musk\u2019s company delivered 386,810 vehicles during the first quarter representing an 8.6% decline year over year. It was the first time since the pandemic began that deliveries fell. Those delivery figures were also far below numbers analysts had been expecting.\n\nBeyond that, competition is heating up in the EV sector. Tesla won\u2019t benefit as strongly from its early competitive advantages moving into the future.\n\nHowever, it isn\u2019t all doom and gloom in the near term. Shipping disruptions in the Red Sea were partially to blame for the lower-than-expected delivery numbers. Furthermore, at some point, the Chinese economy will turn around, and demand will rebound. That should propel Tesla higher in the coming year or so.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite its strong growth, it\u2019s unlikely to surprise many that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has the potential to double from here.\n\nLet\u2019s assume two things; one, Nvidia continues to enjoy a dominant position in relation to AI for the next few years, two, strong metrics continue to hold over that period. Under that scenario Nvidia can double by 2027.\n\nNvidia\u2019s sales are expected to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $102 billion dollars in 2025, per consensus estimates. Some Wall Street analysts believe that revenues could reach $300 billion by 2027 on AI chip sales alone. Nvidia shares would easily double under that scenario and, more realistically, would triple in value, assuming valuations hold steady. Growing from $102 billion in sales in 2025 to $300 billion by 2027 makes that potential very obvious.\n\nMore likely, though, metrics like the P/E ratio would rise even higher if Nvidia sales grow that quickly. Thus, share prices would more than triple if sales grow to that height by 2027.\n\nToyota (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nCould Toyota (NYSE:TM) stock eventually emerge as the biggest winner in the EV revolution?\u00a0 The answer is a resounding: \u201cYes!\u201d\n\nToyota has been building ultra-reliable, somewhat uninspiring vehicles for many decades. The company\u2019s nature is to default to data suggestive of reliability in guiding its decision processes. It\u2019s highly likely that Toyota knew that a pure EV strategy was not the way forward based on such data.\n\nThat got Toyota in trouble relative to other big automobile manufacturers that adopted the EV craze to their detriment. Just look at what has happened to Ford (NYSE:F) and GM (NYSE:GM). Their decision to invest heavily in pure EV technology hasn\u2019t paid off. Toyota believes that a hybrid first strategy is The logical path toward EV profits.\n\nAs the EV hype has died down, Toyota suddenly looks brilliant. The point here is not for Toyota to say I told you so but rather that the company\u2019s slower, iterative approach will win in the end. That\u2019s why I believe the company will ultimately emerge as one of the big winners in the EV race over time. Toyota is likely to find profitability from EVs without sinking unnecessary billions of dollars into the technology in an effort to skip the necessary steps.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that many investors are betting on Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) stock to double in the next few years. Share prices have fallen by more than 75% since late 2020. During that period, Alibaba has gone from a presumed competitor with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to something much less flattering.\n\nIn any case, it\u2019s very easy to find a narrative in which Alibaba doubles in the next few years. Let\u2019s do some simple arithmetic that proves the possibility is entirely real. Alibaba\u2019s price/sales ratio over the last 10 years has a median of 8.34. However, it currently stands at 1.43.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem likely that it\u2019ll rise to the median anytime soon: the Chinese economy continues to experience difficulty. Alibaba\u2019s shares are unlikely to pop for that reason. However, imagine that the P/S ratio doubles. That would correlate to a doubling of price and more, given that sales are predicted to continue growing, albeit at a slower pace. If the Chinese economy rebounds over the next few years, it\u2019s all entirely possible. This makes it one of those mega-cap stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Overlooked and Underpriced: GM Stock\u2019s Compelling Case for Bullish Investors",
        "content": "From a bird\u2019s-eye view, it\u2019s tempting to dismiss automotive giant General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock as an anachronistic enterprise. Yes, the legacy automaker has made a strong pivot to electric vehicles. However, sector leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has long held a vice grip on the ecosystem, making a competitive charge difficult. Nevertheless, circumstances are falling favorably for GM stock, making it a worthwhile investment.\n\nFirst, GM stock itself appears significantly undervalued compared to the rest of the auto industry. Second, the market appears to overstate Tesla\u2019s viability ahead of serious challenges for the EV pioneer. Therefore, GM stock is quietly flying under the radar, making it an attractive idea for forward-thinking speculators. As a result, I am bullish on General Motors.\n\nGM Stock Could Rise on Automotive Excitement\n\nPrimarily, GM stock stands to benefit from an exciting product portfolio. Yes, excitement is a subjective term. However, the concept is backed by objective data. For example, U.S. drivers spend on average 17,600 minutes driving each year. Over a lifespan, that could translate to 4.3 years of one\u2019s life. That\u2019s a long time sitting on a set of wheels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that in mind, buying a new (or new-to-them) car represents an investment of sorts for many drivers. Of course, most vehicles represent depreciating assets. However, because you\u2019re spending so much time in a car, you want the best experience that you can comfortably afford. With a company like General Motors, it offers myriad options.\n\nIf you want an affordable SUV that can carry groceries and the kids, GM has your back with the Chevy Equinox or the Blazer. Should you prefer something more upscale, the company gives you the Cadillac brand. And if you want to experience the thrill of premiere automotive performance, you have the mid-engine Corvette, America\u2019s supercar.\n\nBest of all, General Motors has invested heavily in EVs, forwarding innovations such as its Ultium battery. Whatever the customer wants \u2013 and more specifically, whatever fits the customer\u2019s budget \u2013 GM has it. That\u2019s a huge advantage over pure-play EV manufacturers, which have resorted to price wars to boost sagging demand. Thus, it\u2019s probably no coincidence that GM stock is up almost 23% year-to-date while TSLA is down almost 34%.\n\nChinese Competition Could Dominate EVs\n\nAnother factor that could benefit GM stock is that combustion-based technologies \u2013 whether pure play or hybrid \u2013 may see a longer relevancy pathway than previously expected. That\u2019s because EVs are still more expensive in terms of upfront costs than their combustion-powered counterparts. And because of economic concerns, Tesla may lose significant sheen off its social cachet.\n\nStory continues\n\nLet\u2019s face reality \u2013 EVs are boring. Whenever one pulls up next to me, I don\u2019t notice it audibly and that\u2019s the point. However, it also means that at the core, there\u2019s very little difference between a Tesla and any other EV, especially a Chinese-made EV. Should economic pressures such as inflation and high borrowing costs remain elevated, then over time, people transitioning to electric mobility will likely eschew brand image for price.\n\nWithout getting into pejoratives, an electric motor is an electric motor. It\u2019s not like the difference between an inline-four-cylinder engine versus a V10. That\u2019s a massive contrast that\u2019s immediately recognizable.\n\nSo, with very little separating the heart of a Tesla versus a competing EV, both Tesla and pretty much any western pure-play EV company faces a severe long-term threat from China. It really just comes down to the math. When you factor in holistic costs \u2013 especially labor \u2013 Chinese manufacturers can produce more for less than their American counterparts.\n\nOver the past several decades, manufacturing jobs didn\u2019t move to China because we love the country so much. No, it just makes financial sense to do so. If that wasn\u2019t the case, the jobs would never leave.\n\nGeneral Motors Makes a Great Value Play\n\nRight now, GM stock trades for 4.91X forward earnings and 0.35X trailing-year revenue. As you might imagine, both of these stats rank lower than their sector median stats.\n\nNow, some might argue that this favorable dynamic has materialized because the forward projections are modest. Analysts anticipate earnings per share for the current fiscal year to reach $8.99 on sales of $175.85 billion. Last year, EPS was $7.68 on revenue of $171.84 billion.\n\nIn other words, GM stock could be richly profitable but only benefit from a modest 2.3% growth rate. And fiscal 2025\u2019s sales projection of $178.41 billion implies only 1.5% growth. However, these stats could be understated.\n\nAgain, General Motors offers a diverse and exciting product portfolio that fits practically every budget. It\u2019s also ready to pivot more aggressively to EVs should market demand dictate it. And should China take over the EV space, there\u2019s still a chance that GM could carve out a viable niche.\n\nIt\u2019s a well-recognized and trusted brand. Further, its rich portfolio facilitates flexibility, which is crucial during these times. Therefore, GM stock appears an underappreciated buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

In recent months, Cruise has been in talks with officials in 20 metropolitan areas where it previously ran cars or had started mapping in preparation to run them. Phoenix is a natural place to start as Cruise already has vehicles in the area and city officials were open to the idea of its return, said one of the people, who asked not to be named as the plan isn\u2019t public.\n\nCruise spokesman Pat Morrissey said in an email that the company \u201chad not set a timeline for deployment. We are in the process of meeting with officials in select markets to gather information, share updates and rebuild trust.\u201d\n\nGetting Cruise back on the road is important for GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra, who has pledged to take the carmaker to leadership in electric vehicles and self-driving technology during her tenure. The robotaxi business was supposed to be a key part of her goal to double revenue to $280 billion by 2030. With Cruise\u2019s problems and a slowdown in EV sales growth, that target looks tougher to reach.\n\nThe robotaxi company has been working to earn the public\u2019s confidence after one of its cars struck and dragged a pedestrian in San Francisco in October. Following the incident, California regulators alleged that Cruise initially withheld key footage and details of the incident, which ultimately resulted in the suspension of Cruise\u2019s license in California.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter that, Cruise suspended all operations nationwide, took the resignation of founder and former CEO Kyle Vogt, dismissed nine top executives and laid off a quarter of its workforce. The company later hired a new chief safety officer.\n\nRead more: GM\u2019s Cruise Prepares to Resume Robotaxi Testing After Halt\n\nGetting back on the road will be just the first move in a long road to recovery for Cruise.

The company was also gathering data in preparation to eventually launch across the US, with Atlanta, Seattle, Miami, and Raleigh, North Carolina, possibly following cities in Texas.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit\u2014With an Uncertain Future Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "content": "Lithium stocks are possibly among the most ignored stories from being the hottest commodities in the markets. That\u2019s the nature of the markets, as reactions tend to be on the extremes. Of course, the plunge in lithium price had to be discounted, but most lithium stocks seem to be trading at a valuation gap.\n\nFor investors who are bullish on the lithium story for the long term, this is possibly the best time to accumulate lithium stocks. Estimates indicate lithium supply will increase to 2.14 million metric tons by 2030. The demand is estimated at 3.1 million metric tons for the same year. Therefore, there will be a supply deficit that\u2019s likely to translate into firm lithium prices.\n\nI must add here that analysts are expecting a global lithium shortage by 2025. It might not be long before lithium starts trending higher. Therefore, let\u2019s talk about three lithium stocks that have millionaire-maker potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) Person holding smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) has been in the news with the U.S. Department of Energy\u2018s commitment to a $2.26 billion loan. The loan will help advance the construction of the Thacker Pass project, which will likely commence production in 2027.\n\nThe first phase of Thacker Pass is expected to have an annual production of 40,000tpa. It\u2019s worth mentioning that the company has an offtake agreement with General Motors (NYSE:GM) for 100% of phase one production for 10 years. GM has also invested $650 million in the company in two tranches.\n\nOnce phase two production commences, an additional 40,000tps is expected from the asset. With Thacker Pass having a mine life of 40 years, there is robust cash flow visibility for the long term.\n\nTo put things into perspective, the average annual EBITDA during the first four years (Phase one) is expected at $1.1 billion. Between year and 40, the average annual EBITDA is likely $2 billion. A market valuation of $1.1 billion for the company seems small.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) has witnessed a deep correction in the last 12 months, which is in sync with a decline in lithium prices. ALB stock, however, looks undervalued at current levels of $123. I expect some consolidation around these levels before the stock trends higher.\n\nUndoubtedly, the company\u2019s cash flow potential has been impacted. Further, Albemarle has scaled down its expansion plans. With these cost-cutting measures, the company expects to unlock $750 million in cash flows.\n\nI would, however, look at the long-term picture. Albemarle has maintained its strategy to deliver volumetric growth at a CAGR of 20% through 2027. With strong financial flexibility, Albemarle is positioned to accelerate investments once market conditions improve.\n\nAs of Q4 2023, the company had a liquidity buffer of $1.8 billion and reported net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 1.1. With the company reducing its focus on mergers and acquisitions as a growth accelerant, I expect credit metrics to improve further.\n\nPiedmont Lithium (PLL) Person holding cellphone with logo of US mining company Piedmont Lithium Inc. (PLL) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter plunging by 75% in the last 12 months, Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) is among the most undervalued lithium stocks to buy. With the stock remaining sideways in the last one month, I see early signs of bottoming out.\n\nFurther, considering the value of assets, I expect a multi-fold return once lithium starts trending higher. It\u2019s worth noting that Piedmont Lithium has a market valuation of $250 million. In comparison, the Ghana asset alone has an after-tax net present value of $1.3 billion. The Carolina and Tennessee assets also have a combined after-tax net present value of $4.5 billion.\n\nThere are two reasons for the deep valuation gap. First, the deep correction in lithium. Further, the need to finance the projects. I expect PLL stock to skyrocket once the key assets close the financing gap. It\u2019s therefore a matter of buying and holding with patience as the underlying asset will create value.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, hit by the financial crisis, General Motors filed for bankruptcy on Jun 1, 2009. Just within 40 days, the firm emerged from bankruptcy. In 2010, the company launched its IPO \u2013 the biggest in U.S. history at that time \u2013 and has been steadily profitable since then.

        "title": "Returns Are Gaining Momentum At General Motors (NYSE:GM)",
        "content": "If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So on that note, General Motors (NYSE:GM) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on General Motors is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.054 = US$9.6b \u00f7 (US$273b - US$94b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nSo, General Motors has an ROCE of 5.4%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Auto industry average of 10%.\n\nSee our latest analysis for General Motors  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for General Motors compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering General Motors  for free.\n\nSo How Is General Motors' ROCE Trending?\n\nWe're glad to see that ROCE is heading in the right direction, even if it is still low at the moment. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 5.4%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 23%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat We Can Learn From General Motors' ROCE\n\nAll in all, it's terrific to see that General Motors is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. Since the stock has only returned 18% to shareholders over the last five years, the promising fundamentals may not be recognized yet by investors. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term.\n\nIf you want to know some of the risks facing General Motors we've found 3 warning signs (2 are a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nWhile General Motors may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

        "content": "The electric vehicle sector continues to face a litany of issues. Demand dynamics are not what they once were and EV stocks have cratered \u2014 along with lithium prices \u2014 as a result.\n\nOne of the bigger issues is that electric vehicles also face a number of quality control issues. That may come as a surprise because pundits have long touted EVs \u2014 with fewer components \u2014\u00a0 as potentially being more reliable. However, theory often differs from practice: Over the past 3 years EV owners have reported 79% more problems with their vehicles than owners of traditional vehicles.\n\nTo be fair, EVs are new technology. It will take time for quality to catch up. Nevertheless, those issues make these three stocks a no-go.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Cadillac car and SUV dealership. Cadillac offers a full line of gas and electric EV vehicles. GM stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors\u2019 (NYSE:GM) management is well aware of quality control issues with its electric vehicles. The company has been appealing to investors as it transitions to an EV future intended to boost its stock price.\n\nCFO Paul Jacobson admitted that the company has to resolve quality control issues if it ever hopes to be successful in efforts to become an EV-driven car maker. Jacobson stated: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of unfortunate delays in the programs and we\u2019re making sure that we work out the final bugs because the most important thing, especially when you\u2019re coming with a new platform like these EVs\u201d.\n\nOne Such delay occurred recently when the company decided to halt sales of the\u00a0Chevy Blazer EV amid reports of spontaneous shutdowns. The vehicle\u2019s infotainment systems have been blanking out. Furthermore, there seems to be problems with the vehicle\u2019s battery which is not charging in some instances. For investors who wondered if the EV push was overdone at General Motors this is a great reason to avoid the stock.\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nIt might surprise readers to learn that BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) is the largest EV maker globally. The Chinese manufacturer leads its domestic market and has also expanded internationally. That has generally been a boon for its stock over the past few years. However, it is facing quality control issues which could negatively affect share prices moving forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nReports show that vehicles shipped to Japan had scratches on the paint and those shipped to Europe were plagued with mold. BYD has also made a big push into Southeast Asian markets. In Thailand, the vehicles have become infamous for problems with chipping paint and plastic. In Israel, there are multiple reports that roofs have warped under the weight of roof racks.\n\nAn executive from BYD remarked in the Wall Street Journal that paint chips were the equivalent of going to a \u201cdecent\u201d restaurant and receiving food served on a chipped plate. Strange comparison aside, it\u2019s absurd to refer to your own products as \u201c decent\u201d. That remark could signal a wider commitment to quality is needed at the company.\n\nFisker (FSR) Fisker's (FSR) new Ocean electric vehicle is displayed at the 2021 LA Auto Show.\n\nSource: Ringo Chiu / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Fisker (NYSE:FSR) Ocean seems like a dangerous vehicle. That\u2019s a great reason to avoid investing in its stock at this time.\n\nThe company has received hundreds of complaints related to various issues with the electric vehicle. One of the most common is a sudden loss of power. In fact, Geeta Gupta Fisker, wife of CEO Henrik Fisker was driving one of the vehicles when it suffered such a fate.\n\nThe loss of power in her vehicle was one of more than 100 separate incidents in which the vehicles suddenly stopped operating. As serious as that issue is, it isn\u2019t the only issue playing the vehicle. The vehicle has also been plagued by a sudden loss of braking power and issues in which the key fob gets locked inside the vehicle not due to operator error.\n\nFurthermore, there are instances of the hood flying up during operation. It isn\u2019t difficult to imagine catastrophic accidents resulting from those quality control issues. As a result, investors should avoid fiscal stock at this time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 12 dirt cheap stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nFollowing a notable surge in the broader market throughout 2023, numerous analysts and financial experts are forecasting an impending correction in 2024. Despite such predictions, the market continues to exhibit robust performance and resilience. The S&P 500 closed out the first quarter of the year with an over 10% gain. BlackRock, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:BLK) Managing Director, Tony DeSpirito, believes that a pullback won\u2019t be surprising but keeps a bullish view on the rest of the year. He adds that stocks are set to outperform bonds and cash again this year while advising investors some caution with their equity choices. He believes that \u201cthe opportunity set for stock picking is the most robust\u201d he has seen in 20 years. Tony DeSpirito\u2019s firm sees some secular trends in the market that provide a bullish view on the broader market for the next three to five years. BlackRock, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:BLK) Q2 2024 equity market outlook suggests long-term opportunities in artificial intelligence, clean energy (including utilities and EVs), and the healthcare industries.\n\nPrincipal Asset Management\u2019s CIO, George Marris, also sees signs of a healthy future in the markets. In a CNBCinterview on April 3, he said that while the recent performance of the stock market was credited to a few stocks, he expects a broadening in the market and favors cyclically exposed stocks. Marris forecasts opportunities in industrials, commodities, and UK-listed companies, along with the Chinese and Japanese markets. Among the foreign companies, George Marris believes that there are several UK-based multinational companies that have a geographic footprint similar to the ones in the US and are trading at cheap multiples. He added that in Japan, his firm sees a significant level of corporate reform due to \u201csocietal pressure and domestic activism\u201d.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpportunities in Asian Markets\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, is also showing confidence in the Japanese market, and his firm is upbeat about five specific stocks. The stocks include ITOCHU Corporation (8001.T), Mitsubishi Corporation (8058.T), Sumitomo Corporation (8053.T), Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (8031.T), and Marubeni Corporation (8002.T). In Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s 2023 annual letter to shareholders, Buffett revealed that the firm increased its stake in all five of these companies in 2023 and owns about 9% of each. He wrote:\n\n\u201cIn certain important ways, all five companies \u2013 Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo \u2013 follow shareholder-friendly policies that are much superior to those customarily practiced in the U.S. Since we began our Japanese purchases, each of the five has reduced the number of its outstanding shares at attractive prices.\n\nMeanwhile, the managements of all five companies have been far less aggressive about their own compensation than is typical in the United States. Note as well that each of the five is applying only about 1\u20443 of its earnings to dividends. The large sums the five retain are used both to build their many businesses and, to a lesser degree, to repurchase shares. Like Berkshire, the five companies are reluctant to issue shares.\n\nAn additional benefit for Berkshire is the possibility that our investment may lead to opportunities for us to partner around the world with five large, well-managed and well-respected companies. Their interests are far more broad than ours. And, on their side, the Japanese CEOs have the comfort of knowing that Berkshire will always possess huge liquid resources that can be instantly available for such partnerships, whatever their size may be.\u201d\n\nWhile navigating China\u2019s economy, we reported that the position of the Chinese market holds significant importance to the global market as it is responsible for 10% of the world stock market capitalization and trade, 18% of the world GDP, and 16% of global oil demand. IMF sees several growth opportunities in China due to its ongoing infrastructure development and globalization efforts and believes that if current conditions persist, China could see a 20% expansion of the real economy over the next 15 years.\n\nIn February, we covered the best Chinese stocks to buy, and some of the cheap stocks among them include Vipshop Holdings Limited (NYSE:VIPS), JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.73, 12.89, and 13.48, at the time of writing on April 3, respectively.\n\nAs experts provide a forecast of market broadening, several stocks trading at cheap multiples could provide significant entry points for investors. Some of these dirt cheap stocks include Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR). Also, check out the 10 Best Affordable Stocks Under $10. 12 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to find large to mega-cap stocks with Buy or equivalent analyst recommendations and trailing 12-month (TTM) price-to-earnings ratios (PE) of under 10, as of April 3. We narrowed down our selection to 12 stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them as of Q4 of 2023.\n\nThe hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\n12. Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL)\n\nPE Ratio as of April 3: 9.75\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 49\n\nToll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) is a Fortune 500 company that designs and builds luxury homes and offers its services in 24 states in the U.S. in more than 60 markets. The company provides its services through its brands, Toll Brothers Active Adult, Toll Brothers Apartment Living, Toll Brothers Campus Living, and Toll Brothers City Living.\n\nOn March 13, Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) increased its quarterly dividend by 9.5% to $0.23, and it is payable by April 19 to the shareholders of record on April 5. As of April 3, the stock\u2019s dividend yield is 0.67%.\n\nToll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) has a PE ratio of 9.75 as of April 3. Hedge fund sentiment was positive toward the stock in Q4 of 2023, with 49 hedge funds with investments in the stock at a stake value of $1.241 billion. This is compared to 39 funds with positions worth $897.737 million in the previous quarter. As of December 31, 2023, Edgar Wachenheim\u2019s Greenhaven Associates is the biggest shareholder in the company, with a position worth $569.969 million.\n\nToll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) is one of the dirt cheap stocks that caught the attention of hedge funds in the fourth quarter of 2023, along with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR).\n\nBaron Funds stated the following regarding Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe share prices of our investments in homebuilder companies \u2013 Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) , D.R. Horton, Inc., and Lennar Corporation \u2013 gained 39.4%, 41.8%, and 33.2%, respectively, in the most recent quarter, in part due to the continuation of strong quarterly business results, management optimism about 2024 prospects, and a more than 100 basis point decline in 30-year mortgage rates during the quarter.\n\n2023 was an excellent year for the public homebuilders. Housing fundamentals were resilient despite the affordability challenges of elevated mortgage rates and home prices. Several years of pent-up demand, fears that mortgage rates could move higher, a dearth of inventory in the existing home market, and an overall housing supply shortage drove home buyers off the sidelines to \u201cstretch their wallet,\u201d in part due to fears that they could miss out on the opportunity to buy a home. The Fund\u2019s homebuilding companies Toll Brothers, D.R. Horton, and Lennar increased 108.0%, 71.4%, and 66.3%, respectively, in 2023.\n\nThough we anticipate more modest gains for the Fund\u2019s homebuilder investments in 2024, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for Toll Brothers, D.R. Horton, and Lennar. Further, we continue to believe there is a compelling case for the homebuilder valuations to re-rate higher over time.\n\nSince the beginning of 2020, D.R. Horton, Lennar, and Toll Brothers have demonstrated substantial resilience and operating prowess. Despite several black swan events \u2013 COVID-19, a sharp increase in mortgage rates from 3% to 8%, and supply-chain disruptions \u2013 each company has managed its business exceptionally well and demonstrated that the demand to buy homes is resilient.\u201d\n\n11.

(NYSE:DAL)\n\nPE Ratio as of April 3: 6.50\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 53\n\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) offers passenger and cargo scheduled air transportation and operates through Airline and Refinery segments. The company operates flights to over 290 destinations on six continents and had 190 million customers in 2023.\n\nOn April 1, Morgan Stanley raised the price target on Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) to $85 from $77 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. Furthermore, the firm increased its \u201cbull case valuation\u201d for the company\u2019s shares to $110 from $90.\n\nThe company is one of the dirt cheap stocks to buy, with a PE multiple of 6.50, as of April 3. 53 hedge funds had stakes in Delta Air Lines, Inc.

With 6.798 million shares worth $273,483 million, GMT Capital is the most prominent shareholder in the company as of Q4 2023.\n\nPatient Capital Management made the following comment about Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAirlines returned to trough multiples as higher oil prices pressured costs. Historically, airlines have passed these costs on to customers. We think Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) is a premium brand valued like its economics aren\u2019t sustainable. With mid-teens returns on capital, significant free cash flow generation, excellent capital allocation and long-term earnings per share growth in the high-single to low-double-digits, we think the company is significantly mispriced.\n\nDelta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) reversed course in the third quarter, falling 24% from its highs in July. The airlines in general were hurt from rising commodity prices that are leading to increased cost per available seat mile (CASM). Historically, airlines have passed on higher fuel prices to customers with a lag. We see Delta as a premium global consumer brand that is materially misunderstood by the market. The market still sees airlines as a cyclical, bankruptcy prone industry. An improved supply-demand picture, management discipline and a better business mix make Delta a more resilient business. Their loyalty program with American Express is a source of stable and growing revenues with $6.5B in remunerations this year with a goal of reaching $10B by the end of the contract in 2028. Premium and ancillary service revenue should generate 65-70% of the total in the next year or two. The company should continue to generate consistent mid-teens returns on capital. As the market begins to understand, we believe the company will continue to be rewarded. On top of this, free cash flow is expected to expand generating a cumulative ~$11B from \u201923-\u201925, or one-half of its current market cap. As the company pays down debt while growing the dividend and eventually resuming share repurchases, we think the stock will continue to trend higher.\u201d\n\n7. First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA)\n\nPE Ratio as of April 3: 2.02\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 54\n\nFirst Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA), through its wholly-owned subsidiary First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company, offers retail and commercial banking services. The company has over 500 branches in 23 states. As of April 3, the stock is trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 2.02x.\n\nFirst Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) has received Buy ratings from 6 Wall Street analysts over the past three months.

As of December 31, 2023, Harris Associates is the largest shareholder of the company, with a position worth $710.716 million.\n\nArtisan Partners commented on First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cFirst Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) was our top overall contributor in 2023. Headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, and one of the largest family-controlled banks in the US, First Citizens was a big winner from its acquisition of the failed Silicon Valley Bank. First Citizens purchased $72.1 billion in loans at a deeply discounted price of $16.5 billion. The transaction adds scale, increases geographic diversity and is financially attractive with downside protections from a loss-sharing agreement with the FDIC. First Citizens is now one of the top-15 largest US banks. The bank is run by and almost fully controlled by CEO Frank Holding and his family members. They have significant ownership, aligning their interest with minority shareholders like us. They\u2019ve done an admirable job of growing the bank by keeping a strong capital and liquidity profile that allows for opportunistic M&A during times of market stress, like we just experienced in March. In the global financial crisis, First Citizens used its position of strength to acquire when others could not, and during the COVID-induced stress of 2020, it flexed its muscles again with the acquisition of CIT at a great price.\u201d\n\n6. AerCap Holdings N.V. (NYSE:AER)\n\nPE Ratio as of April 3: 6.30\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 61\n\nAerCap Holdings N.V. (NYSE:AER) is headquartered in Ireland and is involved in leasing, financing, selling, and management of commercial flight equipment. The company serves around 300 customers and has a portfolio of over 1,700 aircraft, nearly 1,000 engines, and more than 300 helicopters.\n\nAccording to our database, hedge fund sentiment in the fourth quarter of 2023 was positive toward the stock as 61 hedge funds had investments in AerCap Holdings N.V. (NYSE:AER) at a stake value of $4.374 billion. This is compared to 54 funds with positions worth $3.207 billion in the previous quarter. Boykin Curry\u2019s Eagle Capital Management is the top investor in the company, with a position worth $938.533 million as of Q4 of 2023. The stock has a PE ratio of 6.30 as of April 3.\n\nAerCap Holdings N.V. (NYSE:AER) is one of the dirt cheap stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Other such stocks include Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR).\n\nO\u2019keefe Stevens Advisory stated the following regarding AerCap Holdings N.V. (NYSE:AER) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cTop picks for 2024 \u2013 Five Point Holdings, LLC (FPH) (FPH) and AerCap Holdings N.V. (NYSE:AER). Both situations are similar, with significant overhangs resolved in late 2023. Aercap acquired GECAS in 2021 for cash and stock. GE consistently sold their AER shares, creating heavy selling pressure. In addition, Aercaps planes on lease to Russian airlines were written off in 2022. Thus far, they received $1.2B in insurance recoverables, and ~$2B remains outstanding. Insurance proceeds provide substantial ammunition to aggressively repurchase shares. Ongoing engine and airplane production issues created a \u201chard market\u201d for secondary transactions. Aercap continually sells planes and engines for over 1.2x carrying value, using proceeds to repurchase stock at or below book value. Note- at a couple of turns of leverage, this ROE is closer to 70%-80%. Repurchasing stock trading at 90% of BV is almost a 100% delta between private market transactions and the stock. That is one hell of a trade! With airlines scrambling for capacity, Aercap holds substantial bargaining power, driving higher rates and longer terms. Business is flying high.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nTop 10 Alternatives to Aflac 12 Best Drupal Alternatives in 2024 11 Best EV Stocks To Buy For The Long Term\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Like other legacy automakers this week, Ford (F) is the latest to report strong first quarter sales.\n\nFord said Q1 US sales jumped 6.8% to 508,083 vehicles, powered by strong sales of electrified products such as hybrids and EVs. Ford\u2019s Maverick hybrid pickup saw its best quarter ever, with sales jumping 77% in the first quarter. Maverick also powered overall hybrid sales to a 42% jump to 38,421, with Ford claiming this was also the best quarter for hybrids and that momentum will continue.\n\nFord's EV offerings \u2014 the Mustang Mach-E, Ford Lightning EV, and its commercial E-Transit vans \u2014bucked the recent trend of softening demand. Ford\u2019s overall EV portfolio saw a massive 82% jump to 20,223 EVs sold in Q1, with Mustang Mach-E jumping 77.3% to 9,589 units sold and the Lightning pickup seeing sales surge 80.4% to 7,743 units. While the sales numbers here are strong, Ford relied on heavy discounting, cheap finance rates, and lease deals to move inventory.

(Ted Shaffrey/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nA down note for Ford, however, was its flagship F-150 sales. Though the F-Series (which includes the F-150 and heavy-duty F-250 and F-350 offerings) retained the crown of America\u2019s top-selling truck, sales fell 10.2% in the quarter to 152,943 units. Ford has experienced a slow ramp-up of the all-new F-150, which started sales in March.\n\nNonetheless, investors are cheering Ford\u2019s sales results today, with the stock up nearly 2% in midday trade.\n\n\u201cThe new F-150 will be a big play for us across gas, hybrid, and electric vehicle segments of our business,\u201d said Andrew Frick, president of Ford Blue, the unit covering Ford\u2019s traditional gas and hybrid offerings. \u201cWith the new F-150 and all-new Ranger sales beginning in March along with the strong performance of our all-new Lincoln Nautilus and Nautilus Hybrid, we\u2019re in a strong position to capitalize and grow as we move through 2024.\u201d\n\nSUVs still did quite well with the Bronco Sport (up 5.7%), Escape (up 70.3%), Edge (up 73.3%), and Expedition (up 11.4%) among the gainers. Vehicles that didn\u2019t perform in the quarter include Ford\u2019s only \u201ctraditional\u201d offering, the Mustang (down 6.8%) and the automaker\u2019s popular full-size Bronco, which saw sales dip 25.8% in the quarter to 24,000 units sold.\n\nStory continues\n\nFord\u2019s overall strong performance in Q1 follows reports from traditional automakers like GM, Honda, Toyota, and Hyundai that are leveraging hybrid and gas-powered vehicles to offset any weakness in EVs, though, like Ford, Korean automakers like Hyundai and Kia are seeing gains in their EV businesses as well.\n\nFord will report full Q1 financial results after the bell on Wednesday, April 24. In late March, Ford CFO John Lawler reiterated 2024 guidance that Ford provided in early February, projecting adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $10 billion to $12 billion, adjusted free cash flow of $6 billion to $7 billion, and capital expenditures of $8 billion to $9.5 billion. Also of note, Q1 will be the first quarter in which Ford\u2019s new bargaining agreement with the United Auto Workers union takes effect.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

GM said sales of trucks and pickups powered results at the retail level.\n\nFor the quarter, GM delivered 594,233 vehicles, down 1.5% compared to a year ago; however, retail sales were up 6%. GM said it delivered more vehicles than any other automaker in the US in Q1. Bloomberg consensus estimates had GM pegged at 591,300 vehicles sold in Q1.\n\nGM said SUV and pickup sales powered sales performance, with GMC and Chevrolet full-size pickup sales gaining market share, now up to 43.7% of the overall pickup market. SUVs like the Chevrolet Trax and other crossovers saw sales jump 11%, and the Colorado pickup was the fastest growing midsize pickup in terms of sales in March, GM said.\n\nOverall, Chevrolet retail sales were up 6%, Cadillac sales were up 9%, and Buick sales were up 10%.

The Silverado EV was only available to fleet customers, but will begin deliveries to retail customers in \u201cthe coming months,\u201d GM said.\n\nChevrolet\u2019s Blazer EV only notched 500 sales in the quarter, though it only resumed sales in March following a stop sale due to a software issue. Looking ahead, the highly anticipated Equinox EV begins sales later in Q2; GM said the Equinox EV will start around $35,000.\n\nStory continues\n\nGM and other legacy automakers' ability to leverage traditional gas powertrain vehicle sales has allowed those companies to weather the current EV demand slump affecting bigger EV names with only minimal overall sales losses.\n\nThat being said, GM only sells a handful of EVs compared to rivals like Tesla (TSLA), though it intends to sell many more when its Equinox EV and Blazer EV production is fully ramped up.\n\nSpeaking of Tesla, the company reported a wide deliveries miss for Q1 earlier today, with concern growing that demand for its vehicles has hit a low point.\n\nGM will report Q1 financial results before the bell on Tuesday, April 23.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "(Adds details, background throughout)\n\nBy Nathan Gomes\n\nApril 2 (Reuters) - General Motors on Tuesday reported a drop in first-quarter U.S. vehicle sales on lower deliveries to commercial customers but managed to beat rival Toyota Motor's local unit as other automakers reported mixed results.\n\nGM's sales fell 1.5% to 594,233 units in the first three months of the year, while Japan's Toyota said U.S. sales rose 20% to 565,098 vehicles.\n\nThe Detroit automaker said last month its fleet business, which caters to customers including car rental firms, was lagging due to availability issues around vans and some midsize trucks.\n\nHowever, GM's retail sales rose 6% as demand for personal transportation remained steady but dealer inventory at the end of March was 534,479 vehicles, up from 456,686 in December.\n\nIndustry experts have flagged pricing pressure due to the rising inventory.\n\n\"While the sales and expenditure performance are impressive, it is coming at the expense of reduced retailer and manufacturer profitability as inventories of unsold vehicles rise and competitive pressures intensify,\" said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power, ahead of the sales data.\n\nAverage transaction prices are expected to be $44,186 in March, down 3.6% from a year ago, according to J.D. Power.\n\nMarch seasonally adjusted annual rate is expected to finish near 15.5 million units, up 0.6 million over last year's pace, but down slightly from February, according to industry consultant Cox Automotive.\n\nMeanwhile, data on electric vehicle sales reiterated easing demand. Market leader Tesla Inc reported a decline in quarterly deliveries for the first time in nearly four years.\n\nGM's EV sales in the first quarter fell 20.5% to 16,425 units from a year earlier. The phasing out of Bolt EV also contributed to the decline.\n\nFord Motor, set to report auto sales later this week, said last month that EV demand is \"much lower than the industry expected,\" and added it would rely on demand for hybrid models \"as an important part of that bridge over the next five years.\"\n\nSales of electrified vehicles, which include hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, rose about 74% to 206,850 units in the quarter, Toyota Motor North America said.\n\nOther Asian automakers Mazda Motor and Mitsubishi reported a rise in U.S. auto sales, while Kia reported a drop. Hyundai said first-quarter sales rose 0.2%. (Reporting by Nathan Gomes, additional reporting by Pratyush Thakur in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 April 2, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are Adtalem Global Education Inc. ATGE, General Motors Co. GM, Unum Group UNM and KB Home KBH.\n\nDesign a Balanced Portfolio with These 4 Low P/CF Stocks\n\nWe believe investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential. Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company\u2019s business.\n\nOne such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis \u2014 the lower the number, the better. Adtalem Global Education Inc., General Motors Co., Unum Group and KB Home boast a low P/CF ratio.\n\nWhy P/CF Ratio?\n\nYou must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, an important factor that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company\u2019s financial health.\n\nAnalysts caution that a company\u2019s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.\n\nA positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company\u2019s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company\u2019s liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.\n\nHere are four of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nAdtalem Global Education, a national leader in post-secondary education and a leading provider of professional talent to the healthcare industry, sports a Zacks Rank #1 currently. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 16.9%, on average. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Adtalem Global\u2019s current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 6.4% and 10.2%, respectively, from the year-ago period. ATGE has a Value Score of B. Shares of ATGE have advanced 33.5% in the past year.\n\nGeneral Motors, which designs, builds, and sells cars, trucks, crossovers, and automobile parts globally, carries a Zacks Rank #2 presently. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 20%, on average.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors\u2019 current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 1.8% and 17.2%, respectively, from the year-ago period. General Motors has a Value Score of A. Shares of GM have risen 25% in the past year.\n\nUnum Group, an international provider of workplace benefits and services, carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.2%, on average.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Unum Group\u2019s current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 4.2% and 6.8%, respectively, from the year-ago period. Unum Group has a Value Score of A. Shares of UNM have gained 36.9% in the past year.\n\nKB Home, one of the largest and most recognized homebuilders in the United States, carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 26.1%, on average.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for KB Home's current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 4.8% and 11.2%, respectively, from the year-ago period. KBH has a Value Score of A.

        "content": "General Motors Company (GM) ended the recent trading session at $45.40, demonstrating a +0.11% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.2%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.6%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.11%.\n\nThe company's stock has climbed by 10.64% in the past month, exceeding the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's loss of 1.71% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.32%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of General Motors Company in its forthcoming earnings report. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $2.02, signifying an 8.6% drop compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $40.61 billion, up 1.56% from the year-ago period.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $9 per share and revenue of $174.98 billion, indicating changes of +17.19% and +1.83%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for General Motors Company. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.01% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. General Motors Company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the context of valuation, General Motors Company is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 5.04. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.2.\n\nWe can also see that GM currently has a PEG ratio of 0.56. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Automotive - Domestic industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.93 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nThe Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 96, putting it in the top 39% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups.

        "content": "If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider General Motors Company (GM). This company, which is in the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 17.31%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, General Motors came out with earnings of $1.24 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 per share, representing a surprise of 10.71%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.84 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.28 per share, delivering a surprise of 23.91%.\n\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for General Motors. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nGeneral Motors has an Earnings ESP of +3.14% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "20 Countries in the World With the Most Female Billionaires",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 countries in the world with the most female billionaires. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries in the World With the Most Female Billionaires.\n\nFemale Billionaires\n\nThe number of female billionaires has increased by almost 70% from 2015 when there were only 197 female billionaires. As per Forbes, there are 331 female billionaires, as of March 2023. Although the number of female billionaires has declined from 337 individuals in 2023 to 331 individuals in 2024, the overall female entrepreneurial economy is improving. According to the Women Entrepreneurship Report 2023 by GEM, over 48.6% of women were involved in the wholesale and retail sector compared to 40.1% of men in 2022. Around 17.6% of women work in Government, Health, Education, and Social Services sectors compared to 10.9% of men. These sectors combined have almost two-thirds of women entrepreneurs compared to one-half of men, which shows how women have progressed in business.\n\nAccording to the Wealth Report 2024 by Frank Knight, the overall Ultra-High-Net-Worth Individuals (UHNWIs) soared to 626,600 by the end of 2023, a rise of 4.2% compared to 2022. The growth was mainly driven by the rise of UHNWIs in North America and the Middle East. In North America, the UHNWIs increased by 7.2% in 2023 and around 6.2% in the Middle East. Women represent over 11% of the global UHNWIs. This is not a large share, however, it reflects swift growth from just under 8% less than a decade ago. Around 71% of global UHNWIs project their wealth to increase in 2024. High-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) expect a more conservative rise of 65% in their wealth this year. Around 64% of women millennials are more passionate about their wealth growth and a higher percentage of 81% of Gen Z women expect higher growth in 2024, with half of them anticipating \u2018significant growth\u2019.\n\nAs we have mentioned in our article about the top 25 richest women in the world in 2024, the female-to-male wealth ratio in high-income OECD countries ranged between 65% and 80% before the pandemic. Data for the rest of the world is limited but gives a wide-ranging ratio, with a minimum female-to-male wealth ratio of 25% in some countries. Women are more inclined towards non-financial assets compared to men and they hold a large portion of non-financial assets.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompanies Run by Female Executives\n\nWomen business owners have a more positive outlook regarding their businesses in 2024, as we mentioned in our article about the top 20 youngest richest women in the world. Around 53% of women business owners anticipate a rise in their revenue by August 2024. While 45% of women owners plan to expand their business. Women executives run 7% of Fortune 500 Europe companies and 10.4% of women run Fortune 500 global companies. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) are some of the leading companies run by female CEOs and executives.\n\nCVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is one of the leading healthcare companies in the world. Karen S. Lynch is the president and CEO of the company. On March 27, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) announced that it is investing over $3 million in grants to support organizations in Phoenix working to improve health care. Here is what the company\u2019s Senior Vice President of CSR and CSO, Sheryl Burke, said:\n\n\u201cWith nearly 12,000 employees working across the state who deliver care through 187 pharmacies, dozens of MinuteClinic\u00ae, speciality pharmacy and Oak Street Health\u00ae locations, and for a million Aetna\u00ae members, this is also a part of our continued work to invest in the communities where we live and work.\u201d\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is one of the largest automobile companies in the US. Mary Barra has been serving the automobile company as CEO since January 2014. On January 30, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) reported its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) posted earnings per share of $1.24, beating consensus estimates by $0.10. The company reported a revenue of around $42.98 billion, surpassing estimates by $3.15 billion. Here is what Mary Barrasaid during the company\u2019s Q4 2023 earnings call:\n\n\u201cAs we begin 2024, I believe GM is well positioned for a year of strong financial performance that builds on everything we accomplished and importantly learned in 2023. Consensus is growing that the US economy, the job market, and auto sales will continue to be resilient. At GM we expect healthy industry sales of about 16 million units. We have an unmatched ICE portfolio in North America, rising EV production on the LTM platform and GM Financial continues to perform well. We're building on a foundation of products that our customers love. In 2023, GM sold more vehicles in the US than anyone else. All of our US brands grew their sales year-over-year and gained US market share with healthy margins, thanks to stable pricing and incentives that were more than 20% below the industry average.\u201d\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the leading semiconductor firms in the world. Lisa Su has been running the chipmaker since October 2014. On March 29, MarketWatch reported that Su earned a total compensation of $30.35 million in 2023, almost 80% more than what Intel Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO, Patrick P. Gelsinger, made. On January 30, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023. The company posted earnings per share of $0.77. The revenue amounted to $6.17 billion, beating estimates by $29.40 million. Here are some comments from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMD) Q4 2023 earnings call:\n\n\"Looking at 2024, we are planning for the PC TAM to grow modestly year-on-year, weighted towards the second half as AI PCs ramp. We continue to see strong growth opportunities for our client business as we ramp our current products, extend our AIPC leadership and launch our next wave of Zen 5 CPUs. Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 17% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to $1.4 billion as lower semi-custom revenue was partially offset by increased sales of Radeon GPUs. Semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections in the quarter. Going forward, we now expect annual revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year as supply caught up with demand in 2023, and we entered the fifth year of what has been a very strong console cycle.\"\n\nWomen continue to thrive and Lisa Su is a perfect example of how women are working at the top level. With that said, let\u2019s take a look at the 20 countries in the world with the most female billionaires.  20 Countries in the World With the Most Female Billionaires\n\n20\u00a0Countries in the World With the Most Female Billionaires\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the 20 countries in the world with the most female billionaires, we took the data from the Forbes Real Time Billionaires list, as of March 30.

        "title": "25 Largest Automotive Companies and Suppliers in the World",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 25 largest automotive companies and suppliers in the world. If you want to skip our overview of the global automotive industry, then you can take a look at the\u00a05 Largest Automotive Companies and Suppliers in the World.\n\nThe global automotive industry is one of the largest in the world, having grown in size after the first mass produced automobiles were offered by Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and Rolls-Royce Holdings plc (OTC:RYCEY). Since then, cars have become significantly more advanced, and in the 21st century, they're also facing stiff competition from next generation vehicles that use electricity and aim to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIts size and tight link with the economy also means that the automotive industry often ends up acting as one of the barometers for economic health. This is because large manufacturers like Ford and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) employ thousands of people in their factories. These workers are dependent on car sales, and if the economy is growing and people can buy more cars, the workers are able to keep a job and vice versa.\n\nHowever, the industry is facing some turbulence. Right now, interest rates in the U.S. are at extremely high levels which do not suit either businesses or consumers. Consequently, electric vehicle stocks are under pressure, making some wonder whether this is the perfect opportunity to position a portfolio for long term growth.\n\nSo, how bad are things for EV automotive stocks? Well, we can check this by analyzing the performance of S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)'s S&P U.S. & China Electric Vehicle Index and S&P Kensho Electric Vehicles Index. These two automotive stock indexes are down by 4.45% and 7.49% over the past twelve months, and their year to date performance is also in the red. This poor performance is also reflected in electric vehicle stocks such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) which are down by 27.61% and 44.54% year to date, respectively. For more electric vehicle automotive stocks, you can take a look at 12 Best EV Stocks To Buy For 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next thing to consider is to check whether the turmoil in the EV industry is also presence in the broader automotive sector and to what extent. Continuing with our brief analysis of stock indexes, two such indexes that cover automotive stocks are the Dow Jones U.S. Automobiles Index and S&P 500 Automobiles (Industry). Well, the former is down by 40% over the year while the latter is down by 25% over the same time period.\n\nOn the news side of things, the automotive industry is bracing for yet another shock as we exit the first quarter of 2024. After the well known coronavirus lock downs that placed Tesla's Elon Musk against California authorities, this time around, it's the Francis Scott Key Bridge's collapse in Baltimore. The bridge's collapse led to the Port of Baltimore suspending shipping, with statements from General Motors and Ford sharing that they would have to divert shipments that were initially directed to the port.\n\nFinally, as investors continue to hope for interest rate cuts in 2024, here's what Diamond Hill Capital had to say about General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) in its third quarter of 2023 investor letter:\n\nSeveral of our bottom contributors were in the consumer area, including auto retailer CarMax and auto manufacturer General Motors. In general, rising interest rates have priced out a large portion of the population who simply can\u2019t afford to buy a car given where financing costs stand today. These challenges have weighed on both companies. General Motors was also impacted by the UAW strike, which put a damper on the automotive industry in general.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the largest automotive companies and suppliers in the world. Some notable names are Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (SHE:300750.SZ). Largest Automotive Companies and Suppliers in the World\n\nPhoto by Yannis Zaugg on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the biggest automotive suppliers and companies in the world, we ranked all publicly traded companies in the industry by their market capitalization and picked out the most valuable firms.\n\nLargest Automotive Companies and Suppliers in the World\n\n25.

        "title": "General Motors has sliced Cruise\u2019s budget by $1B, but says it may bring on new Cruise investors when it starts rolling robo-taxis back on the streets",
        "content": "After an accident last fall that led General Motors-owned Cruise to pull its robo-taxis off the streets, GM is weighing whether it will bring more outside capital into its autonomous robo-taxi subsidiary when it\u2019s finally ready to start putting its vehicles back on the road, a GM executive said earlier this week.\n\nWhile speaking at a Bank of America event on March 26, General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson said that GM was considering bringing in other strategic partners for capital investment.\n\n\u201cYes, we're really looking at everything,\u201d he said in response to a question about new strategic capital in Cruise. \u201cThere's obviously been a lot of capital available for AI. And this is one of the most complex AI implementation[s] that's out there. So we're looking at that,\u201d Jacobson said.\n\nCruise has recorded $9.2 billion in pre-tax losses since GM acquired the company in 2016, according to filings. In recent months GM has overhauled Cruise\u2019s executive team and slashed its budget by $1 billion following an incident last fall in which a pedestrian that had been struck in a hit-and-run was subsequently dragged by one of Cruise\u2019s autonomous robo-taxis in San Francisco. Regulators determined Cruise had not been forthcoming enough with them about the incident, and ordered Cruise to halt its taxi service in San Francisco. Cruise subsequently pulled all of its vehicles off the road across the U.S., and has not yet issued any kind of timeline for putting them back on.\n\nEven so, investors are getting antsy, as GM has poured billions of dollars into the company, and GM\u2019s commitment to Cruise technology\u2014which uses advanced sensors and machine learning systems to help its vehicles navigate and respond to objects around them\u2014has distinguished GM from competitors in the marketplace.\n\nFor now, General Motors has turned most of its current attention with Cruise to rebuilding public trust, addressing safety concerns, and handling ongoing government and agency investigations. Despite the havoc, General Motors has maintained it is still publicly committed to Cruise, though it has been extraordinarily cautious with timing of relaunching vehicles on public roads and has made it clear Cruise will move at a slower pace in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nJacobson specified that GM has been undergoing a \u201cstrategic review\u201d of the Cruise business to determine what the business will look like going forward. Without giving many details on that review, Jacobson said that GM knows it will need to be more disciplined with its spending than it had been.\n\n\u201cWe want to maintain both the urgency of getting the technology, because we do think that it is really strong, and we've built a good lead over many of the others that are out there. But we've also got to be capital-disciplined and find the right way to be strategic about it. So that work is ongoing,\u201d he said.\n\nGM has added Honda, Microsoft, and Walmart as strategic investors in Cruise in the years since it acquired the robo-taxi company in 2016. But it\u2019s been about three years since any kind of partnership has been struck.\n\n\u201cCruise doesn\u2019t require additional capital now,\u201d a GM spokesperson says. \u201cWhere we source capital from in the future will depend on what the plan is to relaunch the business.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 28, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are General Motors GM, Cardinal Health CAH, Cencora COR, Alta Equipment Group ALTG and Asbury Automotive ABG.\n\n5 Broker-Loved Stocks Holding Promise Despite Volatility\n\nThe unfavorable inflation reading for the month of February has dashed all hopes of the Federal Reserve implementing the first rate cut in March. Per data from the Labor Department, the consumer price index rose 0.4% sequentially in February, following a 0.3% increase in January. Moreover, the February reading was up 3.2% year over year.\n\nThe prevalent high interest rates and uncertainty pertaining to rate cuts imply that the present volatility is unlikely to fade away soon. Higher interest rates raise borrowing costs, escalating the chances of an economic slowdown.\n\nHowever, this volatile scenario does not mean that investors should shy away from stocks. Broker-favored stocks like General Motors, Cardinal Health, Cencora, Alta Equipment Group and Asbury Automotive are worth keeping on one's radar for healthy returns despite this uncertainty.\n\nHere's Why Following Broker Advice Works Wonders\n\nBrokers have an in-depth understanding of stocks and great knowledge of the industry and the broader economy. They scrutinize the company's fundamentals and place them against the prevalent economic scenario to find out how attractive a stock is as an investment option or otherwise.\n\nOnly after undertaking thorough research, brokers arrive at their recommendation (buy, sell or hold) on a stock. Such well-researched information is not available to individual investors. So, they, in the absence of proper guidance, may end up selecting the wrong stocks in their portfolio. This might result in their hard-earned money, which they have invested in stock markets, going down the drain. To avoid such an unfortunate scenario from materializing, it is highly desirable for investors to be guided by broker advice while deciding their course of action on a particular stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nFormulating a Winning Portfolio\n\nWe have designed a screener to arrive at stocks based on improving analyst recommendations and upward earnings estimate revisions over the last four weeks. However, considering only these factors does not make our strategy foolproof, as the top line has not been considered.\n\nActually, according to many market watchers, a top-line outperformance is more credible for a company than a mere earnings outperformance. To address top-line concerns, we have included the price/sales ratio in our screener as it serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.\n\nHere are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:\n\nBased in Detroit, MI, General Motors is one of the world's largest automakers. The company's massive electric vehicle (EV) push is commendable. The automaker plans to roll out 30 fresh EV models by 2025-end. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has moved up 16.4%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors's 2024 earnings indicates 17.2% growth from the 2023 actual. GM, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 20%, on average. GM shares have gained 28.6% in a year. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nOhio-based Cardinal Health is a nationwide drug distributor and provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers and manufacturers. CAH's diversified product portfolio bodes well and should drive growth.\n\nCardinal Health, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy), has an impressive surprise history, with its earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average being 15.6%.\n\nChesterbrook, PA-based Cencora is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical services companies. The company should benefit from the strength in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions business. Cencora currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year earnings has been revised 4.3% upward over the past 90 days. COR has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters by an average of 6.69%.\n\nAlta Equipment is an industrial and construction equipment company. ALTG, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, offers new and used industrial products and construction products.\n\nAlta Equipment Group has an expected revenue and earnings growth rates of 5.1% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year. ALTG has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters (missing the mark on the other occasion) by an average of 130.27%.\n\nAsbury Automotive, which operates as an automotive retailer in the United States, carries a Zacks Rank #3, presently. Asbury's diversified product mix and multiple streams of income bode well.\n\nAsbury Automotive outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the last four quarters, missing the mark in the other two quarters. The average beat is 0.86%. Shares of ABG have gained 13.1% in a year's time.\n\nYou can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for a 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard stock picking and backtesting software.

        "title": "GM will be executing on its EV ambitions in 2024, says CEO Mary Barra",
        "content": "Decades of climbing the ladder while challenging conventional thinking has brought Mary Barra to the present \u2014 the year of delivering on ambitious EV goals at storied automaker General Motors (GM).\n\n\"I think in 2024, this is a year of of execution,\" GM's long-time chair and CEO said in a new episode of Yahoo Finance's Lead This Way. \"I think it's a big year.\"\n\nIt certainly feels like it on a rainy day in late January, just miles outside of Detroit.\n\nBarra spent half the day with me touring a new Warren, Mich., production facility that's hand-making $300,000 plus Cadillac Celestiq EVs, which can be customized down to the stitching on the seats. These are some of the most expensive automobiles GM has ever made, and they don't even have a gas tank.\n\nThe operation is impressively detailed from start to finish, as is the futuristic take on GM's famed luxury brand Cadillac. General Motors chair and CEO Mary Barra tours an EV production facility in Warren, Mich., with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAs for the other part of the day, Barra took me for a spin in the new Corvette E-ray hybrid \u2014 the American icon's first hybrid.\n\nThe supercar features an electric motor paired with a rear mounted V8, giving it over 650 horsepower. Barra signed off on moving the engine from the front to rear several years back, to better compete on performance with the likes of Ferrari (RACE) and Lamborghini.\n\nA classic play from the Barra leadership playbook: bold, but respectful of GM's history.\n\n\"I can't take all the credit [for the engine move],\" Barra said from behind the wheel of the E-ray, heaping praise on the veteran gearheads in Corvette's development team.\n\nInside the leadership climb General Motors chair and CEO Mary Barra speaks to a team member inside its EV production facility in Warren, Mich. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nFollowing in her father's footsteps (he was a die maker at GM's now defunct Pontiac badge), Barra, 62, began her journey inspecting fenders at a Pontiac plant at age 18.\n\nShe went onto graduate from the General Motors Institute in 1985, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering.\n\nFrom there, her career path was as curvy as a country road \u2014 with stints in communications, marketing and manufacturing.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's these connections to the company's history and operations that have given Barra a lot of cred among the rank and file \u2014 something easily seen during our factory walk in Warren.\n\nAuto industry experts say Barra's intricate knowledge of GM's business has helped develop a balanced, gaffe-free leader that's widely respected.\n\n\"She's got a style of leadership that's a little bit maybe steadier and less prone to controversy than some of the others,\" senior news editor at Cox Automotive Sean Tucker tells Yahoo Finance. Mary Barra quote\n\nAltogether, Barra has drawn upon her rich experience to navigate a host of tricky situations since she was announced as CEO on December 10, 2013 \u2014 the first woman to hold the top spot at a Big Three automaker.\n\nThey have ranged from apologizing to victims of a faulty ignition switch early on in her tenure, to contending with a prickly President Trump tweeting about the company during COVID, to more recently dealing with UAW negotiations and an autonomous Cruise vehicle that fatally injured a pedestrian.\n\nEqually as tricky \u2014 pivoting GM to electric vehicles against a backdrop of range anxiety, fierce competition, and still relatively high prices for the technology. Between 2020 and 2025, GM plans to invest $35 billion in electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle product development, exceeding its gas and diesel spend.\n\nThe company plans to introduce the Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Equinox EV, Escalade IQ, and the Celestiq in 2024 alone, pushing to the forefront of the EV revolution. They join an EV lineup headlined currently by the Lyriq and Hummer.\n\nBarra had sought to be be all electric by 2035, but has since softened the stance amid industry-wide weakness in EV sales. The company will lean into the rising popularity of hybrids as a means to bridge the gap.\n\nGM is still targeting $280 billion in total sales by 2030 \u2014 more than double that of 2021 sales \u2014 in part due to expectations around EVs.\n\n\"We still believe in an all electric future,\" Barra said.\n\nUntil recently, the heavy belief and investment in electric has weighed on GM's stock price.\n\n\"I believe Mary has done a commendable job of laying the yellow brick road to growth, but execution has been choppy. This has been like pushing a boulder uphill, but the tide is starting to turn for GM in our view,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance.\n\nA drive down valuation lane\n\nDive into GM's valuation metrics on Yahoo Finance, and you can see that investors want to be shown that all of Barra's initiatives are paying off.\n\nGM\u2019s forward price-to-earnings multiple is a mere 4.3 times, a sizable discount to the S&P 500 index's 22 times. Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) forward PE ratio stands at a whopping 63 times.\n\nThe stock also trades at a 26% discount to its book value, according to Yahoo Finance calculations.\n\nTo be fair, the stock has come on of late due to several catalysts.\n\nFor one, GM unwrapped a $10 billion stock buyback plan, and tacked on a 33% dividend increase late in 2023. Barra told me at the time of the announcement she isn't happy with the stock price, so she and the management team are taking action to convey their confidence to investors.\n\nThen in February, GM said it sees \"variable\" EV profitability being achieved in the second half of 2024.\n\nFully-accounted profit is anticipated in 2025.\n\n\"They are going to be successful in EVs, I am fairly confident in that,\" Cox Automotive's Tucker says.\n\nWhatever ends up happening, one thing can't be denied \u2014 Barra's place in the auto leadership history books.\n\nBut ask Barra if she views herself as an iconic figure: \"No \u2014I feel very fortunate to be leading this team.\" Lead This Way\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 17 countries with the highest number of road traffic deaths. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Countries with the Highest Number of Road Traffic Deaths.\n\nAre Self Driving Vehicles Really That Safe?\n\nAccording to a report by the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association, autonomous vehicles have driven more than 44 million miles on public roads in the United States. By law, the AV industry must report any accidents to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The industry has been reporting accidents to the administration body for two years, and so far only one serious injury has been reported. Compared to these statistics, almost 43,000 human lives were lost in 2022, due to reckless driving by human drivers.\n\nAccording to a report by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the US reported 12.9 deaths per 100,000 people, and 1.37 traffic deaths per 100 million miles traveled. Rhode Island reported 5.7 and Mississippi reported 26.2 traffic deaths per 100,000 people. On the other hand, Massachusetts reported 0.71 and South Carolina reported 2.08 traffic deaths per 100 million miles traveled. 49% of the deaths in Rhode Island were of car owners, and 35% of deaths in Hawaii were of motorcyclists. You can also take a look at the countries with the most dangerous roads in the world.\n\nChina Making Strides to Improve Smart Transportation\n\nOn January 17, 2023, CGTN reported China's position on smart roads. China is home to a 157-kilometer highway expanding across Chengdu to Yibin, which is categorized as China's first \"total factor\" smart highway. The government has placed a smart pillar every 800 meters that provides road information to cars and drivers using radars and cameras.\n\nOn July 19, 2023, CGTN reported that China exported the world's first hydrogen-powered smart tram to Malaysia. The tram was produced in Zhuzhou by the China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC) Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Research Institute Co. The tram enjoys a long driving range, supports energy saving, and has a shorter refueling time.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn October 2, 2023, Reuters reported on China's commitment to push innovation in the self-driving industry by 2025. The country formed the Innovation Consortia to enable firms to learn from each other and celebrate technological advancements. According to the report, by the first half of 2023, 42% of passenger vehicles in China had already achieved level 2 of automated driving. The category supports self-driving functions, however, the driver must be ready to take over in case of emergency. The country is aiming to achieve level 3 of automation.\n\nTop Autonomous Vehicle Companies\n\nAlphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Waymo, General Motors Company's (NYSE:GM) subsidiary Cruise, and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) are among the leading autonomous vehicle producers in the world. Let's discuss recent updates and offerings from these companies.\u00a0 You can also take a look at best autonomous driving stocks to buy now.\n\nWaymo LLC, formerly known as Google Self-Driving Car Project, is owned by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The company is an autonomous driving technology company and is also home to Waymo One, the world's first autonomous ride-hailing service. It is functional in several cities across the United States. The cars are fully powered by renewable energy. On March 13, the company announced that it is set to launch Waymo One across two more cities in 2024. Waymo is currently testing the functionality of autonomous driving across 43 square miles of the city. During the testing phase, the company provides rides to its employees. As for Los Angeles, Waymo will first offer its services across 63 square miles of the city and will scale operations as time passes.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is a leading automotive company based in the United States. Cruise, a product of General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), is a big name in the autonomous vehicles market. According to a media report by Reuters, published on February 3, driverless vehicles in California drove 3.3 million miles in 2023. Of them, Waymo and Cruise accounted for 36% and 63% of the total miles driven. Cruise has recently been under the water for an accident. On November 8, 2023, Reuters reported that Cruise recalled 950 driverless vehicles from across the United States after one of its autonomous cars dragged a pedestrian in a crash. The cars were recalled because the company suspected that the autonomous driving software would respond differently to the crash resulting in more crashes. The company lost over $700 million in the third quarter, ultimately slashing its value by half. The company is now aiming to get back on the roads of the United States soon by trying to win back the trust of users. On March 25, Cruise published a statement regarding the incident that happened back in October 2023. The company announced that since the incident it has been establishing systems to improve safety. With improved efforts, the company aims to rebuild trust among stakeholders and customers.\n\nBaidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a leading technology company based in China.\u00a02023 has been huge for the company in the domain of autonomous vehicles. On March 17, 2023, the company received a permit to provide complete driverless ride-hailing services in Beijing, China. Previously, the company was not allowed to operate without human supervision.\u00a0Later that year, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) became the first company in China to launch driverless airport rides in Wuhan. These autonomous rides, by Apollo Go, are provided to and from the airport. The ride-hailing service, Apollo Go, connects urban roads and highways with its new airport service.\n\nNow that we have discussed the self-driving vehicle industry, let's take a look at the 17 countries with the highest number of road traffic deaths.

        "content": "On March 27th, Nissan Motor Co Ltd (OTC: NSANY) revealed it will be investing in Renault SA (OTC: RNLSY), more precisely, its EV unit Ampere. Interestingly, Nissan decided to deepen its partnership with Renault even after the French automaker ditched the unit\u2019s listing plans due to sluggish market conditions.\n\nReshaping The Longstanding Partnership With Renault\n\nRenault plans to sell a stake of about 2.5% in Nissan shares to the\u00a091-year-old\u00a0Japanese car maker, with the deal possibly could generating up to 362 million euros ($392 million). This is Renault\u2019s second share sale as it looks to cut its Nissan stake from about 43% to 15%, as Renault sold a 5% stake in Nissan back\u00a0to Nissan in December, as part of its share buyback program. The deal resolved the cause of long-term friction, along both automakers to move forward at a time of unparalleled changes as the industry undergoes its biggest transformation to date.\n\nBack in December, Nissan confirmed it plans to invest about 600 million euros in the unit, along with Mitsubishi who followed with 200 million. With the latest news, Renault and Nissan deepend their ties, with collaboration being in the industry's air as perhaps the best bet for surviving these uncertain times which will undoubtedly linger.\n\nNissan is evaluating a potential partnership with Honda.\n\nReuters reported that Nissan is evaluating a potential partnership with its Japanese peer Honda Motor Co Ltd (NYSE: HMC). In an effort to fight off its rivals in China, namely BYD Company Limited (OTC: BYDDY) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA),\u00a0Nissan is considering to join forces with Honda, according to Reuters. With Honda, Nissan could gain scalability which is key to facing off Tesla and BYD. Moreover, Reuters reported that the partnership would focus on key EV parts as well. Then again, Honda has an existing collaboration with General Motors (NYSE: GM) as it aims to expand its ratio of EVs and fuel cell vehicles to reach 100% of all sales by the end of 2040.\n\nStory continues\n\nNissan aims to restore its EV place with the Arc.\n\nNissan got cemented in the early days of EV history as an EV pioneer with its all-electric Leaf. But, a long has happened since as Nissan got overshadowed by its rivals such as Tesla and BYD, with emerging players coming at great speed.\u00a0CEO Makoto Uchida spoke of the need to shake things up as he announced the company\u2019s new business plan, The Arc. With the new strategy, Nissan aims to achieve some ambitious goals as it plans to launch 30 new models, out of which 16 will be electric by May 2027. By the end of the decade, Nissan aims to cover all segments of the EV market by launching another 18 models, aiming for a 60% model mix. Also, by investing more than\u00a0$2.6 billion in battery development, Nissan targets to lower the cost of next-generation EVs by 30%, which would bring them at par with their gas-powered counterparts by the end of the decade.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Hopping Into the 2nd Quarter With Key Interim Data Events",
        "content": "Markets are putting the finishing touches on the first quarter. Large-cap U.S. stocks have posted solid gains thus far, including upside participation from global equities. Domestic small caps have struggled, though, as the widely discussed higher for longer interest-rate narrative plays out. Following last week's Federal Reserve meeting and after robust economic growth trends over recent months, fewer cuts are priced into the bond market today compared to at the start of the year.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with TM.\n\nAt the firm-specific level, corporate earnings likewise appear strong. The fourth-quarter reporting season was better than expected, cementing an EPS recovery among S&P 500 companiess. With just two weeks to go from the kickoff of the first-quarter earnings season, how'd you like to get a jumpstart on key bellwether indicators and emerging narratives? Look to interim corporate event data for such insights.\n\nThere are few calendar stretches better than the here and now - as we hop into the second quarter. Nearly three months into 2024, executives have a sense of how the new year's trends are playing out while March's busy slate of conferences level-set expectations across industries.\n\nThis week, we cast the spotlight on four impactful dates that both macro investors and stockpickers should mark on their calendars before the all-important Q1 reporting period gets underway.\n\nMarch 28: Before the new quarter begins, global investors will receive key updates on March vehicle sales. A host of automakers, including Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), Honda Motor (NYSE:HMC), Subaru (TSE:7270), and Mazda (TSE:7261) will provide production and sales figures while some non-U.S. OEMs report export numbers. This will offer a glimpse into the dynamic new and used car market.\n\nCox Automotive reports that the total U.S. supply of available unsold new vehicles stood at 2.74 million units, a whopping increase from year-ago levels and higher than January's 2.61 million measure.[1] At 76 days' supply, dealerships indeed look swelled with inventory as consumers struggle with higher borrowing costs despite a still-healthy jobs market. Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) provide interim sales data the following week.\n\nStory continues\n\nApril 2: All eyes will be on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Tuesday next week as the embattled EV company provides vehicle production and delivery statistics. This is a quarterly update, so the report could drum up volatility in what was once a Magnificent Seven darling, now unofficially kicked out of the group of glamour stocks. Shares have rebounded modestly, though Elon Musk lost his title as the world's richest person earlier this month.[2]\n\nBack in January, Tesla reported fourth-quarter production of 495,000 vehicles and 484,000 deliveries. Full-year deliveries rose 38% to 1.81 million units with a 35% jump in production.[3] But with EV sticker prices in freefall, according to the latest Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, Tesla clearly faces headwinds.[4]\n\nApril 8: Shifting gears from EVs to fossil fuels, Shell PLC (NYSE:SHEL) is slated to provide its quarterly Update Note on first-quarter sales volumes and profit expectations. While the numbers may vary from its full earnings report confirmed to be released on Thursday, May 2 BMO, executives at the $213 billion market cap oil & gas behemoth must be pleased with the more than 15% year-to-date rally in WTI crude oil and 13% rise in Brent oil.[5]\n\nDespite the bullish run in black gold, shares of Shell are barely in the black thus far in 2024. If the Energy sector stalwart can offer solid quarterly numbers, perhaps Shell's underperformance to the commodity complex will reverse.\n\nApril 10: If you're itching for an AI update, look no further than Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) in two weeks. The semiconductor manufacturer issues its monthly sales report in the early hours on Wednesday, April 10.\n\nTSM's first-quarter earnings report then comes out on Thursday the following week. With a 30% gain on the year, Taiwan Semi is now the most valuable publicly traded company outside of the US.[6] Shares of the AI player have helped lift both the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) and the iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF (EWT) over recent months.[7]\n\nApril 10: Turning back stateside, we can always count on Costco (NASDAQ:COST) for a refresh on consumer happenings. Both the January and February Retail Sales reports released by the Census Bureau concerned strategists counting on robust consumer spending trends. While weather and seasonal adjustments in January were factors thought to have caused a slowdown in U.S. retail activity, the February report seemed to underscore that there is more caution in goods and services spending.[8] Of course, Costco caters to middle and upper-middle-income shoppers, so the monthly comp-store announcement won't be a holistic snapshot.

        "title": "General Motors Company (GM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "General Motors Company (GM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +9.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors falls in, has lost 5.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nGeneral Motors is expected to post earnings of $2.02 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9 points to a change of +17.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.13 indicates a change of +1.4% from what General Motors is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for General Motors.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of General Motors, the consensus sales estimate of $40.61 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.6%. The $174.98 billion and $175.94 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.8% and +0.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGeneral Motors reported revenues of $42.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $2.12 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.78 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.4%. The EPS surprise was +10.71%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGeneral Motors is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Hydrogen Stocks to Buy for the Next Bull Run: March 2024",
        "content": "Renewable energy stocks had a rough 2023. Between higher interest rates and a renewed focus on profitability, investors dumped a lot of more speculative stocks in the green energy space.\n\nThe selling was especially broad within the hydrogen category. For one stark example of that, consider the Global X Hydrogen ETF (NASDAQ:HYDR). It has lost 48% of its value over the past 12 months and close to 75% of its value since 2021.\n\nThis sort of volatility shouldn\u2019t be too shocking. Hydrogen is an emerging industry that is still in the early days of broad commercial adoption. And a lot of the pure-play hydrogen companies are still running large operating losses. However, after the huge drawdown in the hydrogen space, it could be a great time for investors to buy these three top hydrogen picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAir Products & Chemcials (APD) Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PA\n\nSource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.com\n\nAir Products & Chemicals (NYSE:APD) is a specialty chemical company that produces oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, helium and other such gases for a wide variety of commercial and industrial uses.\n\nAir Products & Chemicals operates across a wide range of verticals. However, the company is leaning more heavily into hydrogen nowadays thanks to the expanding market opportunity with that element. The company has sold hydrogen for more than\u00a060 years and has hydrogen operations in more than 20 countries today. It also operates the world\u2019s largest hydrogen distribution network. APD owns more than 100 hydrogen plants with a total capacity of around 7 million kilograms.\n\nAPD stock fell to new lows earlier this year on a disappointing earnings report. Indeed, the company has seen a near-term slowdown. But it is investing for the future with plans for $32 billion of new investments over the next decade. That is a massive number compared to the company\u2019s current $53 billion market cap. This should position Air Products & Chemicals for a major growth wave once hydrogen comes back into fashion.\n\nStory continues\n\nLinde (LIN) Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical company\n\nSource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.com\n\nLinde (NASDAQ:LIN) is another industrial gas and chemical company. Hailing from the U.K., it sells the standard range of atmospheric gasses. It also has another attractive line of business in building turnkey gas plants for customers.\n\nLinde is currently reporting\u00a0solid earnings. This has made Linde stand out from the pack as so many hydrogen and renewable energy stocks underperformed this past year. Linde, by contrast, is the model of consistency. Analysts are forecasting between 9% and 12% earnings per share growth for each of the next three years.\n\nLinde has demonstrated a consistent and repeatable pattern for successful growth. For example, the company is building out its own hydrogen production facilities, including a new\u00a0plant expansion in Alabama. In addition to its own operations, the third-party offerings allow Linde to cash in more broadly as the overall hydrogen industry continues to expand in size. While LIN stock is not the cheapest of the hydrogen names, its high-quality business and stable prospects make it a great blue-chip play within the industry.\n\nNel Asa (NLLSF) Hydrogen renewable energy production - hydrogen gas for clean electricity solar and wind turbine facility.\n\nSource: Audio und werbung / Shutterstock\n\nNel Asa (OTCMKTS:NLLSF) is a pure-play hydrogen company focused on\u00a0proton exchange membrane electrolysis\u00a0technologies. The company has partnered with prominent clients such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) to develop and commercialize its hydrogen offering.\n\nIn addition, Nel has benefitted from significant state backing. Earlier in March, Nel announced that it is receiving another $75 million from the state of Michigan in support of the company\u2019s planned factory in the Detroit area.\n\nNel has not yet reached profitability. However, it is getting closer to breakeven as it scales up. And the top-line is moving nicely. Nel produced 1.8 billion Norwegian Kroner of revenues in 2023, up from KR994 million in the prior year. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s EBITDA margin improved from -78% in 2022 to -27% in 2023.\n\nThis positive momentum, combined with continuing government support, gives Nel a shot at becoming a key piece of the hydrogen ecosystem going forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in APD stock.

        "content": "(Adds GM comments, details on port, VW saying it is not impacted)\n\nBy David Shepardson\n\nNEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - General Motors and Ford Motor will reroute affected shipments on Tuesday after a bridge collapse in the U.S. shuttered the Port of Baltimore, but the companies said the impact will be minimal.\n\n\"We expect the situation to have minimal impact to our operations. We are working to re-route any vehicle shipments to other ports,\" GM said in a statement.\n\nThe Port of Baltimore is the busiest U.S. port for car shipments, handling at least 750,000 vehicles in 2023, according to data from the Maryland Port Administration. Motor vehicles and parts accounted for 42% of all Baltimore port imports.\n\nFord Motor Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said on Tuesday the bridge collapse, which happened after a container ship smashed into the four-lane bridge early on Tuesday, will force the automaker to divert parts to other ports and impact its supply chain.\n\n\"It's going to have an impact,\" Lawler told Bloomberg News. \"We'll have to divert parts to other ports... It will probably lengthen the supply chain a bit.\" Ford told Reuters in a separate statement \"where workarounds are necessary in the short term, our team has already secured shipping alternatives.\"\n\nRescuers have pulled out two survivors, one of whom remains hospitalized, and were searching for more in the Patapsco River after huge spans of the 1.6-mile (2.57 km) Francis Scott Key Bridge crumpled into the water.\n\nVolkswagen Group of America said it was not impacted because its Baltimore facility is located on the easterly sea board of the bridge collapse.

        "content": "General Motors Company (GM) closed the most recent trading day at $43.55, moving +1.14% from the previous trading session. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.31%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.41%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.27%.\n\nThe company's shares have seen an increase of 8.66% over the last month, surpassing the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's loss of 1.25% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.05%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of General Motors Company in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $2.02, showcasing an 8.6% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $40.61 billion, indicating a 1.56% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $9 per share and a revenue of $174.98 billion, demonstrating changes of +17.19% and +1.83%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for General Motors Company. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

        "title": "Nissan's Expeditious Response To The Much Sooner Than Expected Developments Of The EV Evolution",
        "content": "While EV leaders Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) and BYD Company Limited (OTC: BYDDY), along with legacy automakers Ford Motor (NYSE: F), General Motors (NYSE: GM), and Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) brace for cooling EV demand by scaling back or delaying plans, Nissan Motor Co Ltd (OTC: NSANY) entered a new week by announcing the launch of 30 new models over the next three years, with 16 of them being electrified. The update to its medium-term business plan came as a response to addressing extreme market volatility, with the development of the EV industry and particularly the price pressures, coming in much sooner than expected.\n\nNissan President and CEO Makoto Uchida stated that\u00a0Nissan is now targeting to sell an additional 1 million vehicles by the end of fiscal year 2026, while also\u00a0aiming for\u00a0an operating profit margin of more than 6%\u00a0and\u00a0total shareholder returns of more than 30%\u00a0during the same timeframe which is the year ending in March 2027.\n\nCollaboration Is The Way Forward\n\nWhile focused on lowering costs by 30% until the end of the decade, Nissan will be\u00a0developing EVs in \u201cfamilies,\u201d by integrating powertrains and aiming to innovate the existing battery concept. Through smart partnerships, like the one that Nissan announced it is considering with its rival Honda Motor Co Ltd (NYSE: HMC), will help Nissan to deal with cut-throat competitors. Earlier in March, Reuters reported Nissan is considering a strategic partnership with Honda. Together, Nissan and Honda would collaborate to produce key EV components and develop AI in automotive software platforms. The potential partnership would help both Nissan and Honda achieve economies of scale as they are both threatened by BYD and Tesla.\n\nEveryone agrees that there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty.\n\nLike Tesla that braced for a notably lower growth rate, as well as GM, Ford and other automakers, Nissan agrees that the next five years will be filled with uncertainty. Even the resilient Chinese powerhouse, BYD, guided for a slower growth pace. Through collaborations, Nissan aims to address the challenges by achieving scalability, which Japan\u2019s third largest automaker by sales believes is key in overcoming the challenges that lie ahead. With its plan, titled the Arc, Nissan aims to ensure volume growth and prepare for an accelerated EV transition by balancing its portfolio between EV and combustion cars, while growing volumes in major markets and exercising financial discipline. Supported by smart partnerships, enhanced EV competitiveness, differentiated innovations and new revenue streams, Nissan expects the strategy to result in new business opportunities that will potentially bring in about $16 billion in revenue by fiscal year 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe often forget that Nissan is an EV pioneer like Tesla,\u00a0with its all-battery-powered Leaf that established the widespread acceptability of EVs. But Tesla, as well as BYD eclipsed its EV efforts. But, history does not have to repeat itself if Nissan learned from this experience as it aims to lay the foundation for long-term profitable growth with its undergoing strategy.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 15 least visited US national parks. If you would like to skip our discussion on the visitor trends, you can go to the 5 Least Visited US National Parks.\n\nThe US National Park System manages a total of 429 park sites across the country, with 63 of them designated with the official \"National Park\" title. Additionally, the system includes sites such as National Monuments, National Seashores, and National Historic Sites, among others. While many national parks are popular destinations for holidays, some remain relatively obscure due to their remote locations, making them less visited. The top 15 national parks collectively accounted for approximately 67% of visitor traffic in 2022, whereas the bottom 15 parks received only 1.73% of all visits. This disparity can be attributed to the geographical isolation and lack of tourist infrastructure in these lesser-known parks.\n\nThe purpose of safeguarding specific areas is to allow nature to flourish without human intervention. However, many individuals opt for less-populated national parks to escape the crowds and challenges associated with popular tourist destinations. Despite being equally stunning, these lesser-known parks are often more secluded. Among the least visited US national parks, three are located on remote islands, and five are in Alaska, making them difficult to access. However, for those in search of a tranquil vacation, these remote parks provide an ideal retreat. The National Park Foundation (NPF) depends on corporate partnerships to support the efforts of the National Park Service (NPS) in conserving vital historical sites and natural scenery. Popular companies like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) all act as NPF\u2019s corporate partners.\n\nThe National Park Service reported a total of 325.5 million recreational visits in 2023, marking a yearly increase of 13 million (4%) across all its sites. These national parks significantly impact state economies. For instance, the 2022-23 season played a vital role in Alaska's economy, with 2.7 million visitors between May 2022 and April 2023 spending approximately $3.9 billion. This spending supported 43,661 jobs and had a total economic impact of $5.6 billion. Of this, visits to the various national parks in Alaska contributed $1.16 billion from 2.023 million visitors in 2022. Indirectly, the NPS created 16,450 jobs and contributed $1.785 billion to the Alaskan economy. Comparatively, the most visited US national parks receive an average of three to four million visitors each year, highlighting the substantial difference in visitation compared to the entire state of Alaska.\n\nStory continues 15 Least Visited US National Parks\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile a list of the 15 least visited US national parks, we used the latest annual visitor data from the\u00a0National Park Service Database. The list includes only those parks that have been classified as \u201cNational Parks.\u201d The parks have been ranked in descending order of the annual number of visitors as of 2023.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "General Motors Company (GM) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of General Motors Company (GM)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 8.5% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $42.89 in the previous session. General Motors Company has gained 19.3% since the start of the year compared to the -6.4% move for the Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector and the -23.2% return for the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on January 30, 2024, General Motors reported EPS of $1.24 versus consensus estimate of $1.12 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 5.4%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, General Motors is expected to post earnings of $9 per share on $174.98 billion in revenues. This represents a 17.19% change in EPS on a 1.83% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $9.13 per share on $175.94 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 1.37% and 0.55%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nGeneral Motors may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nGeneral Motors has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are D and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 4.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 14.9X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 2.2X versus its peer group's average of 7.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.53. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, General Motors currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if General Motors fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though General Motors shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.\n\nHow Does GM Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of GM have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is PACCAR Inc. (PCAR). PCAR has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of C.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. PACCAR Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 22.73%, and for the current fiscal year, PCAR is expected to post earnings of $8.13 per share on revenue of $32.25 billion.\n\nShares of PACCAR Inc. have gained 11.8% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 14.93X and a P/CF of 10.64X.\n\nThe Automotive - Domestic industry is in the top 29% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for GM and PCAR, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Struggling Battery Factory Behind GM\u2019s Electric Vehicle Problems",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- General Motors Co. is racing to fix problems in its electric vehicle business to make good on promises Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra made five years ago. It still has a long way to go.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI Features Trump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New Team Musk Says His Ketamine Prescription Is in Investors\u2019 Best Interests Nvidia Unveils Successor to Its All-Conquering AI Processor Evergrande\u2019s Alleged $78 Billion Fraud Is Among Biggest Ever\n\nFresh off exiting major markets like Europe and India, Barra told GM employees in the spring of 2019 that the company was pivoting its strategy to bet heavily on EVs and self-driving cars. She wasn\u2019t content for the automaker to just survive the new technology-driven era for transportation; it needed to be a leader.\n\nThat transition has been fraught with delays, including automation issues and software glitches that caused the carmaker to miss its EV delivery targets the past two years. Getting the EV plants humming is Barra\u2019s last shot to take GM from a 20th-century metal-bender to a transportation company of the future.\n\nGM executives think they may be finally crawling out of their \u201cproduction hell\u201d phase, similar to the robotics problems that delayed Tesla Inc.\u2019s Model 3 seven years ago. GM aims to build 200,000 to 300,000 all-electric vehicles this year with its much-ballyhooed Ultium battery packs, about 20 times more than it made last year but still well short of its previous ambitions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some challenges scaling it,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said of the Ultium problems in a recent speech at an industry conference in Washington. \u201cI think most of those are behind us.\u201d\n\nInvestors say it\u2019s time for GM to prove it. The company sold fewer than 14,000 Ultium EVs all of last year, about as many as struggling startup Rivian Automotive Inc. delivered in just the fourth quarter. Since then, GM says it has doubled battery production at its Factory Zero plant in Detroit, but the company needs to expand much faster if it\u2019s going to meet its goals.\n\nStory continues\n\nFactory Zero is the auto industry\u2019s first attempt to scale up a fully automated assembly line with pouch-shaped battery cells. President Joe Biden lauded Barra\u2019s vision and the promise of US-built electric cars during a tour of the plant in November 2021. He even took a prototype electric Hummer for a test drive in the parking lot.\n\nGM bypassed its own best practices to rush the battery packs into production. Typically, when the company is preparing to build an all-new model, it sets up assembly-line equipment in a nearby supplier\u2019s warehouse for testing. Then, once the bugs are worked out, equipment is pulled up and moved to the assembly plant for production.\n\nGM skipped that step with Ultium, choosing to install new fully automated battery assembly lines right away rather than testing them elsewhere first, according to Mike Anderson, vice president of global electrification and battery systems.\n\nInside a fenced-in area at Factory Zero, robots stack battery cell pouches together six at a time, pressing them down like a panini and then placing four of the sandwich packs into a box with a cooling plate at the bottom. The cells must be pressed and packed precisely so the weld tabs that connect the modules fit through slots in the module box. If they don\u2019t line up exactly, the tabs will bend and the cell won\u2019t be linked with others. The battery will fail quality checks.\n\nTherefore, each time a cell\u2019s tab misses its slot in the box, engineers have to go inside the fence, find the problem and come up with a solution. That\u2019s a time-consuming and costly process, Anderson said.\n\nThe Detroit Fire Department says it\u2019s been called nine times to Factory Zero since August. The most recent was on Dec. 19, when a stack of EV batteries started to burn after a forklift pierced battery packs. In other incidents, fire fighters were called to investigate battery gas leaks as a safety precaution, according to a GM spokesman.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s more fires than anyone would want to see,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the growing pains.\u201d\n\nGM has brought in more battery experts, consultants and manufacturing executives to help fix the assembly problems. In February, the company hired former Tesla battery executive Kurt Kelty to run GM\u2019s battery operations. JP Clausen, who led the rapid scaling of EV propulsion systems at Tesla\u2019s factory in Nevada, was named GM\u2019s new head of manufacturing last week.\n\nAnderson said he thinks the company has \u201cturned the corner\u201d at Factory Zero and will continue to ramp up production en route to hitting GM\u2019s latest production targets. The company will employ what it learned there to a new battery plant in Tennessee, scheduled to open later this year, and other future sites.\n\nSoftware bugs have also delayed GM\u2019s EV ambitions. The Chevy Blazer EV was on hold for almost three months due to issues with GM\u2019s in-house infotainment software that is intended to replace Apple CarPlay and Google Android Auto. GM wants all vehicle software to be made in-house to better integrate it with the cars\u2019 hardware. After testing the vehicles over thousands more miles, the company said March 8 that it had fixed the software and would cut prices on the Blazer EV as sales resume.\n\n\u201cThey should be able to eventually solve the battery production problems, but GM is struggling to build the right organization to develop software,\u201d said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst with Guidehouse Insights. \u201cAt this point, you can\u2019t take GM at their word with Ultium EVs.\u201d\n\nGM isn\u2019t the only automaker struggling to accelerate EV production. Volkswagen AG also had buggy software in its cars. Wheels fell off Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s bZ4X. Ford Motor Co. last month halted production of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup due to quality issues.\n\nThe setbacks come at a difficult time for the industry when sales growth for electric cars is slowing globally due to high price tags and concerns about charging requirements. Manufacturing delays add further reputational risk for companies, especially among car shoppers considering buying an EV for the first time.\n\nGM is hedging its bets on EVs with a simultaneous reintroduction of plug-in hybrids in North America, a business that it left five years when it discontinued the Chevy Volt.\n\n\u201cThis is the Wild West,\u201d said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. \u201cEveryone is having a tough time.\u201d\n\nGM has a lot riding on EVs. Barra downsized GM\u2019s global business \u2014 ceding turf to Toyota and Volkswagen \u2014 in order to invest in EVs and self-driving cars. She had an ambitious plan to double revenue to $280 billion by the end of the decade by transforming GM into a tech company.\n\nThe Cruise robotaxi business is in shambles after a pedestrian accident and alleged coverup in California forced the company to ground its entire fleet.\n\nThere are also federal government subsidies at stake. The Inflation Reduction Act gives money to automakers for building EVs that meet certain production requirements. GM says it stands to get $3,500 to $5,500 in tax credits for every EV it makes under the Biden administration\u2019s policy. That equates as much as $1.65 billion if it reaches 300,000 EVs. The payments could balloon in coming years as the automaker aims to expand production capacity to 1 million EVs in 2026.\n\nBut GM fell well short of its goal of producing 150,000 EVs last year \u2014 half of which were to be Ultium-powered \u2014 and until recently had been targeting a cumulative total of 400,000 EVs by the middle of this year. Last year, most of its EV sales came from the now-discontinued Chevy Bolt. AutoForecast Solutions expects the company will only sell 112,000 battery-powered vehicles in 2024.\n\n\u201cBuyers just aren\u2019t lining up for these vehicles,\u201d Fiorani said. \u201cIf GM could make as many as they want, they might just end up competing on price with themselves.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Gabrielle Coppola.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina\u2019s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American Buyers Dollar\u2019s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and Abroad An Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of Trolls Women Are Closing the B-School Dean Gap Congress Should Think Bigger Than TikTok Ban, Tech Critics Say\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Old-Guard Car Stocks Are Hot Again as EV Revolution Sputters",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The Big Three are back, at least in the eyes of investors.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI Features Putin Warns Russia Won\u2019t Stop After Predictable Election Win Saudi Wealth Fund Is in Talks to Acquire National Airline Top Solar Firm Longi Plans Thousands of Job Cuts on Glut China\u2019s Growth Bump May Dent Urgency for More Stimulus\n\nAs the much-ballyhooed electric-vehicle revolution loses momentum, investors are reappraising the shares of legacy producers, with gasoline-powered cars and hybrids set to generate billions of dollars in cash for years to come and account for the vast majority of sales.\n\nShares of the legacy firms, shunned in recent years as the industry\u2019s past, are rising as EV stocks have tumbled, and Wall Street is jumping on board. Last week, a spate of analysts named General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis NV as the industry\u2019s likely winners with demand for EVs faltering.\n\nThe logic is that the steady profits from selling vehicles packing an internal combustion engine will provide a cushion that pure-play EV companies like Tesla Inc., Rivian Automotive Inc. and Lucid Group Inc. lack.\n\n\u201cThe old-school carmakers offer a significant valuation discount to EV stocks, so for investors looking at the EV winter it is a way to gain access to autos with a greater margin of safety,\u201d said Dave Mazza, chief strategy officer at Roundhill Investments. \u201cWhile the world may be all EV sooner than later, sooner isn\u2019t tomorrow and traditional autos may be cyclical but still around.\u201d\n\nUS-listed shares of Stellantis \u2014 which encompasses Chrysler, Fiat and Jeep among its many brands \u2014 have jumped 22% this year through last week, beating the 7.3% advance in the S&P 500 Index. GM has risen 13%, while Ford is largely flat. Meanwhile, Tesla shares have plunged 34%, and the money-losing Rivian and Lucid have slumped even more.\n\nAt $521 billion as of Friday\u2019s close, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization is less than half its 2021 peak. But it still dwarfs the roughly $185 billion combined value of GM, Ford and Stellantis.\n\nStory continues\n\nEV Shock\n\nThe cooling in the breakneck pace of EV sales since mid-2023 caught both carmakers and investors off guard. With EV companies trying to propel sales by lowering prices, their profit margins are eroding as well. Tesla has warned of a \u201cnotably lower\u201d rate of expansion, and Wall Street expects its annual profit to drop for a second straight year.\n\nWells Fargo analyst Colin Langan last week said Tesla\u2019s cash flow would turn negative if it slashes prices an additional 11%, after repeatedly lowering them across its global lineup since late 2022. The price of Tesla\u2019s top-selling car \u2014 the Model Y \u2014 has dropped 25% since the beginning of 2023, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nThe company last week said it will raise prices on the Model Y in April, a move that some investors hope will mark an end to the relentless cuts, even as others saw it as a way to boost sales in March. Tesla gained in early trading on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street\u2019s cash-flow projections for the legacy companies are rising, along with those for profit and revenue.\n\n\u201cWhile EVs are the future, it\u2019s the internal combustion engine product that generates the profits and funds the dividends and buybacks, while relatively insulated from Tesla and Chinese EV disruption,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a note last week.\n\nTop Choice\n\nJonas picked Ford as his top choice among US auto stocks, saying that after years of spending heavily on EVs and self-driving cars, these companies are now focusing on giving cash back to shareholders.\n\n\u201cIn a world of scarce capital and changing strategic priorities, we believe capital efficiency and cash return will be deterministic in driving share price performance for 2024,\u201d he wrote.\n\nGM, Ford and Stellantis spent a combined $22.7 billion repurchasing shares and paying dividends last year. Tesla doesn\u2019t pay a dividend and the chatter around a possible buyback that emerged back in 2022 has faded.\n\nThen there\u2019s the yawning gap in valuations.\n\nTesla trades at about 50 times forward earnings, a ratio that\u2019s steeper than even other mega-cap stocks. For GM, Ford and Stellantis, that number is in the mid-single digits.\n\nTesla may still expand at a faster rate than the legacy auto companies in the coming years. It also has another factor in its favor \u2014 the Biden administration is set to crack down on auto emissions to drive adoption of EVs.\n\nBut while Tesla\u2019s shares leave no room for error, those of the older firms reflect very little reward for any success.\n\n\u201cOn a relative valuation basis, traditional automakers remain attractive to EVs,\u201d Roundhill\u2019s Mazza said. \u201cFor years, investors bid up the price of EV companies because they had much higher growth. While the growth is still there, it is slowing and that\u2019s never good for any stock that\u2019s been valued on expectations materializing.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDollar\u2019s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and Abroad China\u2019s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American Buyers An Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of Trolls America\u2019s Plumber Deficit Isn\u2019t Good for the Economy Women Are Closing the B-School Dean Gap\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors alike.\n\nMany investors also have a go-to methodology that helps guide their buy and sell decisions. One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.\n\nIs This 1 Momentum Stock a Screaming Buy Right Now?\n\nFor momentum investors, upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook take precedent, so they'll want to zero in on the Momentum Style Score. This Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (GM)\n\nOne of the world\u2019s largest automakers, General Motors held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16.2% in 2023. Headquartered in Detroit, the auto giant has had a long and checkered history. Founded in 1908, the company rose to dominate the U.S. industry. However, hit by the financial crisis, General Motors filed for bankruptcy on Jun 1, 2009. Just within 40 days, the firm emerged from bankruptcy. In 2010, the company launched its IPO \u2013 the biggest in U.S. history at that time \u2013 and has been steadily profitable since then. From going bankrupt in 2009 to becoming one of the world\u2019s best-run car companies, General Motors has indeed come a long way.\n\nGM boasts a Momentum Style Score of A and VGM Score of A, and holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.

GM boasts an average earnings surprise of 20%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith strong earnings growth, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, investors should think about adding GM to their portfolios.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Should You Invest in General Motors Company (GM) Based on Bullish Wall Street Views?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about General Motors Company (GM).\n\nGeneral Motors Company currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.89, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 22 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.89 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 22 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 54.6% and 9.1% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for General Motors Company here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying General Motors Company, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs GM Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for General Motors Company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $9.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for General Motors Company. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for General Motors Company may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Fast-paced Momentum Stock General Motors Company (GM) Is Still Trading at a Bargain",
        "content": "Momentum investors typically don't time the market or \"buy low and sell high.\" In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that \"buying high and selling higher\" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.\n\nEveryone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.\n\nA safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (GM) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:\n\nA dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 5.1%, the stock of this company is certainly well-positioned in this regard.\n\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. GM meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 13% over the past 12 weeks.\n\nMoreover, the momentum for GM is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.5. This indicates that the stock moves 50% higher than the market in either direction.\n\nGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that GM has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped GM earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nMost importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, GM is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. GM is currently trading at 0.27 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 27 cents for each dollar of sales.\n\nSo, GM appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.\n\nIn addition to GM, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.\n\nThis is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

But hey, it wasn\u2019t all doom and gloom! Car and commercial vehicle sales hit a high of over 90 million with some impressive double-digit growth. India even stepped up to become the fourth-largest market for light vehicles. And despite a bit of a hiccup in electric vehicle sales, things are looking up for 2024.\n\nOver in the U.S., electric vehicle sales are set to rise by 16% year-over-year in 2024, while in China, we\u2019re looking at an 11.1% growth rate. China\u2019s leading the way in global electric vehicle sales, snagging a 60% share with their slick supply chains and top-notch innovation. They\u2019re on track to capture 12% of Europe\u2019s electric vehicle market by 2025. Luxury cars are shifting gears too, with SUVs becoming the hot choice for the wealthy. And electric vehicles are revving up their engines in the luxury market, aiming for 15-17% of sales by 2024.\n\nIn contrast, the used car market in the Asia-Pacific region is on a roll, with sales hitting 94-96 million vehicles in 2023 and expected to grow by 5-6% in 2024. The business-to-consumer segment is gaining ground, eyeing over 50% market share in Asia-Pacific and North America.

The project is getting a sweet $65 million budget boost, with $26 million chipped in by the DOE and the rest covered by GM and its partners. This move is tied to the SuperTruck program, a plan to cut carbon emissions from heavy- and medium-duty vehicles. Looks like GM is revving up innovation in the green vehicle game!\n\nVolkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY)\n\nVolkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) is a big German company behind all kinds of wheels - from cars to motorcycles and everything in between.

This boost won't change their 25% and 75% ownership stakes, though. Volkswagen's eyeing a comeback in the Chinese market after facing a bit of a setback with tensions between the West and Beijing. They're also feeling the heat to pull out of their Urumqi production site in Xinjiang. 15 Best Selling Car Brands in the World\n\nAn overhead view of a factory floor, teeming with robotic arms assembling cars.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of 15 Best Selling Car Brands in the World, we listed down the top-selling car brands of the world, as of 2024.

        "title": "Is Now The Time To Put General Motors (NYSE:GM) On Your Watchlist?",
        "content": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like General Motors (NYSE:GM). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for General Motors\n\nHow Quickly Is General Motors Increasing Earnings Per Share?\n\nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that General Motors has managed to grow EPS by 26% per year over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about. Getting in to the the finer details, it important to know that the EPS growth has been helped by share buybacks, demonstrating that the business is positioned to return capital to its shareholders.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Not all of General Motors' revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. On the revenue front, General Motors has done well over the past year, growing revenue by 9.6% to US$172b but EBIT margin figures were less stellar, seeing a decline over the last 12 months. So if EBIT margins can stabilize, this top-line growth should pay off for shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for General Motors.\n\nAre General Motors Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of General Motors, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$127m. This comes in at 0.3% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.\n\nShould You Add General Motors To Your Watchlist?\n\nIf you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into General Motors' strong EPS growth. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. We should say that we've discovered 3 warning signs for General Motors (2 don't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Hypergrowth Hitlist: 7 Stocks Primed to Skyrocket 100% in the Next 9 Months",
        "content": "Hypergrowth stocks provide some exciting opportunities for quick returns. Because growth stocks have a high-beta, opportunities are created in a correction or when the growth story faces near term headwinds.\n\nGrowth stocks with weak fundamentals might take time to recover. However, fundamentally strong growth stocks are unlikely to trade at a valuation gap for an extended period. With the possibility of rate cuts in the second half of 2024, there is a strong case for a rally in high-beta stocks.\n\nThis column discusses seven hypergrowth stocks that can surge by 100% before the end of 2024. These stocks represent ideas with potential company or industry specific catalysts that will play-out relatively soon.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that these hypergrowth stocks can be considered for the long-term portfolio. In my view, most of these stocks are poised for 3x to 5x returns in the next five years. Let\u2019s discuss the reasons that make these ideas attractive.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is a high conviction idea that\u2019s likely to skyrocket in the coming quarters. In the last six months, LI stock has remained sideways even as business developments have been stellar. The reason is a broad correction in Chinese equities. This looks like a golden accumulation opportunity with LI stock trading at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 18. Just to put things into perspective, Li is likely to deliver revenue growth of more than 100% this year.\n\nI would also like to add that Li commands a market valuation of $40 billion. For Q4 2023, the Company reported free cash flow of $2 billion. Considering the growth trajectory, the annual FCF is likely to be $10 billion for this year. Further, Li Auto has a cash buffer of $14.6 billion. Ultimately, it\u2019s the cash flows that determine the valuation. Considering the cash flow potential, LI stock looks massively undervalued. Earlier this month, Li Auto launched LI MEGA. The new model is likely to ensure stellar deliveries growth sustains in the coming quarters. This makes it one of those hypergrowth stocks to consider.\n\nStory continues\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) An image of a hand holding a cell phone with several visualizations of digital building blocks floating above it. representing sto platforms\n\nSource: Marko Aliaksandr/ShutterStock.com\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) seems to be marching towards $100,000 with halving due. While mining activity is likely to get difficult after halving, this factor is discounted in Bitcoin miners. Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) stock looks massively undervalued and 100% returns from current levels might be a cakewalk.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Riot is far from being a speculative stock. The Company has strong fundamentals with a zero-debt balance sheet. Further, as of Q4 2023, the Company\u2019s cash buffer was $908 million (including value of Bitcoin holdings). Therefore, financial flexibility is high to make aggressive capital investments.\n\nFor Q4 2023, Riot Platforms reported the cost to mine one Bitcoin at $13,674. With the crypto trading above $70,000, there is visibility for significant EBITDA margin expansion through the year. At the same time, Riot is planning to increase hash rate capacity from 12.4EH/s at the end of 2023 to 40.8EH/s by 2025. This will support healthy growth in EBITDA and cash flows.\n\nMiniso Group (MNSO) Explore the stock market trends for 2024 with analytical visuals of businessman planning long term investments and future business growth, Navigate towards success with smart strategies. growth stocks with millionaire potential\n\nSource: Thapana_Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMiniso Group (NYSE:MNSO) recently reported Q2 2024 results with revenue and earnings per share beating estimates. It\u2019s however worth noting that MNSO stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months. The growth stock looks deeply undervalued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 21.2. I would expect a strong breakout rally for this 2.26% dividend yield stock.\n\nFor Q2 2024, Miniso reported revenue growth of 54% on a year-on-year basis to $541 million. For the same period, adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.9%, which was higher by 200 basis points on a year-on-year basis. It\u2019s worth noting that Miniso has been consistently reported margin expansion.\n\nAnother highlight is that Miniso ended Q2 2024 with 6,413 stores globally. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, 298 new stores were added. Store expansion has been aggressive and provides visibility for growth in the coming quarters. Miniso also entered four new markets during the quarter. Therefore, with multiple growth catalysts, I am bullish on MNSO stock at current valuations.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) Lithium element on the periodic table. Top-rated lithium stocks\n\nSource: tunasalmon / Shutterstock\n\nEven with a strong rally in the recent past, Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) stock has lower by 10% for year-to-date. This does not come as a surprise with all lithium stocks being beaten down. However, LAC stock looks massively undervalued and looks set to surge higher.\n\nAnother reason to write now is a recent report that the Biden administration plans to lend $2 billion to the Company. The funding is likely to finance the construction of the lithium carbonate processing plant. If this news holds true, I would expect a significant rally in the coming months.\n\nTo remind investors, Lithium Americas is developing the Thacker Pass project in the U.S. The asset is believed to have the largest measured and indicated lithium resource in the country. General Motors (NYSE:GM) has also invested $650 million in two tranches towards project construction. With a mine life of 40 years and an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion, the asset is likely to be a game-changer for the Company. All in all, it\u2019s one of those hypergrowth stocks to buy.\n\nLundin Gold (LUGDF) Gold bars and Financial concept, studio shots. Costco's gold bars, cost stock\n\nSource: Misunseo / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith gold trending higher, it\u2019s a good time to remain invested in gold mining stocks. One name that\u2019s a hidden-gem from the industry is Lundin Gold (OTCMKTS:LUGDF).\n\nLUGDF stock has remained sideways for year-to-date and trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 17.1. Further, the stock offers a dividend yield of 3.18%. With gold trading near $2,200 an ounce, I expect the stock to go ballistic in the coming months.\n\nAs an overview, Lundin Gold owns the Fruta del Norte gold mine in southeast Ecuador. Further, the Company owns a large exploration land package that hosts the Fruta del Norte deposit at its northern edge. For 2023, Lundin Gold reported gold production of 481,274 ounces.\n\nFurther, at an average realized gold price of $1,958 an ounce, the Company reported operating cash flow of $519 million. With gold production guidance of 475,000 ounces for the year and significantly higher realized price, I expect OCF to increase significantly. This will provide Lundin Gold with the flexibility to increase dividends and invest aggressively in its exploration program.\n\nCoupang (CPNG) Coins stack of money on saving, the step of the financial stock market, graph and rows of coins, business investment on a green background, Economy stock market growth of financial recovery. Growth stocks\n\nSource: C H A L N / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the last one month, Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) stock has surged by 33%. The rally was on the back of strong Q4 2023 results. I believe that the strong upside momentum is likely to sustain for this attractively valued e-commerce stock. It\u2019s one of those hypergrowth stocks to buy.\n\nFor Q4 2023, Coupang reported revenue growth of 23% on a year-on-year basis to $6.6 billion. Besides healthy growth, there are two points to note. First, active customers increased by 16% on a year-on-year basis to 21 million. Further, average revenue per customer increased by 6% to $312.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Korean e-commerce market was worth $483 billion in 2023. The market is expected to increase to $563 billion by 2027. Therefore, there is ample scope for growth within Korea. Further, expansion in other Asian markets will help in accelerating top-line growth.\n\nAnother point to note is that for 2023, Coupang reported free cash flow of $1.8 billion. With robust FCF, the Company is positioned to make investments towards platform development and international expansion. I also expect EBITDA margin expansion in 2024 to support CPNG stock upside.\n\nTilray Brands (TLRY) marijuana stocks Hand gently holding rich soil for his marijuana plants. Cannabis Stocks\n\nSource: Jetacom Autofocus / Shutterstock.com\n\nTilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock has remained depressed for an extended period even with some positive business developments. I expect a big breakout on the upside from deeply undervalued levels.\n\nFor Q2 2024, Tilray reported record revenue of $194 million, which was higher by 34% on a year-on-year basis. A key highlight is the fact that international cannabis revenue increased by 55% on the back of medicinal cannabis sales. With a big addressable market, the medicinal cannabis segment is likely to be a key growth driver.\n\nFurther, Tilray reported beverage alcohol net revenue growth of 117% on a year-on-year basis to $47 million. With the Company being the fifth largest craft beer brewer in the United States, the new segment is likely to support growth.\n\nAnother reason to like Tilray is the upcoming Presidential elections. Any commitment related to federal level legalization of cannabis can send the stock skyrocketing. This makes it one of those hypergrowth stocks to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "General Motors Company (GM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "General Motors Company (GM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this company have returned +1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.3% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which General Motors Company belongs, has lost 11.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $2 per share, indicating a change of -9.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9 points to a change of +17.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.25 indicates a change of +2.8% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors Company is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $40.46 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $174.98 billion and $176.79 billion estimates indicate +1.8% and +1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $42.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $2.12 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.78 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.4%. The EPS surprise was +10.71%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGeneral Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "If any U.S. automaker is underappreciated right now, it\u2019s General Motors (NYSE:GM). The company grew its vehicle sales by 14.1% year over year in 2023. That\u2019s not too shabby \u2014 yet, GM stock is surprisingly cheap and value seekers should quit hesitating and start buying.\n\nBesides, General Motors is an audacious automaker with a multinational presence in the electric vehicle industry. In addition, General Motors is venturing into a software niche market that could prove lucrative. So, when everything is considered, it is a brilliant move to invest in General Motors in 2024.\n\nWhat\u2019s General Motors up to Now? You\u2019ll Be Surprised!\n\nGeneral Motors is an old company, but it continues to try out new concepts. For example, General Motors is teaming up with automotive supplier Magna and technology services and consulting company Wipro to develop an automotive software marketplace.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis digital marketplace will play the \u201cmatchmaker\u201d among automotive software buyers and sellers (primarily businesses, not individual consumers). It will be called SDVerse, and as I see it, this could be the equivalent of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for a niche industry.\n\nGeneral Motors is making headway in the market \u2014 not only in the U.S., but internationally. The automaker announced that General Motors\u2019 luxury-focused Cadillac Lyriq is again eligible for a $7,500 tax credit in the U.S. The Lyriq became eligible for the tax credit again after General Motors made a after a battery-sourcing change.\n\nIn addition, General Motors recently expanded into the European market when it unveiled the Lyriq in France. General Motors already offers the Lyriq in Switzerland. According to Reuters, General Motors \u201cis due to launch\u201d the Lyriq \u201cin other European markets, starting with Germany by year-end.\u201d\n\nGM Stock Is Too Cheap to Ignore\n\nThe market doesn\u2019t fully appreciate the growth potential of General Motors in the 2020s. While some other automakers have high valuation multiples, General Motors stock is an overlooked gem for bargain hunters.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeneral Motors CEO Mary Barra actually spoke upon this topic in a recent interview. \u201cA lot of companies have high price/earnings multiples based on what they are saying the future will be. We have to prove what our future will be, and that is what we have set out to do,\u201d Barra stated.\n\nIndeed, General Motors still has some proving to do in 2024. For the time being, though, General Motors has an ultralow GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 5.4x (versus the sector median P/E ratio of 17.83x). The automaker also has a non-GAAP forward P/E ratio of 4.45x (the sector median is 15.53x).\n\nDoes the market not know or care that General Motors was last year\u2019s\u00a0top-selling automaker in the U. S.? Perhaps, stock traders are so busy obsessing about the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that they just aren\u2019t aware of General Motors\u2019 supreme value.\n\nGM Stock: A Smart Play for Proud Cheapskates\n\nGeneral Motors isn\u2019t just a legacy automaker. The company is quite modern and ambitious as it expands its global EV-market presence and helps to develop an automotive software marketplace.\n\nGeneral Motors is a overlooked U.S. automotive-industry icon. Instead of just taking General Motors for granted, consider buying GM stock while it\u2019s still cheap. After all, cheapskates often get the best deals on Wall Street and book big profits in the long run.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Buy These 5 Stocks With Low P/B Ratio in March",
        "content": "When evaluating a company, investors mostly look at a stock\u2019s price to earnings (P/E) or price to sales (P/S) ratio. While P/E is the ratio of annual earnings to stock price, P/S reflects the amount investors pay for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.\n\nThough P/E and P/S valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.\n\nP/B is the ratio of stock price to book value.\n\nIt is calculated as below:\n\nP/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity\n\nThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company GM, Unum Group UNM, PVH Corp. PVH, Ford Motor Company F and Affiliated Managers Group AMG are some such stocks.\n\nNow, let us understand the concept of book value.\n\nWhat is Book Value?\n\nThere are several ways by which book value can be defined.\u00a0Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company\u2019s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.\n\nIt is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders\u2019 equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company\u2019s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.\n\nUnderstanding P/B Ratio\n\nBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.\n\nA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.\n\nBut there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock\u2019s price may be significantly high \u2014 thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one \u2014 in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.\n\nMoreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.\n\nIn any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.\n\nPrice to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company\u2019s sales/revenues \u2014 a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.\n\nPrice to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share \u2014 a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.\n\nPEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.\n\nCurrent Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\n\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\n\nValue Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.\n\nHere are five of the 11 picks that qualified the screening:\n\nHeadquartered in Detroit,\u00a0General Motors is one of the world\u2019s largest automakers.

        "title": "American drivers can't catch a break",
        "content": "If cruising the highway is an American birthright, it's also become an expensive one.\n\nThe cost of owning and operating a car has skyrocketed in the aftermath of the pandemic. And just as one element of car ownership has gotten more affordable, another is now wrecking the budget.\n\nThe latest pinch for drivers is the cost of auto insurance, which is up 20.6% year over year as of February and the biggest jump in the cost of car insurance in government data going back to 1985. It's also the biggest price jump for February in the 28 categories Yahoo Finance has been tracking since 2021.\n\nCar insurance doesn't get nearly as much attention as headline items such as food, gasoline, and rent.\n\nYet it's now one of the few spending categories keeping the overall rate of inflation stubbornly high.\n\nOverall inflation is down sharply from the peak of 9% in June 2022. But it ticked upward from 3.1% in January to 3.2% in February, causing fears that inflation may not be on the way out, after all.\n\nCar insurance accounts for 2.5% of the basket of goods and services the government measures when calculating the overall rate of inflation and is among categories counted towards the \"core\" inflation measure \u2014 which strips out food and energy \u2014 that the Federal Reserve keeps a close eye on. Core inflation rose 0.4% over the prior month in February and 3.8% over the prior year.\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nInsurance now costs the typical car owner $212 per month, or $2,545 per year, according to Bankrate.\n\nFor buyers who take out a loan, the typical monthly payment is about $530 for a used car and $740 for a new model. Insurance boosts the monthly cost of ownership by 25%-40%, money some buyers forget to account for when making a purchase.\n\nThe other thing keeping inflation high is the cost of housing, with the index for shelter, another element of core inflation, rising 5.7% year over year. Shelter costs, the BLS said, account for over two-thirds of the increase in core inflation over the last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther important items, however, are heading in the right direction, such as groceries, up just 1% year over year. And some things are actually getting cheaper, including appliances, electronics, and toys.\n\nNo single cause\n\nFrustratingly for consumers, there's no single cause for spiking insurance rates.\n\nCOVID-related supply chain challenges have created a shortage of new vehicles during the last few years, pushing up prices, which in turn pushes up the cost of repairs. Modern vehicles are also stuffed with electronics and other systems that make them costlier to fix.\n\nAmericans also appear to be driving faster, which makes crashes worse. All of this raises insurance costs.\n\nAnd as anybody who has tried to buy a car lately knows, this comes after a huge run-up in car prices that changed the affordability equation for many drivers.\n\nYear-over-year price hikes for new cars hit 13% in 2022 while used car inflation exceeded 40%. A shortage of semiconductors and other components slashed the output of new cars in 2021 and 2022, which pushed a lot of buyers into the used car market, accounting for unprecedented inflation.\n\nCar prices have moderated as supply shortages eased, but overall prices are still way higher than pre-COVID levels. New car prices are 21% higher than they were four years ago, right before the COVID outbreak. Used car prices are up 31%.\n\nThe average cost of a new car is now $47,401, according to Kelley Blue Book. The typical used car lists for nearly $26,000. A motorcyclist spits lanes as commuters sit in traffic on southbound Interstate 5 during the afternoon commute on Feb. 9, 2024, in San Diego, Calif. (Kevin Carter/Getty Images) (Kevin Carter via Getty Images)\n\nFueling a car is no bargain, either. Gasoline prices are down about 4% year over year to around $3.40 per gallon. But gas is still 32% more expensive than four years ago, and some drivers are still fuming about prices that hit $5 per gallon in 2022, the highest nominal price ever in the United States.\n\nThere are a few bright spots, especially for buyers who can afford to be patient, however.\n\nA glut of electric vehicles is causing double-digit price drops for some models, including Teslas, which seems likely to continue. Gas prices in 2024 could be a bit lower than in 2023. And transaction prices, though high, have dipped during the last few months, which should continue as automakers get back to more normal production levels.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights American Express, The Travelers Companies, Parker- Hannifin, General Motors and Colgate-Palmolive",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 12, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Express Co. AXP, The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV, Parker-Hannifin Corp. PH, General Motors Co.'s GM and Colgate-Palmolive Co. CL.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nForget A.I.: Invest in These 5 \"Old Economy\" Stocks\n\nU.S. stock markets have maintained their northward journey in 2024 after an astonishing rally in 2023. The bull run has gained further thrust as major stock indexes have posted multiple all-time highs on both intraday and closing basis so far this year. Year to date, the three major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite \u2014 have advanced 2.7%, 8% and 8.9%.\n\nHowever, the major driver of last year's and this year's rally was globally booming artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. Companies that have extensive application of AI in their final products have become multi-baggers in the past 15 months. Stock prices of some of these companies have skyrocketed 200-300% during this period.\n\nThese highly overvalued stocks make a large section of financial researchers and analysts skeptical of investing, although the near-term business outlook of these entities remains solid. The current overstretched valuation of these stocks makes them less attractive in the investing arena.\n\nMeanwhile, several old economy stocks from sectors such as industrials, finance, auto, materials and consumer defensive have popped year to date. Investing in these untapped stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should lead to profits.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five old economy stocks that have provided double-digit returns year to date and have more upside left. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmerican Express Co. has benefited from growth initiatives, such as launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances. Consumer spending on T&E, which carries higher margins for AXP, is advancing well. AXP's balance sheet looks strong with ample cash. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and dividends.\n\nAmerican Express has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.4% and 14.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days. The stock price of AXP has jumped 19.3% year to date.\n\nThe Travelers Companies Inc. boasts a strong market presence in auto, homeowners' insurance and commercial U.S. property-casualty insurance with solid inorganic growth. A high retention rate, a rise in new business and positive renewal premium change bode well.\n\nTRV's commercial businesses should perform well owing to market stability. TRV remains optimistic about the personal line of business, given growth at profitable agencies like auto and homeowners businesses. Strong and reliable returns from the growing fixed-income portfolio should drive net investment income. Sufficient capital boosts shareholder value. TRV aims for a mid-teens core return on equity over time.\n\nThe Travelers Companies has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.8% and 34.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last 30 days. The stock price of TRV has rallied 14.7% year to date.\n\nParker-Hannifin Corp. is benefiting from higher demand from distributors and end users across the oil and gas, material handling, cars and light trucks, and farm and agriculture markets in the North American region within the Diversified Industrial segment.\n\nHigher volume across all businesses, especially the commercial and military aftermarket businesses bolstered PH's Aerospace Systems unit. Synergies from the Meggitt buyout are also aiding PH. Benefits from the Win strategy are driving PH's margins.\n\nParker-Hannifin has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.5% and 11.7%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last seven days. The stock price of TRV has climbed 16.7% year to date.\n\nGeneral Motors Co.'s compelling electric vehicle (EV) and internal combustion engine portfolio, displaying strong demand for its quality pickups and SUVs, bodes well. GM retained the U.S. auto sales crown in 2023. Its massive EV push is commendable.\n\nGM plans to roll out 30 fresh EV models by 2025-end. General Motors' Ultium Drive system and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are likely to scale up its e-mobility prowess. GM is on track to deliver on its $2 billion net cost reduction program by 2024 end. Its superior liquidity profile and investor-friendly moves bode well.\n\nGeneral Motors has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 1.8% and 17.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.9% over the last 30 days. The stock price of GM has advanced 10% year to date.\n\nColgate-Palmolive Co. has been gaining from strong pricing, and the benefits of funding growth and other productivity efforts. This, along with solid business momentum, led to a robust performance during fourth-quarter 2023.\n\nIn addition, accelerated revenue growth management plans aided CL's organic sales in the fourth quarter. In fact, 2023 marked the fifth straight year of organic sales growth either in line or ahead of the 3-5% long-term goal. As a result, CL anticipates net sales growth of 1-4% for 2024.\n\nColgate-Palmolive has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 3.7% and 7.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last 30 days. The stock price of CL has appreciated 10.5% year to date.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "From Zero to Hero: 3 Auto Stocks Accelerating Out of a Slump",
        "content": "The automotive industry has been in a tough spot in recent years. Adoption of electric vehicles has slowed worldwide, China is in an economic funk that has hurt sales, and the major automakers in America endured a costly strike by their unionized workers last autumn.\n\nAt the same time, battery development and the public infrastructure needed to support electric vehicles have not moved at a pace fast enough to support the industry\u2019s ambitions. The end result is that the majority of automakers have seen their stocks steadily decline in recent years. Auto stocks have been among the worst investments since before the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020.\n\nThe good news is that we\u2019re starting to see a reversal, with many auto stocks having now bottomed and starting to rise again. Here is from zero to hero: three auto stocks accelerating out of a slump.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter a prolonged decline, the stock of General Motors (NYSE:GM) is up 10% so far in 2024. The reversal comes after a difficult strike last fall by the United Auto Workers (UAW) that saddled the Detroit automaker with an expensive new labor agreement. GM has done its best to put the strike behind it, announcing a strong earnings beat at the end of January and raising its quarterly dividend payment to stockholders by 33%.\n\nStarting this year, GM is paying a quarterly dividend of 12 cents a share. The company also announced that it will buy back $10 billion of its own stock over the coming year. The dividend hike and share buybacks come alongside better-than-expected earnings. For the final quarter of 2023, General Motors reported earnings of $1.24 a share on revenue of $42.98 billion. That best estimates of $1.16 a share and sales of $38.67 billion.\n\nWhile GM stock is rising currently, its share price is only up 4% through five years and looks cheap trading at just five times future earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nToyota Motor (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nFew if any companies have enjoyed as big a turnaround in their share price as Japanese automaker Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM). Since the start of the year, TM stock has gained 30%. That brings its increase over the past 12 months to 72%. That\u2019s a big turnaround for the world\u2019s largest vehicle manufacturer, whose stock had languished for years as investors and analysts worried aloud that the company was missing the electric vehicle revolution.\n\nThe spark that has lit a fire under TM stock was the company\u2019s announcement last year that it is going all-in on electrification of its fleet. Toyota has long been a leader in popular gas-electric hybrids but had been slow to introduce fully electric versions of its cars, trucks and SUVs. Not anymore. Toyota now plans to sell 3.5 million battery-powered vehicles a year by 2030. The new strategy has investors piling into TM stock.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.\n\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing some big issues. Rising competition, declining market share, price discounts, and quality issues are all weighing on the company\u2019s stock, which has fallen 30% so far in 2024. While the company has not accelerated out of its slump yet, it has been here before and always comes roaring back. Between September 2022 and January 2023, TSLA stock fell 63% before rising 149% over the next six months.\n\nCurrently trading at $175 a share, TSLA stock is starting to look both cheap and enticing as a buy-the-dip candidate. The median price target on the company\u2019s shares is 20% higher than current levels. The big question is whether Tesla can turn things around. Some analysts speculate that the company may move away from electric vehicles and into entirely new directions. Tesla is already developing supercomputers and robot assistants.\n\nWhile it is a gamble, history has shown that when TSLA stock turns, it turns quickly.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "17 European Countries with the Highest Unemployment Rates",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 17 European countries with the highest unemployment rates. We have also discussed the fluctuating unemployment rates in the EU zone in 2023. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 European Countries with the Highest Unemployment Rates.\n\nIn November 2023, the unemployment rates in Europe continued their downward trend, with the euro area at 6.4% and the EU at 5.9%. These figures represent a decline from the previous month and the same period in 2022. Eurostat data showed a decrease in the number of unemployed persons in both the EU and the euro area compared to October 2023 and November 2022, with 12.954 million individuals unemployed in the EU and 10.970 million in the euro area.\n\nYouth unemployment remained a concern, with 2.814 million young people unemployed in the EU, of which 2.321 million were in the euro area. Although the youth unemployment rate decreased slightly from the previous month, it saw an increase compared to November 2022. Unemployment rates for men and women showed slight variations, with women experiencing a slightly higher unemployment rate in both the EU and the euro area. It is worth noting that Luxembourg and Austria are countries with the low unemployment rates in Europe.\n\nDuring our research, we also observed the intricate dynamics of job creation and unemployment rates in Southern Europe, particularly in Portugal, Greece, Spain, and Italy. Despite a noticeable decrease in unemployment figures over the past decade, the underlying issues of job insecurity and low wages persist. Portugal, for instance, experienced a remarkable economic turnaround, with its unemployment rate dropping from a peak of 17.9% in 2013 to 6.6% by the end of 2023. Similarly, Greece saw a significant decrease from 27% in 2014 to below 10% presently. Italy recorded the creation of 456,000 jobs between 2022 and 2023, contributing to a decreased unemployment rate of 7.2% in December 2023. Spain also witnessed a noteworthy drop in unemployment, despite regional disparities, with the creation of 783,000 jobs in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, despite these positive trends, challenges such as regional disparities and inadequate training persist as there are disparities in unemployment rates across regions, such as 6.3% in Spain's Basque Country compared to 17.6% in Andalusia. Additionally, a major proportion of the population lacks adequate education, with over 35% of individuals in Portugal, Italy, Spain, and Greece having an education level below the baccalaureate. Furthermore, job insecurity remains prevalent, compounded by the acceptance of low wages. It is worth highlighting that Malta was the country with the lowest unemployment rate in Europe in 2023.\n\nWhile unemployment rates continue to fluctuate, key employers in Europe like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) are actively participating in the region to improve the economic and technological landscape in these countries.\n\nFor example, in response to the growing demand for cloud infrastructure in Europe, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is making major investments to expand its capabilities. This expansion includes bolstering infrastructure at both new and existing data centres, incorporating cutting-edge AI accelerators from industry leaders like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD, and optimizing networking and storage solutions for enhanced performance. With over 60 datacenter regions worldwide, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) boasts the largest global cloud footprint, ensuring that businesses can access high-capacity networking infrastructure while adhering to data residency and compliance requirements.\n\nEurope's dynamic economic landscape necessitates a robust cloud infrastructure that supports global scalability. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) investments in key European regions such as the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Germany underscore its commitment to providing customers with the necessary tools to harness the power of the cloud. These strategic expansions not only cater to burgeoning demand but also align with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0 sustainability goals, incorporating eco-friendly practices like free air cooling and renewable energy sources.\n\nChoosing the right cloud architecture is pivotal for organizations embarking on their digital transformation journey. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure offers a plethora of regions worldwide, allowing customers to optimize costs, meet regulatory requirements, and achieve business growth seamlessly. Leveraging frameworks like the Cloud Adoption Framework and the Well Architected Framework empowers organizations to build reliable, secure, and performant workloads while maximizing the value of their investment in Azure infrastructure.\n\nOn the other hand, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is making a bold return to the European market with the launch of its electric Cadillac, the Lyriq SUV. After maintaining a low profile in the region for several years, the automaker has announced that it will start taking orders for the battery electric Lyriq in Switzerland, with deliveries expected to commence in the first half of 2024. Over the next couple of years, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) plans to introduce electric models in Sweden, France, and three additional European countries. This move marks a major shift for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), which previously only imported a small number of vehicles into Europe and sold off its Opel and Vauxhall brands in 2017 to what is now Stellantis.\n\nThe Lyriq, powered by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)\u2019s Ultium batteries with an impressive estimated range of 530km per charge, will be priced competitively, starting at CHF82,000 (US$89,705), comparable to premium German electric SUVs. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)\u00a0 intends to sell its Cadillac EVs directly to European consumers through its websites and flagship stores, including one in downtown Zurich, importing the models from its US plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee. With plans to offer a complete range of fully electric models in Europe by the end of the decade, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is set to make a huge impact on the region's electric vehicle market. 17 European Countries with the Highest Unemployment Rates\n\nFEMA/ Michael Raphael\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the 17 European countries with the highest rates of unemployment, we utilized the unemployment rates provided by the World Bank, ensuring that the list is based on reliable and objective statistics. The unemployment rates were acquired from World Bank data for the year 2022, for all 17 European countries.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Particularly concerning was the youth unemployment rate, soaring to 18.3%, up by 6.4 percentage points. It is one of the places with the highest unemployment rate by country in 2023.\n\n15. Portugal\n\nUnemployment Rate: 6.0%\n\nAmidst fluctuations, Portugal's unemployment rate reached 6.5% in September, slightly up from the previous year, yet with record-high employment since 1998.

Slovak Republic\n\nUnemployment Rate: 6.1%\n\nThe unemployment rate in Slovak Republic was 6.1% in 2022. However, in January 2024, Slovakia's unemployment rate slightly increased to 3.97%, up by 0.09% from December 2023. but down by 0.47% from January 2023. Minister Erik Tomas noted the rate remains below 4%, indicating a a strong labor market, motivating continued efforts to assist job seekers.\n\n13. Finland\n\nUnemployment Rate: 6.7%\n\nWhile the unemployment rate in the country was 6.7% in 2022, Finland's unemployment rate continued to rise till the end of 2023, reaching 7.6% among 15-74-year-olds, with 26,000 more people jobless compared to November 2022. The economic downturn has affected various sectors, notably construction, facing a crisis. Economists attribute the recession to falling household consumption, declining business confidence, and tight monetary policies.\n\nIt is one of the countries with high levels of unemployment in Europe.\n\n12. Latvia\n\nUnemployment Rate: 6.8%\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Finance, Latvia anticipates a decrease in unemployment to 5% in the coming years. The abor market reflects the economic downturn's impact with a lag, evidenced by rising registered unemployment.\n\n11. Croatia\n\nUnemployment Rate: 7.0%\n\nIn January 2024, Croatia's registered unemployment rate rose to 6.8%, with 119,720 people registered as unemployed, marking a 4.1% increase from the previous month. However, there was a 2.2% decrease compared to the previous year.\n\n10. France\n\nUnemployment Rate: 7.3%\n\nIn France, inflation is on a downward trend while unemployment is steadily rising, echoing concerns about Europe's future. The inflation rate dropped to 4% in October from 4.9% in September, mainly due to reduced energy prices. Similarly, unemployment rose to 7.4% in Q3 2023 from 7.2% in Q2 2023, a concerning development blamed on the sluggish global economy. Analysts predict a gradual increase to 7.8% by 2025.

It is one of the countries with the highest unemployment rates in 2024.\n\n9.

Authors suggest that while Sweden's labor force grew by an average of 1.1% annually over the past decade, it will decline to 0.3% in the future due to lower demographic growth and shifts in the age composition of the population.\n\nIt is one of the countries where its easy for Americans to find a job.\n\n8.

Despite a drop in youth unemployment from 42.7% in 2014 to 21% in 2023, reforms like the Jobs Act failed to alleviate their plight. Introduced by Matteo Renzi, the Act relaxed labor market regulations, yet deepened young workers' economic insecurity. Flexible contracts dominate, with 38.2% of youth under temporary arrangements. Italy is one of the EU countries with the highest unemployment rates.\n\n7. Serbia\n\nUnemployment Rate: 8.7%\n\nIn Serbia, unemployment saw a slight increase to 9.1% in the fourth quarter of 2023, up from 9.0% in the previous quarter.

        "title": "'You can't just go to electric': Trump sounds off on EV transition as automakers warn on demand",
        "content": "If former President Donald Trump wins another term in November's election, Biden's electric vehicle policies could be tossed into the trash.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican nominee after Nikki Haley suspended her campaign last week, once again repeated his claims that EVs are not ready for prime time, and structural issues still exist for widespread adoption.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all for electric cars but you have to have all of the alternatives also,\u201d Trump said in an interview with CNBC on Monday morning. \u201cFirst of all they don\u2019t go far, they cost too much, and they\u2019re all going to be made in China.\u201d\n\nTrump has said in the past that EVs are a \u201choax\u201d and that an EV transformation will destroy the US auto industry and kill jobs. He has promised to reverse Biden's EV policies if he returns to office and he\u2019s now one step closer to doing so.\n\nTrump added some choice words for the people behind the \u201cBiden all-electric mandate\u201d in the CNBC interview, but he also voiced concerns over the infrastructure issues that exist in the US for an all-electric transformation.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just go to electric,\" Trump said, adding that the grid isn't up to the challenges of production and distribution.\n\nWhat this means for the auto sector \u2014 and EVs\n\nTrump is incorrect about criticism of the grid\u2019s electrical output, but his critique of the distribution of energy (i.e., charging) is a continued concern for drivers and automakers.\n\nIt\u2019s why the automakers are doing all they can to improve the infrastructure issue by joining forces with Tesla in one instance and starting their own joint venture to expand charging in another. Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks to guests during a campaign stop at Drake Enterprises, an automotive parts manufacturer, on Sept. 27, 2023, in Clinton Township, Mich. (Scott Olson/Getty Images) (Scott Olson via Getty Images)\n\nBut the distribution issues Trump cites would be largely problems caused by a Trump presidency in and of itself.\n\nThe biggest threat to the transformation is the cutting off of the federal spigot of funds for this key infrastructure \u2014 namely the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s federal EV tax credit and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\u2019s $7.5 billion earmarked to build an EV charger network. If Trump is successful in rolling back one or both of these landmark initiatives, an electric transformation in the US would be difficult to achieve.\n\nStory continues\n\nAutomakers are also seeing the writing on the wall coming from their own consumers, who echo some of the concerns Trump has with EVs.\n\nThe combination of high rates and serious price premiums over comparable gas-powered cars and hybrids has led to stalling sales. And now Ford, GM, and even Tesla are warning about the slumping demand continuing into 2024.\n\nTrump\u2019s desire to see more \u201calternatives\u201d is already happening because of this, with Ford pivoting deeper into its hybrids \u2014 the Maverick pickup and F-150 hybrids chief among them \u2014 and reports that GM is looking to add hybrids to its product portfolio ASAP. (It currently only has one: the Corvette E-Ray.)\n\nStellantis CEO Carlos Tavares told Yahoo Finance at a roundtable meeting last month that the automaker was already game-planning for either a Trump or a Biden election win, with \u201cmulti-energy platforms\u201d that can accommodate both fully electric or a more traditional gas-powered option with the same model. The upcoming Dodge Charger muscle car is an example of that strategy with two powertrains. Kevin Plank of Under Armour, Elon Musk of SpaceX, and Wendell P. Weeks of Corning listen to President Donald Trump during a meeting with business leaders in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Jan. 23, 2017, in Washington, D.C. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nAs for Tesla, going the hybrid route is not a possibility. But CEO Elon Musk still has a friend in the former president, at least for now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been friendly with him over the years, I\u2019ve helped [him] when I was president; I\u2019ve liked him,\u201d Trump said when asked about Musk and a meeting he had with the Tesla CEO at Mar-a-Lago this past weekend. \u201cWe obviously have opposing views on a minor subject I\u2019ll call electric cars.\u201d\n\nWhether Trump carves out some kind of special treatment for his friend Musk or maintains the EV tax credit for fully electric vehicles like those made in the US by Tesla is anyone\u2019s guess, but that scenario looks less and less likely as November approaches.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "The difference between a good company and a great one can be as small as admitting when you're wrong. It's all too common for companies to refuse to admit mistakes, or even double down on being wrong. That isn't the case with General Motors(NYSE: GM) after it originally planned to discontinue the Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle (EV). Armed with new information and changing consumer demand, the automaker adjusted its strategy, and it could end up paying off big.\n\nWhat's the story?\n\nOriginally, GM planned to send the Chevrolet Bolt off into the sunset to join a list of other discontinued models never to be seen again. The plan was to launch a list of newly designed EVs focused on entry-level segments.\n\nThe kicker was that this plan was going to cost around $5 billion, and considering all the pullbacks companies have done with their EV investments, GM decided to adjust its strategy. It decided it would rather revamp the Chevrolet Bolt EV rather than kill it off after 2023.\n\nBest of both worlds\n\nThe next-generation Chevrolet Bolt EV will be North America's first Ultium-based model to use lithium-iron phosphate battery cells (LFP). Beyond using its improved Ultium platform and freshest software, the Bolt will include charging ports that will enable it to use Tesla's Supercharger network.\n\nThe adjusted strategy will enable GM to get to market roughly two years faster and save the company billions, while offering a better driving, charging, and ownership experience, at a lower price point.\n\nIt couldn't come at a better time. The EV market appears saturated at high-end price points, with demand waning and customers pleading for more affordable EV options. Drastically reducing price points on EVs will be the next step to unlocking mainstream customer demand -- a point the industry desperately needs to reach.\n\nCross-town rival\n\nGM's revamped Bolt is expected to launch in 2025. That could not only prove important to reaching people wanting more affordable options, it could help fend off Ford Motor Company's (NYSE: F) secret gamble on developing a low-cost EV platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring Ford's fourth-quarter conference call, CEO Jim Farley noted that the company made a bet in silence two years ago to begin developing a low-cost EV platform, a project that was detached from Ford's main operations.\n\nIt's a move Ford is glad it made. The company lost roughly $47,000 per EV during Q4 2023, especially with an eye on cheaper Chinese models coming to compete sooner rather than later.\n\nIs GM a buy?\n\nGM has been doing a lot of things right over the past decade, but its struggles with driverless tech ambitions and Cruise, along with waning EV industry demand, has sent its stock price to a paltry price-to-earnings ratio of 5.4 times.\n\nIf GM continues to drive profits through its traditional business dominated by trucks and SUVs, while restarting its Cruise operations, and the Bolt provides a welcomed jolt to its EV sales, it could prove a great buy at these levels for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in General Motors right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in General Motors, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and General Motors wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "U.S. stock markets have maintained their northward journey in 2024 after an astonishing rally in 2023. The bull run has gained further thrust as major stock indexes have posted multiple all-time highs on both intraday and closing basis so far this year. Year to date, the three major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite \u2014 have advanced 2.7%, 8% and 8.9%.\n\nHowever, the major driver of last year\u2019s and this year\u2019s rally was globally booming artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. Companies that have extensive application of AI in their final products have become multi-baggers in the past 15 months. Stock prices of some of these companies have skyrocketed 200-300% during this period.\n\nThese highly overvalued stocks make a large section of financial researchers and analysts skeptical of investing, although the near-term business outlook of these entities remains solid. The current overstretched valuation of these stocks makes them less attractive in the investing arena.\n\nMeanwhile, several old economy stocks from sectors such as industrials, finance, auto, materials and consumer defensive have popped year to date. Investing in these untapped stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should lead to profits.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five old economy stocks that have provided double-digit returns year to date and have more upside left. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmerican Express Co.

Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and dividends.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmerican Express has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.4% and 14.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days. The stock price of AXP has jumped 19.3% year to date.\n\nThe Travelers Companies Inc. TRV boasts a strong market presence in auto, homeowners\u2019 insurance and commercial U.S. property-casualty insurance with solid inorganic growth. A high retention rate, a rise in new business and positive renewal premium change bode well.\n\nTRV\u2019s commercial businesses should perform well owing to market stability. TRV remains optimistic about the personal line of business, given growth at profitable agencies like auto and homeowners businesses.

Synergies from the Meggitt buyout are also aiding PH.

General Motors\u2019 Ultium Drive system and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are likely to scale up its e-mobility prowess. GM is on track to deliver on its $2 billion net cost reduction program by 2024 end.

        "title": "4 Low Price-to-Cash Flow Stocks to Garner Superior Returns",
        "content": "We always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style to be one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.\r\n\r\nThere are different valuation metrics to determine a stock\u2019s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company\u2019s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis \u2014 the lower the number, the better. General Motors Company GM, Unum Group UNM, Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. AMG and Corebridge Financial, Inc. CRBG boast a low P/CF ratio.\n\nPrice to Cash Flow Reveals Financial Health\n\nQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.\r\n\r\nAnalysts caution that a company\u2019s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.\r\n\r\nA positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company\u2019s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company\u2019s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat\u2019s the Best Strategy?\n\nAn investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.\r\n\r\nHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:\r\n\r\nP/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.\r\n\r\nPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\r\n\r\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\r\n\r\nP/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.\r\n\r\nP/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.\r\n\r\nP/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company\u2019s sales \u2014 the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.\r\n\r\nPEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\r\n\r\nValue Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.\r\n\r\nHere are four of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening.\r\n\r\nGeneral Motors, which designs, builds and sells cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts globally, carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 20%, on average. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors\u2019 current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 1.8% and 17.2%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers. General Motors has a Value Score of A. Shares of GM have risen 10.5% in the past year.\r\n\r\nUnum Group, an international provider of workplace benefits and services, carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.2%, on average.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Unum Group\u2019s current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 4.2% and 6.8%, respectively, from a year ago. Unum Group has a Value Score of A. Shares of UNM have gained 37.6% in the past year.\r\n\r\nAffiliated Managers Group, a New York City-based investment adviser and leading value investing firm, carries a Zacks Rank #2.

        "title": "General Motors (GM) Resumes Chevy Blazer EV Sales, Cuts Price",
        "content": "General Motors Company GM announced that it is reducing prices and restarting the sales of the Chevy Blazer EV following a halt in deliveries to address software issues.\r\n\r\nThe starting price of 2024 Blazer EV models will be $50,195, or $6,520 less than the initial price of the vehicle. The price excludes the $7,500 federal tax credit, for which the model is now completely eligible.\r\n\r\nFollowing the issues reported by vehicle owners and media about the car\u2019s infotainment and charging systems, the automaker halted the deliveries of the model.\r\n\r\nPer Baris Cetinok, the vice president of product, software and service at GM, all the issues were concerned with the vehicle\u2019s software and were addressed without making any physical changes to the model. Some reported issues included small bugs in coding and the vehicle\u2019s ability to communicate with public EV chargers.\r\n\r\nThere is not a single predominant root cause responsible for all these issues, Cetinok explained during an interview with CNBC. It's a convergence of circumstances and rare instances. Cetinok noted that while many issues were rare, they remained disruptive nonetheless.\r\n\r\nGM implemented the stop-sale to prevent further issues for its customers. The automaker carried out comprehensive \"testing matrix,\" which involved rewriting the code repeatedly and testing it. It also carried out physical on-road testing across the country.\r\n\r\nPer the automaker, the Blazer EV fixing processes have helped the company improve its software quality validation testing for upcoming vehicles.\r\n\r\nBesides fixing the software issues, the automaker added or altered some features on early customer feedback, including customizable multicolor ambient lighting and a modified driver infographic system.\r\n\r\nCetinok said General Motors has no plans to restore Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in the Blazer or future vehicles. GM\u2019s existing programs that communicate with the vehicle\u2019s internal system deliver a better customer experience and offer more functionalities than a third-party add.\r\n\r\nLast year, the company garnered attention when it announced that its future EVs would forgo features that replicate smartphone functions, such as navigation and music, in favor of integration into the model's infotainment system.\r\n\r\nThis vertical integration strategy is also anticipated to enable GM to generate revenues from potential infotainment subscriptions and services. In October 2021, GM projected annual software and services revenues in the range of $20-$25 billion, with an estimated 30 million connected vehicles by the end of the decade.\r\n\r\nThe starting price of costly Blazer EV RS models will be reduced to $54,595 for all-wheel drive, or $56,170 for rear-wheel drive.\r\n\r\nThe prices for other models, including a sub-$50,000 trim, will be disclosed when the vehicles go on sale later this year. The automaker changed material sourcing to make the vehicle fully eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit.\r\n\r\nThe prices of EVs have been one of the reasons that hampered its adoption. Just a few months ago, EV-maker reported a slower-than-expected EV sales. The recent price cut brings the vehicle closer to the prices of the gas-powered Blazer, which has a starting price in the range of $37,000-$48,000.\r\n\r\nSome other automakers, including Ford, have also reduced prices of EVs recently. The EVs that have regained eligibility for tax credits this year include Volkswagen ID.4, Nissan Leaf, Honda Prologue and Cadillac Lyriq.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Other Key Picks\n\nGM currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nSome other top-ranked players in the auto space are Modine Manufacturing Company MOD, Toyota Motor Corporation TM and Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc.

        "title": "The EV slowdown has already hit Tesla, Rivian, and others. These stocks are also casualties.",
        "content": "The fallout from a slowdown in EV demand continues to spread beyond just the makers of electric vehicles.\n\nOne group that has seen double-digit declines in the past 12 months is charging network stocks.\n\nShares of network operator Blink (BLNK) are down roughly 64% over the past year while charging hardware and software maker ChargePoint (CHPT) is 81% lower during the same period. Network owner and operator EVgo's (EVGO) stock is down 55% in the past year.\n\nAll are trading below their consensus target prices.\n\n\"Similar to the EV space as a whole, particularly in the last half of 2023, you saw the space come under pressure from a stock price perspective ... EV charging has had [a] similar performance,\" Brett Castelli, equity analyst at Morningstar, told Yahoo Finance. Castelli has a Hold rating on both charging stocks he covers, ChargePoint and EVgo.\n\nCharging network companies face a tough competitive landscape. EV giant Tesla (TSLA) continues to be a dominant player in the fast charger industry. Last year legacy automakers Ford (F) and GM (GM) agreed to use the company's electric vehicle charging network, putting pressure on shares of Blink, ChargePoint, and EVgo.\n\nAdding to investor concerns is that the smaller players in this market aren't fully profitable yet.\n\n\"The big picture on these stocks ... their business models are still at an earlier stage, and so the key focus for investors is really on proving out the business model and achieving profitability,\" Castelli said.\n\nEVgo expects to reach profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis in 2025 while ChargePoint anticipates reaching the threshold in the fourth quarter of this year. Blink Charing expects to be profitable on an adjusted basis by the end of 2024.\n\n'Build it and they will come'\n\nThe year-over-year plunge in these stocks comes as the electric vehicle industry has been aggressively working to address one of the challenges facing faster, broader adoption of EVs: range anxiety and too few charging stations.\n\nStory continues\n\nGovernment funding such as an estimated $5 billion from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program (NEVI) and incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act aim to expand the country's charging infrastructure to meet the Biden administration's goal for least 50% of vehicle sales to be electric by 2030.\n\n\"Tesla's supercharger network is the biggest game in town for fast charging. There's going to be a catch-up, though, in the coming years and a big part of the buildout of fast charging going forward is going to be from federal funds,\" said Castelli.\n\n\"There's a gold rush right now to capture these federal funds because it can cover a material part of the cost of a charging station. We're not talking 10%, we're talking half of a charging station cost,\" he added.\n\nThe number of EV charging stations in the US increased by nearly 24% last year, according to iSeeCars research. The study looked at the most charger-friendly states based on a ratio of residents per charging unit.\n\nVermont, California, and Massachusetts topped the friendliest states, while Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alaska were the least friendly states. The most improved state for charging friendliness was Connecticut, while Alaska took the spot for the least improved.\n\n\"The idea is: Build it and they will come,\" Ramanan Krishnamoorti, vice president for energy and innovation at the University of Houston, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"If you start to get the infrastructure in place, some of the biggest challenges that EV drivers face, which is range anxiety and charge access, starts to diminish,\" he said.\n\nImprovements in utilization\n\nOne positive sign for charging stocks long term is that utilization, which measures how often drivers charge their vehicles at the stations, is growing.\n\nEarlier this week EVgo stock soared more than 10% after the owner and operator of direct-current fast chargers reported its customer accounts jumped by 60% year over year and its top line almost tripled, most of it stemming from charging revenue.\n\n\"Our revenue is growing faster than the growth of EVs,\"EVgoCEO Badar Khan said during the company's earnings call on Wednesday.\n\nRideshare drivers are increasingly becoming a bigger mix of the fast charger customer base. Uber (UBER) is aiming to use electric vehicles for 100% of rides offered in the US by 2030. Meanwhile, New York City's Mayor Eric Adams recently outlined an initiative that requires all rideshare vehicles to be electric by the end of the decade.\n\n\"Rideshare drivers on average charge 5x more than our average retail customer,\" said Khan during the earnings call.\n\nOne industry tracker points to signs that the profitability goalpost for non-Tesla-operated networks could be close. Research from software startup Stable Auto, which tracks charging networks other than Tesla, shows growing utilization rates for direct-current fast chargers, or DCFCs.\n\n\u201cHistorically it was very much true that Tesla was the dominant player: more chargers, higher utilization rates, more vehicles,\" Rohan Puri, CEO of Stable Auto, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"What we\u2019re seeing now is there is utilization happening on non-Tesla locations which is getting pretty high too,\" he added.\n\n\"Utilization data reveals that DCFCs, once deemed poor investments due to low utilization, are now becoming profitable across many US states\" according to the research, which does not include Tesla superchargers.\n\nThe study shows charging stations across 19 states in the South, Southeast, and Northeast currently have a utilization rate greater than 15%, a threshold that indicates the likelihood of profitability. A couple of years ago, that stood at 4% to 5% on average, Puri said.\n\n\"The narrative that we've been seeing in slowing EV adoption seems to be different from what we're seeing in utilization rates. EV adoption maybe is slowing, but it's still growing enough that utilization rates are increasing,\" said Puri. Two Blink electric vehicle charging stations at an Ikea store in Houston.

        "title": "40 Most Polluted Cities in the World in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we list the 40 Most Polluted Cities in the World in 2024. If you would like to skip the complete list and our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go directly to 10 Most Polluted Cities in the World in 2024.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, global land waste is forecasted to increase to 3.4 billion tons by 2050. This alarmingly high number has raised many concerns amongst global leaders and local communities to strictly call for fixing the so-called \u201cthrowaway culture.\u201d\n\nThe throwaway culture is at large illuminated by industries that produce and dump substantial waste material into the soil, which increases land waste and also causes soil pollution. Similarly, the use of pesticides and nitrogen-based fertilizers in the agriculture industry and urbanization are also significantly contributing to soil pollution. Unfortunately, the efforts of just one country or a group of countries are not enough to fix this issue \u2014 a global problem requires a global solution. However, waste materials are not efficiently recycled, reused, or properly disposed of in many parts of the world despite the staggering statistics. Waste keeps piling up on the land, especially in low-income countries.\n\nOther forms of pollution are also peaking, like air pollution. Each year, around 7 million premature deaths occur due to the effects of ambient and household air pollution, WHO reports.\n\nEven worse is the fact that around 2.4 billion people worldwide are already exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution. In the United States, according to the American Lung Association\u2019s 2023 report, 119.6 million people live in places with unhealthy levels of air quality. As a result, people are prone to multiple health issues, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disease, and other long-term health issues like cancer. It\u2019s important to note that air quality deteriorates as a result of overall pollution, and not just air pollution.\n\nAir quality is measured and monitored using sensors that are designed to detect specific pollutants, such as PM2.5, PM10, ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide \u2014 those that impact human and environmental health overall. There are different methods of measuring these pollutants; some use satellite imaging to measure energy reflected or emitted by the Earth, while others use lasers to scan particulate matter density in a cubic meter of air.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe results are recorded on an air quality index (AQI), which is a scale ranging from 0 to 500 to measure the density of pollutants in the air. The higher the AQI score, the lesser the air quality. Air quality is unhealthy when it scores above 100 on the AQI. According to the UN Environment Programme and IQAir, only 38 of 117 countries and regions had AQI readings below 100 in 2021.\n\nPollution Vs. Global Corporations\n\nSince pollution is a major environmental concern, many global corporations such as JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ: JBLU), Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS), and General Motors Co (NYSE: GM) have taken steps to reduce their carbon footprint, which, in turn, will help better the overall air quality.\n\nJetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ: JBLU) announced in 2020 to use science-based emission reduction strategies to achieve a net zero carbon footprint by 2040. The strategies include transitioning to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), made from non-petroleum feedstocks, as an alternative fuel to reduce emissions. By 2035, JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ: JBLU) is committed to reducing jet fuel emissions by 50% per tonne-kilometer.\n\nSimilarly, Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) is also aiming to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2030. Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) has invested nearly $100 million in over 30 climate change and environmental sustainability projects. Moreover, its subsidiary company, Disney Cruise Line, has integrated its newest fleets with technologies and systems that improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.\n\nOn the other hand, by 2040, General Motors Co (NYSE: GM) aims to achieve carbon neutrality in global products and operations. In order to achieve this goal, General Motors Co (NYSE: GM) has set milestones and Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)-approved targets. By 2025, the company plans to scale its annual Electric Vehicles (EV) capacity to 1 million in North America and over 2 million globally.\n\nHere, we have listed the 40 most polluted cities in the world in 2024. 40 Most Polluted Cities in the World in 2024\n\n40 Most Polluted Cities in the World in 2024\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe have ranked the most polluted cities in the world based on the concentration of particulate matter (with an aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 2.5 \u03bcm). We sourced data from IQAir\u2019s ranking of the world\u2019s most polluted cities as well as AQI\u2019s ranking of the same. Note that according to WHO guidelines, the concentration of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 \u00b5g/m\u00b3. In both indexes, higher rankings have represented low levels of pollution, and vice versa. When we say rankings, we do not mean scores.\n\nFor our list, we have only considered cities that appeared in both these indexes, and to rank the cities, we have averaged their rankings. So, if a country ranked #1 in IQAir\u2019s index and ranked #3 in the AQI, it received a score of 2. Cities are listed in this article in ascending order of their average ranking scores. Note that we have considered the top 150 cities (most polluted ones) in both indexes.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best hot stocks to buy for March. If you want to skip our overview of the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Hot Stocks to Buy For March.\n\nThe stock market of 2024 is dominated by one key theme. If you haven't been following us regularly, then you'd have missed out on the fact that artificial intelligence, powered by the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the key factor on investors' minds when they look at major indexes such as the S&P 500 and the tech focused NASDAQ Composite. No one can blame them for this either, as after inflation and interest rates set records, 2024 has also been a record setting year for the stock market.\n\nThe artificial intelligence fueled mania, exacerbated by the earnings season in January that confirmed to investors that the demand for AI products was real and not just hype has pushed the S&P 500 index to cross the coveted 5,000 point mark for the first time in history. This comes after the NASDAQ's record setting spree last year and follows the second half of 2023 that had seen investors wonder whether the soaring S&P 500 in H1 2023 would continue its upward trajectory in the second half.\n\nThis surge in the stock market, even as the Federal Reserve remains worried about inflation, has made NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world and made it surpass the market volumes big ticket mega cap names the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The two are worth $1.8 trillion and $1.7 trillion, respectively, while NVIDIA's 64% rise year to date fueled by the firm's latest earnings release means that its latest market capitalization now sits at $1.97 trillion with trailing and forward price to earnings ratios of 66 and 33, respectively.\n\nYet, even though NVIDIA's shares take off and have no signs of looking back, the broader macroeconomic trends that shaped the stock market discourse in 2022 and 2023 are nevertheless still in play. Interest rates are still too high to be considered easy for business, and most investors expect that the first cuts will come in June - a percentage that increases for a July cut. The last week of February is also quite important because of the data that will become available. This will come in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index reading for January. The PCE is one of the most important data to judge the Fed's future actions since it is the central bank's preferred inflation metric. If officials believe that inflation is on a sufficiently downward trend to not raise its head again after an interest rate cut, then rates might start dropping before June. Should investors also read this conclusion, then the stock market should do well after the PCE data for January 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore we move forward to our latest collection of the best hot stocks to buy though, a recent report from the famed investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) merits a mention. Goldman was one of the few voices on Wall Street that bucked the trend in late 2022 and argued that avoiding a recession might be avoidable despite rapid central bank interest rate hikes. Now, the bank shares that during the week that ended on February 2023, hedge funds sold technology stocks at some of the highest rates for the past five years. It believes that software stocks were among the biggest losers, while bullish bets such as call options for NVIDIA's shares remain in play and suggest a hesitancy to completely go against technology stocks.\n\nSo, with Q1 2024 shaping up to be quite interesting, we decided to take a look at some hot stocks to buy. A couple of these are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Uber Technologies, Inc.

        "title": "Electric Pickups Are Getting Solar-Powered Accessories This Summer",
        "content": "This week, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) delivered some much-needed good news on the EV front after beginning the year by announcing it is scaling down its EV ambitions. Ford reported that its EV sales expanded across the board in February with sales of its electric F-150 pickup, the Lightning, almost doubling.\n\nEven the EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), acknowledged having difficulties in mass-producing its Cybertruck, after already having a hard time to bring it to the road. Moreover, the first EV maker to bring the electric truck to life, Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ: RIVN) projected a year without production growth. Beating Tesla by being the first to deliver the world\u2019s first electric pickup isn\u2019t enough as Rivian needs a home run. Rivian is betting its success\u00a0on a more affordable SUV. Rivian will be revealing its R2 SUV at an event in California today. According to the critics, a more affordable EV will either fuel Rivian to join the big EV league or potentially be the beginning of its end.\n\nAlso this week, Electrek reported that Nissan (OTC: NSANY) is reportedly in talks with EV maker Fisker to partner on electric pickups, but neither Nissan nor Fisker commented on the news that was first announced by Reuters, citing an unnamed source. The deal would certainly be a win-win for both Nissan and Fisker, with Fisker getting the cash-injection it desperately needs and Nissan gaining a window to boost its EV lineup with a pickup.\n\nThe above examples are merely a reflection of the complexities that come with developing electric pickups. But, as the technology continues to evolve, so does the EV evolution. Worksport Ltd. (NASDAQ: WKSP),specialized in truck beds and clean energy-powered automotive accessories, just revealed its revolutionary pickup power accessories, will be released this summer.\n\nA power duo that holds great promise for electric pickups.\n\nThis summer, Worksport will be releasing its SOLIS solar-powered tonneau cover and portable battery system COR, the latter even being independent of pickups.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe solar cover is expected to be available for major brands such as Ford, General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) and the Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF).\u00a0Moreover, as Tesla succeeds in mass producing its electrc pickup, even the Cybertruck would become an\u00a0ideal candidate for the Worksport SOLIS and COR power duo.\n\nThe prototypes of the SOLIS cover that are currently in development will be\u00a0tested on Hyundai, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis pickups, among other brands. Worksport's\u00a0existing hard-folding covers are compatible with Ford pickups, RAM and Jeep from Stellantis, GMC and Chevrolet brands from General Motors, as well as Nissan\u00a0and Toyota pickups. But with the COR that offers power-on-the-go without even needing a pickup, Worksport will be expanding its addressable market beyond 60 million pickup truck owners\u00a0to a global market of consumer electronics. With its revolutionary add-on power accessories, Worksport will be providing an unparalleled off-grid solution to pickup drivers, as well as to\u00a0all those who enjoy camping, remote work, sports and pretty much any outdoor activity.\n\n2023 was undoubtedly the year of electric pickups. Rivian kicked off the new pickup era with the R1T, then the America\u2019s best-selling Ford F-150 pickup got its electric sibling and Tesla\u2019s long awaited Cybertruck finally hit the road after many delays. But even the mighty Tesla still has challenges ahead in order to ramp up its production. Undoubtedly, more electric pickups are coming and although some could perish in the meantime, a revolutionary solar-powered tonneau cover and portable battery system are coming this summer.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Auto Giants Fuel Brazil's Green Transition With Billion-Dollar Bets",
        "content": "As Brazil steps on the gas to decarbonize the national fleet, auto giants are rapidly taking notice and making massive investment plans for the country. The most recent announcements have come from Stellantis STLA and Toyota TM. Just yesterday, Stellantis announced plans to invest 30 billion reais (more than $6 billion) in Brazil between 2025 and 2030 to develop flex-hybrid vehicles. The day before yesterday, Toyota confirmed an 11 billion reais (more than $2 billion) investment in the country through 2030 to rev up hybrid vehicle production.\n\nThe announcements by STLA and TM follow the multibillion-dollar investment plans of other automotive heavyweights like General Motors GM, Volkswagen VWAGY, BYD Co Ltd BYDDY and Hyundai. Before delving into the specifics of automakers' plans in Brazil, let's explore why these companies are pouring money into Latin America's largest economy.\n\nBrazil's Sustainable Mobility Agenda\n\nAutomakers are accelerating investments in Brazil amid the country's growing importance as a hub for automotive innovation and sustainability initiatives. The nation kicked off its National Green Mobility and Innovation Program (Mover) in 2024, aimed at reducing carbon emissions from the automotive fleet through tax incentives.\n\nThe Mover program will offer significant tax incentives to companies that invest in decarbonization efforts and meet sustainability requirements, fostering a conducive environment for automotive innovation. With 19.3 billion reais (close to $4 billion) allocated for tax incentives between 2024 and 2028, companies are motivated to adopt greener practices and develop environment-friendly vehicles.\n\nThe new guidelines established under the Mover program include mandates for fleet sustainability and incentives for the production of new technologies. By promoting investments in energy efficiency and setting higher sustainability standards, the government aims to position Brazil as a leader in green mobility and automotive innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Brazilian government's commitment to fostering innovation and modernization in the automotive sector has heralded a wave of investments lately. Multinational automakers have collectively pledged roughly 70 billion reais so far in 2024 toward various initiatives, many of which focus on the development of electric vehicles (EVs) or hybrids.\n\nAutomakers\u2019 Big Bets in Brazil\n\nStellantis' monumental R$30 billion investment represents the largest commitment ever made by an automaker in the Brazilian and South American automotive sectors. The funding will facilitate the launch of more than 40 new products between 2025 and 2030, alongside the development of cutting-edge Bio-Hybrid technologies and innovative decarbonization solutions across the automotive supply chain.\n\nThe company's inaugural flex-hybrid model is set to debut later this year as part of a broader initiative to unveil 40 new models by the decade's end. Stellantis' Bio-Hybrid technology will encompass three hybrid powertrains to be gradually introduced to the market, including Bio-Hybrid electrified dual-clutch transmissions (eDCT), Bio-Hybrid Plug-In and BEV (100% electric) variants, with availability expected by late 2024.\n\nThe latest investment plan of the Italian-American auto biggie aligns with its global commitment of \u20ac50 billion to electrification over the next decade, aiming for net zero carbon emissions by 2038.\n\nJapan\u2019s auto-titan, Toyota\u2019s R$11 billion investment plan for Brazil encompasses the production of new hybrid-flex vehicles and promises to generate 2,000 job opportunities. Of the total investment, 5 billion reais are earmarked for the production of a new compact hybrid-flex vehicle until 2026, with an additional 6 billion reais allocated for future projects until 2030. Alongside the new hybrid-flex model, Toyota plans to introduce another vehicle, specially tailored for the Brazilian market, although specific launch dates remain unconfirmed.\n\nThe company\u2019s expansion plans include upgrading factories in Porto Feliz to manufacture engines with hybrid systems by 2025 and Sorocaba to commence battery production by 2026. Meanwhile, operations from the Indaiatuba unit will transition to Sorocaba between 2025 and 2026 as part of this strategic investment initiative.Top of Form\n\nThis January, U.S. legacy automaker General Motors unveiled plans to invest 7 billion reais (more than $1.4 billion) in Brazil from 2024 to 2028, aimed at bolstering sustainable mobility. This initiative marks the initial phase of GM's new investment cycle in Brazil, focused on enhancing competitiveness and operational sustainability.\n\nThe funding will refresh the vehicle lineup, advance technological innovations and establish new ventures. GM's commitment solidifies its position as the third-largest seller of cars and light commercial vehicles in Brazil, commanding a 15% market share according to Brazilian car dealer association Fenabrave, trailing only Fiat and Volkswagen in sales volume at the end of 2023. Through this investment, GM aims to not only strengthen its market presence but also drive forward sustainable mobility solutions in Brazil.\n\nIn February, Germany-based auto bigwig Volkswagen pledged an additional 9 billion reais (over $1.8 billion) to its Brazilian operations over the next five years, unveiling plans to launch 16 new models, including hybrid and electric vehicles. This marked a significant expansion of Volkswagen's previous investment plan in Brazil, more than doubling it to 16 billion reais and facilitating the production of four additional models.\n\nAmong the new additions are Volkswagen's first domestically produced hybrids, a fully electric model and a pickup truck. The pickup truck will be manufactured in Parana state, while the remaining models and a new hybrid engine will be produced across factories in Sao Paulo state. Additionally, Volkswagen aims to enhance vehicle safety by developing an advanced driver assistance system. With an increase in 2023 market share to 15.8%, selling over 345,000 units, Volkswagen continues to solidify its presence in the Brazilian automotive market.\n\nAround three weeks following Volkswagen\u2019s investment announcement, South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Group unveiled plans to invest more than 5 billion reais (over $1.1 billion) in Brazil by 2032, to focus on advanced technology, particularly hybrid, electric, and green hydrogen cars. Hyundai currently operates a factory in Sao Paulo with an annual production capacity of 220,000 vehicles.\n\nThe company aims to establish itself as a premier EV brand in Brazil amid increasing competition in eco-friendly mobility. Notably, Hyundai Group will launch the Kia EV5, slated for mass production this year, and expand its Brazilian electrification lineup. It plans to develop a Brazil-optimized powertrain for hybrid Flexible-Fuel Vehicles, demonstrating its commitment to sustainable mobility solutions in the Brazilian market.\n\nChina's leading EV maker, BYD is also expanding its presence in Brazil. This week, the company commenced a 3 billion reais (more than $600 million) project to revamp an industrial complex formerly owned by Ford. Last year, BYD made headlines by selecting Brazil as the location for its inaugural factory outside of Asia.\n\nThe Brazilian complex is slated for completion by the end of 2024 or early 2025, with an anticipated annual production capacity of 150,000 units in its initial phase. Among the models to be manufactured are the Dolphin hatchback, Dolphin Mini, Song Plus SUV and Yuan Plus crossover. BYD's investment underscores Brazil's growing appeal as a strategic hub for electric vehicle production and highlights the company's commitment to expanding its global footprint.Top of Form\n\nLast Word\n\nAutomakers are accelerating investments in Brazil due to government-led initiatives, tax incentives and market demand for cleaner transportation solutions. With this, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's vision for a \u201cgreen\u201d industrial revival seems to be coming true. With a clear focus on sustainability and innovation, Brazil is poised to become a key player in the global automotive industry, attracting significant investments and driving the transition toward greener mobility solutions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We used this data to rank the countries that export the most cars in the world.\n\nPlease note that heading no. 8702 refers to \u201cVehicles; public transport passenger type\u201d, which are not to be confused with cars and are rightfully excluded.\n\nWe used data obtained for the year 2022 and ranked the countries based on the total value of their car exports. The 15 countries with the most car exports in the world are listed below in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

The platform, called SDVerse, aims to revolutionize the automotive software sourcing and procurement process by providing a matchmaking platform for buyers and sellers of embedded automotive software.\n\nUnlike the traditional captive software development approach, SDVerse focuses on connecting automotive software buyers and sellers through a transparent and efficient digital platform. Sellers can list their software\u2019s features and attributes, while buyers can easily search and explore the available software products through a comprehensive catalogue.\n\nSales and purchases can be connected directly through the platform, offering a seamless experience for all participants. SDVerse is currently in development and expected to feature hundreds of automotive software products, and participants from across the automotive value chain are invited to join. In addition to the founding members, an exclusive \u201cLaunch Partner\u201d group is already in place led by Ampere*, FEV, Forvia, HL Mando, NXP Semiconductors, TTTech Auto, and Valeo.\n\nPrashant Gulati has been named CEO of SDVerse effective March 5th, 2024. Prashant has more than two decades of experience launching and leading automotive organizations and is a thought leader in software technology, maximizing the potential of emerging technologies, such as AI, in the automotive industry.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe market for automotive software is expected to nearly double this decade, potentially outpacing the growth of software development talent pools,\u201d said Harmeet Chauhan, Global Head Wipro Engineering Edge, Wipro Limited. \u201cThe current paradigm for software sourcing will likely not be able to overcome this growing gap without sacrificing both profitability and the auto industry\u2019s aspirations for software defined vehicles. SDVerse addresses these pain points, offering a wide range of benefits across the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cAutomotive grade software development is rapidly transforming, and we all need to ask ourselves how we get customers really unique differentiating features faster. Part of that is identifying the common underlying code that can be shared in the name of higher quality and lower costs for our end customers,\u201d said Dan Nicholson, Vice President, Strategic Technology Initiatives, General Motors. \u201cThis first-ever software marketplace creates an independent, industry-driven one-stop-shop for embedded systems software, significantly expanding access to new innovations, helping to drive down cost, and allowing companies like GM to implement critical software more quickly.\u201d\n\n\u202aPotential key subscriber benefits of SDVerse include:\n\nReduced cost, time, and complexity, by eliminating duplication of efforts, enabling reuse of already-developed software, and allowing higher economies of scale by bundling software orders through multiple clients Higher quality of software, which has already undergone increased cycles of testing and validation. Additionally, the free-market approach improves customer vehicle quality through competition Improved resource allocation, which allows OEMs and suppliers to deploy engineering resources to innovate in areas that improve and differentiate driver and passenger experiences, and minimize time spent \u2018reinventing the wheel\u2019 Improved revenue for sellers, through an expanded client base and opportunities to monetize existing IP New approach to software sourcing, allowing companies to source software separately from hardware, and to create an attractive alternative to OEM insourcing of software development\n\n\u201cMagna\u2019s participation in SDVerse is driven by our ongoing commitment to foster collaboration and drive the automotive industry forward,\" said Joerg Grotendorst, Senior Vice President, Corporate R&D at Magna. \"By embracing this innovative platform, we aim to create a more interconnected ecosystem that encourages OEMs, suppliers, and specialty software developers to collaborate and co-create cutting-edge solutions. SDVerse represents a transformative opportunity to revolutionize software development, sales, and sourcing processes, ultimately accelerating the industry's transition to the software-defined vehicle.\"\n\nGM, Magna, and Wipro collectively designed and developed SDVerse, which will be governed collaboratively by the founding members. Global strategy consultant Roland Berger has served as the project\u2019s strategic advisor since the program\u2019s inception.\n\nKonstantin Shirokinskiy, Partner, Roland Berger added, \u201cSDVerse offers a blueprint for OEMs and suppliers to address their embedded software needs more efficiently. It frees up scarce software engineering resources required to roll out new differentiated software features, reorganizes development timelines to more quickly develop better SW-enabled vehicles, and ensures software is valued properly. Companies can streamline their operations, becoming more focused, efficient and profitable.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, April 4th, leaders from GM, Magna and Wipro will participate in a livestream panel discussion to provide further depth and insights into SDVerse.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search General Motors Company (GM): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "General Motors Company (GM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this company have returned +5.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.8% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which General Motors Company belongs, has gained 6.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $2 per share, indicating a change of -9.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9 points to a change of +17.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.25 indicates a change of +2.8% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for General Motors Company.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $40.46 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $174.98 billion and $176.79 billion estimates indicate +1.8% and +1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $42.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $2.12 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.78 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.4%. The EPS surprise was +10.71%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGeneral Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The peak for investing in EV stocks is far into the future, thus making these companies potentially lucrative investment options for discerning investors. Not only do these companies trade at attractive valuations, but robust free cash flow projections support their long-term outlooks, and many of them are gearing up for short-term profitability as well.\n\nEV stocks are here to stay despite their short-term weaknesses in deliveries. It\u2019s due to these short-term problems that I feel enhance their bull case even stronger. If investors only buy stocks when things are going well, they are, in effect, buying high and hoping to sell higher later. But scooping up shares of these companies when they are struggling sticks to the adage of buy low, sell high.\n\nSo, here are three EV stocks for investors to consider if one is seeking solid capital appreciation for this year. The names are fueling the wider EV revolution into the foreseeable future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on stock market. Tesla financial success and profit.\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) concluded 2023 on a high note, achieving record deliveries and surpassing its production goal of 1.8 million units. The company\u2019s outlook for 2024 includes the introduction of a rumored $25,000 vehicle, updates to the Model 3 and Model Y and increased production of the Cybertruck.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts predict a year of growth for Tesla in 2024 despite potential challenges. Dan Ives of Wedbush expects Tesla to introduce a sub-$30,000 vehicle while Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management suggests Tesla will maintain its dominant U.S. EV market share despite the competition from cheaper and mid-market Chinese EV companies.\n\nI agree with the other analysts here on TSLA stock. I think American-made Teslas will continue to maintain its dominance, at least partially because it is made on the soil of the U.S. The brand perception and quality of Teslas are unmistakable for many, and a cheaper competitor can\u2019t easily undercut that positioning.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logo\n\nSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is making substantial investments to pivot towards electric and autonomous vehicles and I think it\u2019s one of the more underrated picks in the industry that investors should have on their radars.\n\nThe company is targeting the manufacture of between 200,000 and 300,000 Ultium-based EVs in 2024 and further electrification efforts with a plan to launch 30 new EVs by 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2023, GM reported a 14.1% jump in sales to 2.6 million vehicles, marking its best year since 2019. The company also grew its market share in the United States. That positive momentum is supported by its forecast of total U.S. auto industry sales hitting 16 million in 2024.\n\nWith a P/E ratio of just five times sales, GM is one of those EV stocks that could be considered undervalued, especially if one finds the valuation of TSLA and the like too rich for their tastes.\n\nFord (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord (NYSE:F) Blue, the division responsible for gas and hybrid vehicles, reported an 8% revenue increase last year, outpacing wholesale growth, with hybrids making up 13% of Ford Blue\u2019s U.S. volume. It expects double-digit growth in this segment for 2024\n\nFor this year, Ford is optimistic, projecting an adjusted EBIT of $10 billion to $12 billion and aiming to generate $6 billion to $7 billion in adjusted free cash flow. That outlook is supported by overall lower vehicle pricing.\n\nHowever, in the EV space, it should be noted that Ford is a contrarian pick. Still, I believe it can turn its fortunes around. Its EV division reported a full-year EBIT loss of $4.7 billion for 2023. For 2024, wider losses are projected for the Model E unit, with an expected EBIT loss of $5 billion to $5.5 billion.\n\nF stock, therefore, trades at a deep discount, at six times forward earnings and just .28 times forward sales. Its stock price of $12.44 and dividend yield of 3.57% could make it a valuable wheel or covered call target for option writers, in addition to being one of those solid EV stocks to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 1, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are American Eagle Outfitters AEO, Central Garden & Pet Co. CENT, General Motors Co. GM, Vertiv Holdings Co. VRT and Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL.\n\n5 Solid Plays on the Relative Price Strength Trend\n\nWall Street continues its strong performance in 2024, building on its success from the previous year. So far this year, the benchmark S&P 500 index has risen more than 5%. The main reasons for this upward trend include expectations of interest rate cuts by the Fed, better-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter of 2023 and significant growth in artificial intelligence (AI) technology globally.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. economy remains robust, with the Department of Commerce reporting a growth rate of 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, surpassing the expected 2%. Overall, the GDP for the United States grew 2.5% in 2023 compared with 1.9% in 2022, exceeding initial estimates.\n\nGiven this positive outlook, savvy investors are focusing on relative price performance, strategically identifying and seizing promising opportunities that offer the potential for high returns.\n\nRelative Price Strength Strategy\n\nEarnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock's ability to offer considerable returns. But these are also essential for determining whether a stock's price performance is better than its peers or the industry average.\n\nIf a stock's performance is lacking that of the broader groups, despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples, then something must be wrong.\n\nIt's always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industry or benchmark. This is because betting on a winner always proves to be lucrative.\n\nThen again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter's (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.\n\nHere are five of the 20 stocks that made it through the screen:\n\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters: Based in Pittsburgh, PA, the company is a specialty retailer of casual apparel, accessories and footwear for men and women aged 15\u201325 years. AEO's expected EPS growth rate for three to five years is currently 21.5%, which compares favorably with the industry's growth rate of 12.7%. The company has a VGM Score of B.\n\nNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Eagle Outfitters' fiscal 2024 earnings per share indicates 45.4% year-over-year growth. The company has a market capitalization of $4.7 billion. AEO shares have gone up 66.5% in a year.\n\nCentral Garden & Pet Co.: It is one of the leading companies in the U.S. pet supplies and lawn and garden supplies space. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this firm's fiscal 2024 earnings indicates 7.3% year-over-year growth.

        "title": "13 Best EV Stocks To Buy in 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best EV stocks to buy in 2024. If you want to skip our introduction to the electric vehicle market and the latest news, then you can take a look at the 5 Best EV Stocks To Buy in 2024.\n\nIf there's one thing that can be said with certainty as well as settle into 2024, it's that the electric vehicle industry is a changed sector. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine took place in 2022, the clean energy sector that's led by electric vehicle firms such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), was an investor darling. Money, helped by record low interest rates, was piling into the sector as investors rushed to get an early spot inside the world's attempt to shift away from sooty fossil fuels into the new era of clean and renewable energy.\n\nHowever, since the invasion started, global macroeconomic conditions have meant that high growth and high risk sectors such as electric vehicle stocks are now facing an environment they haven't contended with before. Higher rates mean that investors demand more bang for the buck for their money, and EV stocks such as Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) are left at a disadvantage since they are in the early stages of their business expansion and therefore find it difficult to rake in bottom line profits. In fact, Lucid's shares are down by 62% over the past year as the luxury electric vehicle manufacturer finds itself facing the same set of manufacturing and production problems that Tesla had to face as it valiantly attempted to scale up production.\n\nWhile we'll get into some of the problems that electric vehicle stocks are facing in a bit, their turmoil aren't helped by the fact that consumers are growing wary of cars of a new kind that are still quite young when we consider the established nature of the internal combustion automobile industry. These problems were evident in a bombshell report by Consumer Reports that surveyed more than a quarter of a million EV users and found that vehicles, especially those that were launched over the past three years faced a stunning 79% more problems than a traditional car.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, what's troubling EV stocks these days? Well, the tighter financial conditions since the Russian invasion mean that consumers find it more difficult to finance pricey EV purchases, right at the time when car manufacturers have invested billions of dollars of capital in an industry that many believe does not have an upward limit to its demand. This was evident during the latest earnings call of the U.S. automotive giant General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), where management outlined that not only had EV demand slowed down, but that the firm might have to re divert resources back to making conventional cars.\n\nTalking about automotive giants, no analysis of the electric vehicle industry would be complete without looking at what the world's most valuable EV stock Tesla has been up to. These days, Tesla is embroiled in a fresh bout of controversy that has seen its chief Elon Musk vow to move the firm's incorporation out of Delaware after he was stripped of a massive $65 billion pay package. However, industry insiders believe that despite Musk rapidly calling for a vote to decide matters after he was denied the pay package, Tesla is yet to set the date for a shareholder vote since its board might not be adequately independent of Musk. When it comes to watching EV stocks, this particular news bite could very well prove to be a major catalyst (or otherwise) for Tesla's shares.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the best EV stocks to buy in 2024. Some notable names are Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM). 13 Best EV Stocks To Buy in 2024\n\nA brand new electric vehicle charging at a charging station with a city skyline in the background.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best EV stocks to buy in 2024, we ranked all companies directly engaged in electric vehicle manufacturing or provide important services to the industry by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q4 2023. Out of these, the top stocks were chosen.\n\nFor these best EV stocks, we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds' top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That's why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Best EV Stocks To Buy in 2024\n\n13. Fisker Inc.

(NYSE:FSR)'s shareholders. Along with Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), it is a great EV stock in 2024.\n\n12.

        "content": "Battery stocks fuel the green tech revolution, heralding an investment gold rush. They serve as the energy backbone for everything from vehicles to homes and offices while playing a critical in advancing the fast-growing electric vehicle (EV) sector. Consequently, battery technology has become a crucial element in modern investment strategy, positioning itself as a critical driver of future growth and sustainability.\n\nMoreover, battery stocks are primed for a resurgent comeback, with the gloomiest days of the stock market seemingly in the rearview mirror. Reinforcing this outlook, MarketsandMarkets predicts that the worldwide lithium market will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.1%, with an estimated valuation of $135 billion by 2031.\n\nWith such encouraging numbers, let\u2019s dive into the electrifying realm of these three stellar battery stocks as we accelerate into 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEnovix Corporation (ENVX) EV Battery Module for Automotive Industry on Production Line. Lithium-ion High-voltage Battery Component for Electric Vehicle or Hybrid Car. High Capacity Battery on Conveyor. Undervalued battery stocks\n\nSource: IM Imagery / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnovix Corporation (NASDAQ: ENVX) is revolutionizing the battery sphere, ushering in an era of rapid charging and enduring energy storage with its cutting-edge silicon-anode lithium-ion technology. In collaboration with Group14 Technologies, a leader in lithium-ion battery materials, ENVX is leading silicon battery innovation with its use of SCC55 for its anode. This silicon-carbon composite material made Time Magazine\u2019s200 Best Innovations list in 2022. The material significantly enhances performance and efficiency, highlighting Enovix\u2019s innovative approach toward advancing green energy solutions.\n\nMoreover, ENVX received clearance for the FDA-approved continuous blood pressure monitor, the Accurate Mini. Insight Partners projects the vital signs monitoring market to rise from $25.6 billion in 2022 to a whopping $66.8 billion by 2030, with an 8% CAGR.\n\nCelebrating a year of unprecedented success, ENVX reported a remarkable\u00a0fourth-quarter revenue surge to $7.4 million which beat estimates by a comfortable $3.96 million. Moreover, its massive sales growth represented a 575.3% bump on a year-over-year (YOY) basis underscoring its powerful positioning in its niche.\n\nStory continues\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) shines as a standout player in the lithium sphere, backed by its much-talked-about Thacker Pass project in Nevada. The project\u2019s feasibility study underscores its incredible potential, boasting an impressive 80,000 tons per annum of lithium carbonate equivalent and a substantial 40-year mine life. The sheer size of the Thacker Pass lithium deposit elevates LAC\u2019s position as a potentially key player with considerable global geopolitical significance.\n\nMoreover, General Motors\u2019 (NYSE:GM) strategic support adds another layer of strength to Thacker Pass, with a substantial $650 million investment and a ten-year offtake agreement, solidifying the project\u2019s financial viability.\n\nAugmenting this promising outlook for Lithium Americas is the projected average annual EBITDA of $1.1 billion, which sharply contrasts with its current market cap of roughly $743 million. This discrepancy between the company\u2019s valuation and expected EBITDA suggests that the stock is undervalued, making it an attractive investment proposition at this time.\n\nPanasonic Holdings (PCRFY) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing/Shutterstock.com\n\nPanasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS: PCRFY) takes center stage in the EV revolution, aligning its strategic focus with electrification and renewable energy solutions. Eyeing future growth, the firm plans to boost its battery capacity significantly to a remarkable 200 GWh by 2031. This forward-thinking move aims to propel sales growth and enhance cash flow, underscored by an exceptional portfolio boasting 445 solid-state battery patents.\n\nExecuting a systematic approach, Panasonic aims to achieve an EBITDA of approximately $1.36 billion by 2025, signaling a commitment to robust financial performance and environmental sustainability. This strategic goal is further supported by securing new contracts with Subaru and Mazda, expanding Panasonic\u2019s customer base beyond Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). This broadening of partnerships is critical, effectively reducing Panasonic\u2019s dependency on a single customer while reducing risks associated with market fluctuations.\n\nMoreover, this strategic diversification effort aligns with Wall Street analysts assigning PCRFY a \u2018strong buy\u2019 rating, reflecting a stellar 43.5% upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

Shares have added about 4.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is General Motors Company due for a pullback?

The bottom line, however, decreased from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level of $2.12. Revenues of $42.98 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.78 billion but decreased from $43.1 billion recorded in the year-ago period.\n\nThe U.S. auto giant recorded adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $1.75 billion, lower than $3.79 billion in the prior-year quarter. The automaker\u2019s share in the GM market was 8.5% in the reported quarter compared with 9.1% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nGM North America (\u201cGMNA\u201d) generated net revenues of $35.23 billion, down from $35.47 billion recorded in the corresponding period of 2022. However, the figure outpaced our model projection of $33.2 billion on higher-than-expected deliveries. Wholesale vehicle sales in the GMNA unit totaled 782,000 units, down from 787,000 units reported in the year-ago quarter. The figure, however, surpassed our estimate of 748,000 units. The segment\u2019s operating profit totaled $2.01 billion, down from $3.65 billion recorded in the year-earlier period. The metric also lagged our estimate of $2.66 billion due to EV inventory allowance adjustments and the strike\u2019s impact.\n\nGM International's (\u201cGMI\u201d) net revenues in the reported quarter amounted to $3.94 billion, down from the year-ago quarter\u2019s $4.32 billion. The metric also missed our estimate of $4.32 billion due to lower-than-expected deliveries. The segment\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales of 161,000 units decreased from 180,000 units in the year-ago quarter and also missed our projection of 176,000 units. GMI reported an operating profit of $269 million, which declined from the year-ago quarter's profit of $272 million and also lagged our estimate of $309.7 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nGM Financial generated net revenues of $3.74 billion in the quarter, up from $3.28 billion recorded in the year-ago period and ahead of our prediction of $3.2 billion. The segment recorded an EBIT-adjusted operating profit of $707 million, down from $775 million recorded in the year-ago period. The metric also missed our prediction of $726.8 million.\n\nGM Cruise recorded net revenues of $25 million in the fourth quarter, flat year over year. The metric came in line with our projection as well. The segment posted an operating loss of $792 million, wider than a loss of $524 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The reported loss also came in wider than our estimate of a loss of $610.4 million due to lower volume and mix.\n\nFinancial Position\n\nGeneral Motors had cash and cash equivalents of $18.85 billion as of Dec 31, 2023, compared with $19.15 billion as of Dec 31, 2022. The long-term automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $15.98 billion compared with $15.88 billion as of Dec 31, 2022.\n\nNet automotive cash provided by operating activities amounted to $4.66 billion during the quarter under review. The company recorded an adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.34 billion in fourth-quarter 2023, down from $4.46 billion recorded in the year-ago period.\n\nGM declared its first-quarter dividend of 12 cents per share, marking a 35% increase from the prior payout. The dividend will be paid on Mar 14, 2024, to shareholders as of Mar 1, 2024.\n\n2024 Guidance\n\nFor full-year 2024, GM expects adjusted EBIT in the range of $12-$14 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is anticipated in the range of $8.50-$9.50. Capex is predicted to be in the $10-$11 billion range. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is expected in the band of $8-$10 billion.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, estimates review have trended upward during the past month.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted 7.17% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, General Motors Company has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise General Motors Company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nGeneral Motors Company is part of the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry. Over the past month, Paccar (PCAR), a stock from the same industry, has gained 10.9%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended December 2023 more than a month ago.\n\nPaccar reported revenues of $8.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. EPS of $2.70 for the same period compares with $1.76 a year ago.\n\nPaccar is expected to post earnings of $2.13 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.9%.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Paccar. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of A.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Watching the electric vehicle (EV) market is like experiencing a slow-motion car wreck. Amid a dramatic slowdown in sales, companies are throwing in the towel. Mercedes-Benz (OTCMKTS:MBGAF) just scrapped its plans to go all-EV after 2030 while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just killed its electric car project.\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) previously backed off its pledge to be all-electric by 2035. Instead, it will bring back hybrid vehicles and see how EV demand pans out before committing more resources.\u00a0Similarly, Ford (NYSE:F) is delaying spending $12 billion on EVs and will also increase hybrid production.\n\nThere\u2019s carnage everywhere as Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) is near bankruptcy while Polestar Holding (NASDAQ:PSNY) staved off the same fate with a last-minute $1 billion lifeline.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe green future is looking blood red for EVs. Unfortunately, they ran into the wall of reality. Most car buyers don\u2019t want electric cars. They don\u2019t trust them enough to give up their gas-powered vehicles. From batteries bursting into flames to being unable to charge their cars in bone-chilling temperatures, most car buyers prefer the reliability of existing vehicles.\n\nThat\u2019s why there is only one EV stock to buy today and two that are must-sells now.\n\nEV Stock to Sell No. 1: Lucid Group (LCID) Closeup of the Lucid logo seen at a Lucid showroom in Millbrae, California. LCID stock.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nLucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) is one of those luxury EV makers swimming in red ink. It lost $2.8 billion last year or more than double the amount in 2022 as it sold fewer cars than the year before. The automaker may have just received a promise for $6 million from Michigan to site a non-production facility in the state but let the government throw tax dollars into that sinkhole. You don\u2019t have to follow suit.\n\nThe EV stock can\u2019t sell its cars. At $80,000 they are too expensive in a market that can\u2019t move EVs at half the price. And the introduction of a cheaper model won\u2019t help because it still costs more than the average new EV.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe electric car industry hoped that gaining price parity with gas-powered vehicles would be the tipping point for sales growth. The demand still hasn\u2019t materialized. Kelley Blue Book says a new EV averages $55,353, down 11% year over year. The average cost of a new car overall was $47,401, a 3% decline from last year. Despite the convergence, the rate of growth for new EVs stalled out. Just 1.8% more EVs were sold in 2023 than the year before.\n\nAlthough Lucid just dropped the base price of the Air by $8,000 to just under $70,000 because of falling demand it\u2019s still too expensive. And that\u2019s the third time in seven months it cut pricing. The EV maker says it will only produce 9,000 vehicles this year but even that might be too many. LCID stock is one to sell now.\n\nEV Stock to Sell No. 2: Rivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green color\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother luxury EV company trying to go down market is Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN). It is the second EV stock you should sell. Don\u2019t wait for the company to unveil its new lower-priced R2S SUV on Mar. 7 before selling. Get out now before more damage can be done.\n\nRivian\u2019s earnings were one of two data points I said investors should use to determine how RIVN stock would go. The financials were worse than expected. While the unveiling of the R2S was the second point to ponder, it\u2019s clear the automaker\u2019s position is too dire for a new model to matter. Even Elon Musk says bankruptcy is a likely outcome for Rivian.\n\nDespite reporting higher than expected revenue and a narrower loss for the fourth quarter, Rivian\u2019s outlook isn\u2019t bright. It is firing 10% of its workforce and forecasts it will produce only 57,000 vehicles this year. That\u2019s essentially flat compared to 2023 and far below the 80,000 expected.\n\nYet with EV sales growth tanking, that might be pie-in-the-sky thinking too. Rivian didn\u2019t announce any new price cuts and the R2S will be priced between $40,000 and $60,000. If it is not near the low price point it could be disastrous. With RIVN stock down 52% already in 2024 now is the time to cut losses and sell the stock.\n\nThe Only EV Stock to Buy: Toyota Motors (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nToyota Motors (NYSE:TM) has been one of the very few automakers showing any sort of common sense in the EV market. While the Japanese car company makes EVs, it didn\u2019t dive head-first into the shallow end of the pool like other automakers. EVs account for less than 1% of all vehicle sales at Toyota or a little more than 100,000 vehicles. More prevalent were hybrids, which represent almost 31%, or 3.6 million of the auto stock\u2019s total 11.2 million vehicles sold.\n\nToyota was skeptical of the headlong rush into all-electric cars and chose instead to focus on hybrids. It turns out the company was right. Car buyers are willing to look at alternative fuel vehicles so long as there is a backup plan in place. The hybrid vehicle gives buyers the assurance they won\u2019t be stuck if the green solution fails. Toyota chose to invest across the full spectrum of energy options and its profits doubled last quarter.\n\nThe Japanese automaker is the leading EV stock to buy today. Arguably, it\u2019s the only one. Even with TM stock up 30% year to date, it has such a clear lead over all its rivals in the hybrid space it is now the one to catch.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 29, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are General Motors Company GM, Unum Group UNM, Compa\u00f1\u00eda Cervecer\u00edas Unidas S. A. CCU, Owens Corning OC and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft DB.\n\n5 Low Price-to-Book Stock to Add to Your Kitty Now\n\nPrice-to-book ratio or P/B ratio is essentially the ratio of stock price to book value, i.e., how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the book value per share.\n\nIn value investing, it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong. There are a number of investment styles for finding great stocks at attractive values.\n\nWhile considering valuation metrics, though price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first choices, the P/B ratio is also emerging as a convenient tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.\n\nHere's the formula for P/B ratio:\n\nP/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.\n\nThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company, Unum Group, Compa\u00f1\u00eda Cervecer\u00edas Unidas S. A., Owens Corning and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft are some such stocks.\n\nNow, let us understand the concept of book value.\n\nWhat is Book Value?\n\nThere are several ways by which book value can be defined. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company's balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.\n\nIt is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders' equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company's balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnderstanding P/B Ratio\n\nBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.\n\nA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.\n\nFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.\n\nBut there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock's price may be significantly high \u2014 thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one \u2014 in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.\n\nMoreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.\n\nIn any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.\n\nHere are five of the 10 picks that qualified the screening:\n\nHeadquartered in Detroit, General Motors is one of the world's largest automakers.

Year to date, the three major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite \u2014 have advanced 3.3%, 6.9% and 8%, respectively.\n\nThe primary reasons for the northward journey so far this year are expectations of an interest rate cut by the Fed, better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2023 earnings and massive growth of generative artificial intelligence (AI) worldwide.\n\nConsequently, several stocks have rallied year to date even after skyrocketing in 2023. A few of these stocks are large-cap (market capital >$15 billion) U.S. stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. Moreover, a handful of stocks under this category currently enjoy strong potential for short-term price appreciation.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nBased on the abovementioned criteria, we have narrowed our search to five stocks with strong earnings growth potential for 2024.

        "title": "5 Solid Plays on the Relative Price Strength Trend",
        "content": "Wall Street continues its strong performance in 2024, building on its success from the previous year. So far this year, the benchmark S&P 500 index has risen more than 5%. The main reasons for this upward trend include expectations of interest rate cuts by the Fed, better-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter of 2023 and significant growth in artificial intelligence (AI) technology globally.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the U.S. economy remains robust, with the Department of Commerce reporting a growth rate of 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, surpassing the expected 2%. Overall, the GDP for the United States grew 2.5% in 2023 compared with 1.9% in 2022, exceeding initial estimates.\r\n\r\nGiven this positive outlook, savvy investors are focusing on relative price performance, strategically identifying and seizing promising opportunities that offer the potential for high returns.\n\nRelative Price Strength Strategy\n\nEarnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock's ability to offer considerable returns. But these are also essential for determining whether a stock\u2019s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average.\r\n \r\nIf a stock\u2019s performance is lacking that of the broader groups, despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples, then something must be wrong.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industry or benchmark. This is because betting on a winner always proves to be lucrative.\r\n\r\nThen again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter\u2019s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.\n\nStory continues\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nRelative % Price change \u2013 12 weeks greater than 0\r\n\r\nRelative % Price change \u2013 4 weeks greater than 0\r\n\r\nRelative % Price change \u2013 1 week greater than 0\r\n\r\n(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)\r\n\r\n% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks \u2014 that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years \u2014 can get through. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nCurrent Price greater than or equal to $5 and Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A minimum price of $5 is a good standard to screen low-priced stocks, while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity.\r\n\r\nVGM Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.\r\n\r\nHere are five of the 20 stocks that made it through the screen:\r\n\r\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters AEO: Based in Pittsburgh, PA, the company is a specialty retailer of casual apparel, accessories and footwear for men and women aged 15\u201325 years.

        "content": "Investors looking for stocks in the Automotive - Domestic sector might want to consider either General Motors Company (GM) or Fox Factory Holding (FOXF). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\n\nGeneral Motors Company has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Fox Factory Holding has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that GM has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\n\nGM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 4.46, while FOXF has a forward P/E of 20.92. We also note that GM has a PEG ratio of 0.49. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 4.26.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for GM is its P/B ratio of 0.68. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, FOXF has a P/B of 1.76.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to GM's Value grade of A and FOXF's Value grade of C.\n\nGM stands above FOXF thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that GM is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 15 best fuel-efficient cars under $30K. To skip the detailed analysis of the automotive industry, go directly to the 5 Best Fuel Efficient Cars Under $30K.\n\nThe automotive industry is changing rapidly due to the fast pace of technology growth. Over the last few years, oil and gas prices have been quite volatile, and there has been a growing trend of moving toward alternative fuel sources to power our vehicles. According to one of our reports from 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted 14 million electric vehicle (EV) sales in 2023. While the sales didn\u2019t exactly hit IEA\u2019s target, it certainly came close with 13.6 million EV sales worldwide. Reuters reported that EV sales growth was 31% in 2023, compared to 60% in 2022.\n\nIn the US, EV sales growth was quite significant, and a record 1.2 million units were sold in the country in 2023. The US also has one of the most extensive charging infrastructures in the world. By 2022, the US had installed 6,300 fast chargers, reaching a total of 28,000 by the end of the year, and in 2023, a plan for the installation of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers was announced by the government.\n\nThe slowdown in sales growth can be mainly attributed to the high interest rate environment and the high price of installing new technologies in the vehicles. Despite that, technological advancements such as autonomous driving and AI technologies developed by companies like Sensigo are expected to be quite beneficial for the industry. Sensigo is a California-based startup that uses artificial intelligence for car repair purposes.\n\nThe growth of the EV industry has provided many new companies to make a mark in the automotive industry. However, older and well-established companies like Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE:HMC), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) have entered the race to capture the EV market share. Additionally, these companies have also dominated the internal combustion engine (ICE) industry for years, which means they have loaded up on a lot of cash to make the transition toward the EV industry easier when the time is right.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to our previous report, the electric vehicles industry is expected to reach $1.57 trillion by 2030 and grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22.1%. These big names are already trying to carve out a big chunk of the market share. Furthermore, they are also producing vehicles that are pocket-friendly.\n\nThere are no better fuel-efficient cars than EVs and hybrids, but their price tag makes them harder to buy. There are 15 best fuel-efficient cars in our current list, yet we could have easily made a list for 30. Compared to that, there are only a handful of electric vehicles that fall at or under the price tag of $30k. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)\u2019s Chevrolet Bolt EV, Chevrolet Bolt EUV, and Chevrolet Equinox EV (base trim) have manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price (MSRP) of $30k or below, along with some other vehicles by Nissan and MINI. Additionally, Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE:HMC) and Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) are offering hybrid versions of their flagship vehicles that have a starting MSRP of just a little over $30K.\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) produces all-electric vehicles, which are some of the best fuel-efficient cars, and has cut down the price of its vehicles several times. People with the above-mentioned budget cannot afford any vehicle produced by the company. 15 Best Fuel Efficient Cars Under $30K\n\nAn auto warehouse filled with newly acquired used cars.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we made an extensive list of ICE cars with the MSRP of under $30k and then checked their fuel economy from several sources including their manufacturers' websites, the official US fuel economy information website, and several others. For each car\u2019s fuel economy information, we took a mean of the data we gathered from our sources. Our methodology is based on the reviews of several sources that authentically review vehicles. We avoided basing the methodology on reviews posted on public discussion forums such as Reddit because personal experiences of people vary from each other. For example, one individual mentioned that their Honda Civic averages 36 mpg while another person claimed that they managed to get 29 mpg. The difference was between their route and driving style.\n\nNext, we chose the 15 best fuel-efficient vehicles under $30k based on each car\u2019s combined fuel economy (highway and city) and price. For example, if two cars had a combined fuel economy of 31 miles per gallon, we chose the car with the lower starting MSRP. It is important to note that MSRP excludes tax, title, license, dealer fees, and optional equipment.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Add to Your Kitty Now",
        "content": "Price-to-book ratio or P/B ratio is essentially the ratio of stock price to book value, i.e., how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the book value per share.\n\nIn value investing, it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong. There are a number of investment styles for finding great stocks at attractive values.\n\nWhile considering valuation metrics, though price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first choices, the P/B ratio is also emerging as a convenient tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.\n\nHere\u2019s the formula for P/B ratio:\n\nP/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.\n\nThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company GM, Unum Group UNM, Compa\u00f1\u00eda Cervecer\u00edas Unidas S. A. CCU, Owens Corning OC and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft DB are some such stocks.\n\nNow, let us understand the concept of book value.\n\nWhat is Book Value?\n\nThere are several ways by which book value can be defined.\u00a0Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company\u2019s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.\n\nIt is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders\u2019 equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company\u2019s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.\n\nUnderstanding P/B Ratio\n\nBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.\n\nFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.\n\nBut there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock\u2019s price may be significantly high \u2014 thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one \u2014 in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.\n\nMoreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.\n\nIn any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.\n\nPrice to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company\u2019s sales/revenues \u2014 a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.\n\nPrice to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share \u2014 a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.\n\nPEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.\n\nCurrent Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\n\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\n\nValue Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.\n\nHere are five of the 10 picks that qualified the screening:\n\nHeadquartered in Detroit,\u00a0General Motors is one of the world\u2019s largest automakers.

        "content": "General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 14th of March to $0.12. Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 1.2% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns.\n\nView our latest analysis for General Motors\n\nGeneral Motors' Payment Has Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. However, General Motors' earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.\n\nOver the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 22.4%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 3.3% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range. historic-dividend\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $1.20 total annually to $0.48. The dividend has shrunk at around 8.8% a year during that period. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.\n\nWe Could See General Motors' Dividend Growing\n\nGiven that dividend payments have been shrinking like a glacier in a warming world, we need to check if there are some bright spots on the horizon. General Motors has impressed us by growing EPS at 8.9% per year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for General Motors' prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.\n\nGeneral Motors Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock\n\nIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.\n\nIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Some of these brands include Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE:HMC), Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), Mercedes-Benz, and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), to name a few. Standing the test of time, these brands have been more reliable than the newer technologies coming in these days. According to Consumer Reports' 2023 Auto Reliability Survey, new electric vehicles have 79% more problems than Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. Plug-in hybrids have been even worse, according to the survey. These plug-in hybrids have been reported to have 146% more problems than ICE vehicles.\n\nThe CR report further notes that amongst all automobiles, the most reliable types are sedans, wagons, and hatchbacks, further revealing that Toyota, Lexus, and Mini are three of the most reliable car brands as of the year 2023. Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE:HMC)\u2019s luxury car brand, Acura, came in at fourth position, while mainstream Honda bagged the fifth. As such, the report concludes that Asian automobile brands lead reliability by a wide margin with an overall average reliability score of 63. With that said it must be noted that the global population is aging drastically. As of 2023, 21% of the population in developed countries has already surpassed the 65-year-old mark, which means these people are the largest consumers of the automobile industry. To target these senior buyers, car brands have already begun reinventing themselves by focusing on convenience and safety.\n\nStory continues\n\nA notable example is Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)'s architecture working with CAD models to simulate and analyze how individuals behave when they are entering and exiting vehicles. Taking into account factors such as the optimal height-to-ground distance and step-over width, Ford aims to make improvements that cater to the needs of older drivers. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is actively exploring avenues to enhance driving security for older individuals as well, considering innovations like facial recognition technology to initiate the engine start. On the other hand, Audi has taken a proactive stance by implementing advanced assist features.\n\nThese automobile brands acknowledge the changes that accompany aging and their potential impact on driving capabilities. The gradual slowdown of reaction times is one such effect of aging. Therefore, an ideal car for seniors must incorporate essential features like power steering, power brakes, and assisted driving technologies. Notably, automobile brands are taking care of these aspects for a smoother driving experience. However, beyond the convenience features, we circle back to the factor that takes center stage: reliability. Given the potential for increased wear and tear due to age-related changes in driving abilities, a dependable vehicle becomes paramount for seniors. Since retirees are dependent on fixed incomes, used cars yet reliable may be the best foot forward for them, which is why we have crafted a list of the same. 14 Best Used Cars for Retirees to Buy in 2024\n\nA row of used cars with shoppers inspecting them on a lot.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile the list of best-used cars for retirees to buy in 2024, we have used several sources such as the Kelly Blue Book, Nasdaq, Northumbria Cars, Finance Buzz, as well as car forums. Next, we adopted a consensus approach to picking the best-used cars for the elderly. Each time a source mentioned a car, it was awarded one point. Scores were summed and places were ranked in ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores. \u00a0Car prices have been sourced from Edmunds, Car Gurus, and TrueCar.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are the best-used cars for retirees to buy in 2024:\n\n14. 2012-16 Buick LaCrosse\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 4\n\nPrice: $6,825 to $18,998\n\nOne of the best used cars under $20,000, the 2012-2016 Buick LaCrosse lineup comes equipped with features that enhance comfort, safety, and the overall driving experience for seniors.

        "title": "Consumer Reports: BMW named top pick in overall brand rankings; Subaru top mainstream brand",
        "content": "Make it two years in a row for Bimmer.\n\nConsumer Reports (CR) named BMW (BMWYY) the top overall pick in its 2024 Brand Report Card rankings, with the German automaker becoming the first back-to-back winner since 2017. It cements BMW as one of the few luxury brands owners can count on for overall satisfaction \u2014 something unusual in CR\u2019s rankings.\n\nCR\u2019s coveted brand rankings list is based on the average overall score that combines road-test scores, predicted reliability, owner satisfaction data, and safety criteria for all of the tested models from each automaker. BMW X5 xDrive50e Plug-In Hybrid SUV on display at a dealership on Sept.15, 2023. (Getty Images) (jetcityimage via Getty Images)\n\n\u201c[BMW is] making cars that are reliable, and the cars perform extremely well in testing, and they're filled with safety equipment,\u201d Jake Fisher, CR\u2019s director of auto testing, said to Yahoo Finance. \u201cThis is a brand that, of the 12 models that we've tested, 12 of them we could recommend.\u201d\n\nSubaru (FUJHY) took the No. 2 spot, remaining the top mainstream brand. \u201cWhat's more interesting, probably at the top, is seeing Subaru; they\u2019re No. 2 sandwiched between two luxurious expensive German automakers [BMW and Porsche, at No. 3], and that's almost more impressive that this is a brand with much more affordable vehicles that also score well,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nFor the top five, BMW had an overall score of 82 out of 100, Subaru came in at 80, as did Porsche (POAHY), while Honda (HMC) came in at 78, followed by Lexus (TM) with 78.\n\nFisher noted some big moves for Cadillac (68) and Ford (65), which are squarely in the middle of the pack. \u201cCadillac went up 11 spots; this just attests to Cadillac improving in terms of reliability. And Cadillac and Ford [are] both really kind of on the leading edge in terms of automated driving systems,\u201d Fisher said, alluding to GM\u2019s (GM) SuperCruise and Ford\u2019s (F) Blue Cruise technology.\n\nTesla (TSLA), which was once at the bottom of the overall score card has been climbing as well, and now entered the middle pack at 62.\n\n\u201cTesla has been steadily improving in terms of reliability,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cThey've been around long enough that they're working out just kind of the build issues on the vehicles, probably more so than some of the brand newcomers like, like a Lucid, or Rivian, but they've been around long enough that they have a lot of experience making electric powertrains, more so than some of the legacy automakers.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking of Rivian (RIVN), it was among the bottom five scorers in the CR brand report card, scoring 55. That ignominious list also starred Jeep (STLA) (46), GMC (53), Jaguar (52), and Land Rover (50).\n\nHybrids abound in CR's top cars A Ford Maverick FWD Hybrid on display at a dealership. (Getty Images) (jetcityimage via Getty Images)\n\nPart and parcel to CR\u2019s Brand Report Card is its annual top 10 cars list, which is broken down across categories such as best compact car, small pickup, and midsize SUV.\n\nWhat\u2019s notable across the top 10 vehicle winners is that six of them are hybrids or plug-in hybrids, one of them is a pure EV, and only three are traditional gas-powered cars.\n\nThe electrified models that made CR\u2019s annual best-of-the-best list include the Toyota Camry Hybrid, Toyota Prius/Prius Prime, Ford Maverick Hybrid, Toyota Highlander Hybrid, Toyota RAV4 Prime, Tesla Model Y, and BMW X5 PHEV. Only three in the list are repeat winners: the Forester, Maverick Hybrid, and Highlander Hybrid.\n\n\u201cFor many drivers, PHEVs [plug-in hybrid electric vehicles] will save you money over the long run when compared with a gas, hybrid, or electric vehicle,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cIn most cases, the more you plug in a PHEV, the more money you\u2019ll save.\u201d\n\nFisher added that the hybrids of the past are much different than today's hybrids, which perform better, get better fuel economy, and are more pleasant to operate \u2014 no more whining coming from prior-generation CVT transmissions, for instance. Overall, the driving experience for hybrids and plug-in hybrids has surpassed traditional gas-powered cars, Fisher said.\n\nCR noted that hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and EVs have never been more popular, accounting for 16.3% of consumer vehicle purchases in the US last year, per Ward\u2019s Intelligence, with PHEV sales surging 60% last year, according to CR\u2019s data research.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "2 Top-Ranked Domestic Auto Stocks to Drive Portfolio Gains",
        "content": "The outlook for the Zacks Domestic Auto\u00a0industry is optimistic, fueled by sustained vehicle demand and improved inventory levels, facilitating generous discounts to boost sales. While sales growth may slow down this year compared to 2023, the overall trajectory remains positive, benefiting industry giants. Additionally, the cost of vehicle financing is projected to decrease. Despite the slower-than-expected adoption of electric vehicles, sales are anticipated to surpass 2023 levels. Overall, industry sentiment is upbeat, with top-ranked stocks such as General Motors GM and PACCAR PCAR positioned as attractive options to capitalize on the industry's strengths.\n\nIndustry Overview\n\nThe Zacks\u00a0Domestic Auto\u00a0industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry \u2014 which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people \u2014 is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through. The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in the fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development, and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.\n\nKey Investing Themes\n\nSales to Continue Upward Trajectory Albeit at a Slower Pace: New vehicle sales in the United States reached their highest levels in 2023 since 2019 thanks to\u00a0pent-up demand, improved inventories, attractive incentives and a rise in fleet sales.\u00a0While sales are expected to rise in 2024 as well, the growth rate is expected to decelerate, as much of the pent-up demand was largely absorbed in 2023. With the Fed expected to cut rates thrice this year, the cost of vehicle financing is likely to decline, which might help in fueling sales volumes.\n\nStory continues\n\nEasing Supply Chain Issues: Supply chain snarls, an aftermath of COVID-19, have been considerably alleviated. New vehicle inventory has sharply rebounded. Per J.D. Power and GlobalData estimates, inventory levels were at about 1.6 million vehicles at the end of last month, a 3.3% increase from December and a 38% jump from January 2023. Cox Automotive expects new vehicle inventory to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2024, reaching almost 3 million units, tripling the quantity during the chip shortage. Ample inventory will result in enhanced incentives and discounts for consumers, helping to stabilize vehicle prices and reduce affordability concerns.\n\nE-Mobility Growth Amid Challenges: The outlook for the EV industry remains promising but nuanced. While demand for EVs is on the rise, achieving higher sales will require concerted efforts from dealers and manufacturers. Despite initial optimism, the shift from lofty expectations to realistic projections reflects the slower-than-anticipated pace of customer acceptance. Consequently, some major automakers are revising their ambitious EV plans. However, the industry is poised for expansion in 2024, with an increasing variety of EV models, higher incentives, discounts, advertising and sales initiatives. Cox Automotive forecasts EV sales in the United States to surpass the 1 million unit milestone achieved in 2023. This signals a continued momentum toward electrification, albeit with an understanding that overcoming consumer hesitancy remains a key challenge.\n\nEncouraging Zacks Industry Rank\n\nThe Zacks Automotive \u2013 Domestic industry is part of the broader Zacks\u00a0Auto-Tires-Trucks\u00a0sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #103, which places it in the top 41% of 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group\u2019s\u00a0Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry\u2019s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group\u2019s earnings growth potential.\n\nBefore we present you two top-ranked stocks from the industry, let's take a look at the industry\u2019s stock market performance and current valuation.\n\nIndustry Lags Sector and S&P 500\n\nThe Domestic Auto industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite and the sector over the past year. The industry has lost 16.4% against the S&P 500\u2019s rally of 28.7%. The sector has inched up 0.5% over the said time frame.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 15.42X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 14.28X and the sector\u2019s 13.66X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 60.03X, as low as 9.32X and at a median of 22.72X, as the chart below shows.\n\nEV/EBITDA Ratio (Past Five Years)\n\n2 Best Buys\n\nGeneral Motors: One of the world\u2019s largest automakers, General Motors held the largestshare of the U.S. auto market at 16.2% in 2023. General Motors\u2019 compelling portfolio with strong demand for its quality full-size pickups and SUVs bodes well. The company\u2019s hot-selling brands in America, like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra, are driving the top line.\n\nThe automaker plans to roll out 30 fresh EV models by 2025-end. Solid demand for GMC Hummer EV, Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV, Cadillac Lyric, Equinox EV, Silverdo EV, Sierra EV, Blazer EV and BrightDrop Zevo 600 is expected to boost sales.\u00a0The company's Ultium platform and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are set to scale up its e-mobility prowess. Its superior liquidity profile and cost-containment efforts also instill confidence. General Motors\u2019 strides in autonomous vehicle development also augur well for long-term growth.\n\nGM currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A.\u00a0The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors\u2019 2024 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 1.8% and 17.2%, respectively. The consensus mark for GM\u2019s 2024 and 2025 EPS has moved north by $1.27 and $1.70, respectively, over the past 30 days. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on all occasions, the average surprise being 19.9%.\n\nPrice & Consensus: GM\n\nPACCAR: Headquartered in Bellevue, PACCAR is one of the leading names in the trucking business with reputed brands like Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF.\u00a0The company achieved record revenues and net income in 2023. It expects solid order intake in North America this year.\u00a0Continued growth in aftermarket parts \u2014 which is a high margin and a less cyclic business, thanks to the rampant adoption of its proprietary MX engine \u2014 bodes well.\n\nAccelerated efforts toward electrification, connected vehicle services and advanced driver-assistance system options are\u00a0set to bolster PACCAR\u2019s prospects.\u00a0A solid balance sheet with low leverage is another tailwind.\u00a0PACCAR\u2019s strong balance sheet is complemented by A+ and A1 credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively.\n\nPACCAR currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of B.\u00a0 The consensus mark for PCAR\u2019s 2024 and 2025 EPS has moved north by 19 cents and 6 cents, respectively, over the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PACCAR\u2019s 2025 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 8.2% and 10.3%, respectively. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on all occasions, the average surprise being 17.1%.\n\nPrice & Consensus: PCAR\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "BYD Is Going After The Luxury Market As It Sets Its Eyes On Expanding To Europe",
        "content": "Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) enjoyed the non-existent EV competitive landscape for quite a while as legacy automakers such as General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F) struggled to evolve. But then, China\u2019s leading EV maker, came to the scene and turned Tesla\u2019s world upside down. When it showed its new model back in 2007, BYD Company Limited (OTC: BYDDY) was a laughingstock. But, no one is laughing at BYD now who went far from being a battery manufacturer with a poor attempt of making a car to Tesla\u2019s biggest threat. During the weekend, BYD even unveiled a super EV that promises to challenge even the luxurious Ferrari on the speed front.\n\nBYD Is Going After The Luxury Market\n\nA large part of BYD\u2019s cars is in the lower price range, but BYD is also going for its part of the luxury market.\u00a0Last year, BYD introduced its luxury brand\u00a0Yangwang. Its super EV, the U9, will come from its luxury line.\u00a0With a top speed of 309.19 kph, or 192.12 mph\u00a0and the ability\u00a0to accelerate to 100 kph within\u00a0only\u00a02.36 seconds, BYD\u2019s newest EV is in line with long-established automakers such as Ferrari. However, Chinese EV makers have a significant advantage over their global rivals, the fact that China is the key market for\u00a0a lithium iron phosphate\u00a0production. These batteries are cheaper because they do not require expensive metals like cobalt.\n\nBYD\u2019s growth is unlike anything the automotive industry has seen in decades.\n\nLast year, BYD made more than\u00a03 million new-energy vehicles, made of 1.6 million battery-only cars and 1.4 million hybrids.\u00a0But, BYD is now going for its piece of the luxury market while also expanding its global footprint beyond China. BYD does not sells its EVs and hybrids in the U.S. due to Trump era tariffs, which bodes well for Tesla, but it does sell buses. Even Tesla CEO admitted in January that if there were no trade barriers, the Chinese companies would pretty much demolish their rivals with their exported vehicles. However, Europe is another story. Last year, BYD announced it will build its first factory in Europe and the latest news suggest it will be in Hungary. Hungarian Prime Minister met with BYD\u2019s leaders during the weekend to discuss this multi-billion investment that would be the greatest in the country\u2019s history.\u00a0\u00a0Through subsidies, Beijing is strongly supporting Chinese companies to expand internationally in response to foreign trade restrictions.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, legacy automaker General Motors is also re-entering Europe after its 2017 exit. GM chose to leave Europe after nine decades to focus on North America and China. Moreover, General Motors chose luxury EVs for its comeback, going after France and Sweden first as it plans to expand to five European markets. General Motors just announced that\u00a0direct-to-consumer sales of the Cadillac Lyriq will\u00a0kick off in France\u00a0as of March 23rd.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Pick These 4 Low P/CF Stocks to Spruce Up Your Portfolio",
        "content": "Value investing is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. It is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.\r\n\r\nThere are different valuation metrics to determine a stock\u2019s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company\u2019s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. General Motors Company GM, Adtalem Global Education Inc. ATGE, Unum Group UNM and KB Home KBH boast a low P/CF ratio.\r\n\r\nThis metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis \u2013 the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.\r\n\r\nAnalysts caution that a company\u2019s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.\r\n\r\nPositive cash flow indicates an increase in a company\u2019s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company\u2019s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.\r\n\r\nHowever, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.\r\n\r\nThe Bargain Hunting Strategy\r\n\r\nHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:\r\n\r\nP/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.\r\n\r\nPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\r\n\r\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\r\n\r\nP/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.\r\n\r\nP/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.\r\n\r\nP/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company\u2019s sales \u2014 the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.\r\n\r\nPEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\r\n\r\nValue Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.\r\n\r\nHere are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:\r\n\r\nGeneral Motors, which designs, builds, and sells cars, trucks, crossovers, and automobile parts globally, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

        "title": "GM returns to France with fully-electric Cadillac Lyriq",
        "content": "By Gilles Guillaume\n\nPARIS, Feb 26 (Reuters) - U.S. automaker General Motors on Monday unveiled its luxury electric Cadillac Lyriq in France, an expansion of its market in Europe after returning last year and a test of whether online-only sales will attract wealthy car buyers.\n\nIn October GM announced it was launching sales in Switzerland, the first step in an all-electric return to European markets since selling off the Opel and Vauxhall brands in 2017.\n\nUnlike in its home market where it relies on a large dealer network, European customers can customise and purchase their Cadillac EVs entirely online.\n\nEurope's automakers are focused on trying to build more affordable EVs, under pressure from Chinese competitors and slowing demand growth. GM's European head Jaclyn McQuaid told reporters at a launch event in Paris that electric SUVs are expected to remain the fastest-growing segment for zero-emission vehicles.\n\n\"When you look at the battery electric vehicle market in France, it is the luxury market that grew to the greatest extent,\" McQuaid said. \"The luxury market is where the focus is right now.\"\n\nThe best-selling electric car in France last year was Tesla's Model Y SUV, which starts at 42,990 euros ($46,500) in that market.\n\nHighlighting Cadillac's French heritage - the French adventurer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac founded Detroit in 1701 - McQuaid said other electric models would follow using the same architecture as the Lyriq, which is made in Tennessee.\n\nIn Switzerland the Lyriq has a starting price of 82,000 Swiss francs ($93,100), but GM did not provide pricing for France.\n\nCadillac also plans a showroom in Paris and the Lyriq can be ordered online from March 23. The luxury EV is due to launch in other European markets, starting with Germany by year-end.\n\n($1 = 0.9244 euros, 0.8811 Swiss francs) (Reporting by Gilles Guillaume; Writing by Nick Carey; Editing by Ros Russell)",

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 20 most valuable electric car companies in the world. This article will focus on recent industry trends and the major players in the industry. If you want to skip our analysis, you can proceed to the section highlighting the 5 Most Valuable Electric Car Companies in the World.\n\nThe electric vehicle revolution has disrupted the automotive industry over the past decade. There has been an exponential surge in sales. This growth results from numerous factors, including rising government funding and the spread of charging infrastructure. Key technologies contributing to the growth of the EV market include battery technology, electric motors, and autonomous vehicles. Electric vehicles attract the car community with their remarkable performance, power, and torque. The EV market offers investment opportunities to investors looking for high-growth areas. You can also take a look at our article12 Best EV Stocks To Buy For 2024.\n\nAn Analysis of the EV Industry\n\nAccording to a report by Markets and Markets, the global electric vehicle market was worth $388.1 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $951.9 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.7%. The Asia Pacific region, Middle East, and Africa are expected to drive significant growth in the global electric vehicle market. Moreover, China is expected to remain the world\u2019s largest market for EVs.\n\nManufacturers are introducing EV variations of their most popular car models. On February 7, 2024, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) revealed its all-electric Puma Gen-E in the UK, with a starting price of $32,500. BMW (OTC:BMWYY) launched its electric vehicle, the i5, worldwide on February 12, 2024. In the United States, it debuted with a starting price of $66,800. The top-tier model, the i5 Touring, boasts a range of up to 348 miles. Tesla, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model Y became the world\u2019s best-selling vehicle, with 1.2 million units sold in 2023, due to its low sticker price of $45,000. On 24 January 2024, Reuters reportedthat a new generation Tesla will be launched by the second half of 2025. with a starting price of only $25,000. Due to its affordable price, the new generation Tesla will compete fiercely with cheaper gas-powered cars.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q4 2023, Tesla, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) revenue only grew 3%, and its gross profit dropped by 23% year over year. That's primarily due to the price cuts on the vehicles it sells. The mass production of its new Cybertruck model also came with costs, driving gross margins down. High interest rates have also affected the sales of all automobile manufacturers. Tesla, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja talked about CyberTruck's impact on gross margins in the company's Q4 2023 earnings call:\n\nIn our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despite us being in the early phase of Cybertruck era. As a result, our auto gross margin improved sequentially. That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control, like the change in tariffs or local incentives, to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.\n\nDevelopments in EV Battery Technology\n\nContinental Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) (SHE:300750) has remained the world\u2019s largest manufacturer and supplier of lithium-ion batteries used in electric cars, buses and trucks. According to a reportby SNE Research, Continental Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) (SHE:300750) produced 37% of the world\u2019s EV batteries in 2023, followed by BYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDF) at 16%. While lithium-ion batteries currently dominate the market, companies are actively exploring new minerals to lower costs, increase range, and charge faster. Sodium-ion batteries are a safer and lower-cost option than lithium-ion batteries.\n\nBYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDF), with local conglomerate Huaihai Holding Group, is building a sodium-ion battery plant in Jiangsu, China, with an investment of $1.4 billion. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on January 4, 2024. The plant is expected to have an annual output capacity of 30 GWh.\n\nStellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) is one of the most valuable car manufacturers in the world and is also in on the sodium-ion batteries scene. On January 12, Stellantis Ventures, the corporate venture fund of Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) announced that it is investing in Tiamat Energy, a French company that is developing sodium-ion battery technology that offers better performance in colder weather, extended range, and quicker charge times.\n\nNot only is Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA)\u00a0making investments in battery technology, but the group is also set to launch its electric vehicle offerings in the US in 2024. On February 15, CNN reported that the company will roll out its first electric vehicles in the US market this year. Currently, Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) offers its electric vehicles in Europe, however it is working on bridging the gap between the profit margins of its electric vehicles and traditional ICE-powered offerings. Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares said:\n\n\"We are working very, very hard to bring the profit margins of electrified vehicles to the same level as ICEs. We are not there yet. But we are getting closer.\"\n\nReaching net zero also means decarbonizing EV charging stations. PairedPower, an innovative manufacturer of solar-powered electric vehicle chargers, has introduced a solar-powered parking canopy designed for electric vehicles, among other off-grid EV charging solutions.\n\nAdvancements in battery technology and electric vehicles are expected to drive the growth of the global electric vehicle industry. Investors stand to gain by learning about the biggest electric vehicle companies in the world. With that said, here is the list of the 20 most valuable electric car companies in the world. 20 Most Valuable Electric Car Companies in the World\n\n20 Most Valuable Electric Car Companies in the World\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most valuable electric vehicle companies in the world, we went over several sources, including industry reports, our own rankings, and multiple similar rankings. We also scanned the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners. For public companies, we checked each company's market capitalization, as of February 20, 2024, on Yahoo Finance. The market caps for foreign companies were converted to US dollars based on the exchange rates of the respective country. To quantify the \"value\" or \"size\" of private companies, we selected either the estimated valuation, or the annual revenue available for the most recent fiscal year, or the number of employees, subject to availability of data. The estimated valuation was sourced from major media reports based on the private companies' latest funding round. The annual revenue or number of employees were sourced from official statements by the company and the company's website. Since no private company made it to our list, we have ranked the most valuable electric vehicle companies in the world in ascending order of their market capitalization, as of February 20, 2024.\n\nNote: While we prioritized ranking pure-play electric car companies, we also considered traditional automakers with larger electric vehicle divisions than many new and emerging pure-play EV companies.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "content": "Carvana (CVNA) posted its first ever annual profit and issued a strong first-quarter forecast. Shares of the company are moving higher on Friday in response to the report. \r\n\r\nYahoo Finance Reporter Pras Subramanian joins the Live show to discuss the report and give key insights into what investors should know when considering Carvana for their portfolios.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: I will. Carvana shares are surging this morning on the company's latest report here that we are seeing. You're looking at a jump of just about 36%. Clearly, there is a lot of optimism playing out on the street price. Given the fact that Carvana is much better positioned or at least the belief right now than it was compared to a year ago.\n\nYou have revenue though, on the other hand, did miss the Street's expectations. What is this report really tell us about the positioning and the future of the company?\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I thought to myself, Carvana really pulled a rabbit out of the hat here. I mean, this company was-- I hate to say it was almost left for dead for a while. In fact, some of its competitors like vroom did not survive and I guess they were able to they beat on Q4 earnings the adjusted EBITDA. They were able to improve their profit per car almost like double compared to last year.\n\nSo they're cutting costs there, they're able to refinance a lot of debt and push that out and they say that they'll have a better quarter even Q1 is looking good for them too. And the market is normalizing. Used car prices are coming down, they're able to buy more cheaper cheaply and then turn them around and sell them to consumers.\n\nBut I think Wall Street also is still a bit more fearful about the debt load that they have, it's a huge debt load and it's like how much can you keep refinancing, diluting your stock and keep pushing that out. I think that's the question now but today the stock is up a lot.\n\nStory continues\n\nBRAD SMITH: Should investors be concerned at all though when you've got and you hear about companies like Hertz, some of the car rental companies that are saying, hey, we're going to get rid of some of our fleet and that is now used cars that are entering into the market. So that supply being added in as another option for consumers to consider.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I mean, your overall supply coming going up so prices may come down. But I would argue Carvana probably buys a lot of these cars from Hertz. That's a big channel for them to bring in new cars to sell to their customers. So it's a give and take there. It's a dynamic changing market. There's still a demand for cheap cars, people still need cars to get around. And I think that Carvana is now able to capitalize on that market trend.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Well, if anybody is looking for anything else to get around. I've got some top tips here in New York at least. It's a trek. Pras, thanks so much for taking the time here on the day",

        "title": "EVs Need The Power Of A.I And Customized Semiconductors To Reach The Finish Line",
        "content": "It\u2019s a well-known fact that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is much more than an EV company. Moreover, it could even challenge the AI chip leader someday in the future. Despite its mind-blowing results, even the leadership of Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) is threatened by the fact its clients such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) are running to make AI semiconductors in-house. The EV king, Tesla Inc is also among those who flexed its innovative muscle to make its customized A.I. chips in-house. Last year, Elon Musk stated that Tesla plans to spend $2 billion to build its A.I. supercomputer. Moreover, Morgan Stanley stated in September that with its new supercomputing power, Tesla could position itself as a strong rival even to Nvidia.\n\nEven the automotive accessory creator Worksport tapped into the semiconductor expertise.\n\nEarlier in February, Worksport revealed its partnership with Infineon Technologies (OTC: IFFNNF), a global designer and manufacturer of semiconductors and semiconductor-based solutions specialized in automotive and industrial end markets. Through this collaboration, Worksport aims to reduce the cost and weight of its portable power stations. By using Infineon\u2019s GAN power semiconductors, Worksport will be able to boost the efficiency while lowering the weight, size and cost of its power converters used in its COR portable battery system. More precisely, Infineon\u2019s technology will empower Worksport to lower the\u00a0weight of its battery system by 33%\u00a0and reduce system costs by up to 25%.\n\nWhile finalizing the COR battery system, Worksport is also preparing its power pal, the SOLIS solar-powered tonneau cover.\u00a0The power-on-go duo promises to enhance the range of electric pickup and provide off-grid power. Today, Worksport also revealed its\u00a0new distribution partner, Canada\u2019s leading wholesaler of aftermarket truck products, Dix Performance North. Dix Performance North covers all major car and truck brands, including automotive giants like Ford Motor (NYSE: F), General Motors (NYSE: GM), Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM), Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF), and Stellantis N.V. (NYSE: STLA), and from now on, it will also include Worksport\u2019s covers. Earlier this week, Worksport also revealed a version of its SOLIS solar cover will be available for the Ford F-150 Lightning. Although the electric version of its iconic pickup didn\u2019t succeed to awaken the luster of its internal-combustion-engine counterpart, Worksport\u2019s solar-powered tonneau cover could help Ford\u00a0boost its appeal. Ford has been struggling on the EV front and scaling back its EV ambitions, but it has no doubt that EVs are here to stay so it definitely needs all the help it can get.\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough Infineon that is banking in the AI boom, Worksport gained access to powerful breakthroughs on this revolutionary front.\n\nInfineon Technologies is heavily betting on the AI boom to boost their chip sales. Infineon CEO\u00a0Jochen Hanebeck stated today that the company is positioned to\u00a0generate billions in revenue and grow by selling higher price chips. For the 2024 fiscal year, Infineon expects to generate revenues in the low three-digit million euros range, while guiding for annual revenues of around one billion euros in a matter of few years. However, although Infineon posted record results for the 2022/2023 fiscal year, it also scaled back its targets for 2023/2024 due to a weakening macroeconomic outlook. But, despite its lowered guidance, the potential for lucrative semiconductor sales is undoubtedly there as both tech and EV companies need them.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "16 Best Fuel-Efficient Cars for Retirees To Buy in 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 16 Best Fuel-Efficient Cars for Retirees To Buy in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of the global automobile industry, then you can take a look at our top picks of 5 Best Fuel-Efficient Cars for Retirees To Buy in 2024.\n\nThe automobile industry is one of the biggest and most important industries in the global market. This report by AZO Materials estimates the automobile industry to be valued at around USD2,810 billion. This market is predicted to grow bigger at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 3.71% and reach a net value of USD 3,970 billion by the year 2030.\n\nCurrently, the Japanese car manufacturer,\u00a0 Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) is leading the global automobile market sales for the fourth year in a row. A report by Fortune highlights Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) to have sold 11.2 million units in 2023. The closest competitor to Toyota is Volkswagen, which sold 9.24 million units. The same report notes that Toyota Motor Corporation\u2019s (NYSE: TM) dominance this year may be attributed to its sales in Hybrid cars. The Japanese car manufacturer saw a 34.1% rise in hybrid sales in 2023.\n\nAs we are noticing here, sales in car manufacturing are rapidly rising in the fuel-efficient hybrid car segment. The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) has accelerated due to significant investments made by numerous major automakers in EV infrastructure and technology. To address rising consumer demand and regulatory pressure to reduce emissions, companies like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), and established manufacturers like Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Volkswagen have been expanding their electric car offerings.\n\nFuel-efficient cars are in. The reason behind this is likely to be price-hedging by customers against oil. Consumers may be anticipating a rise in oil prices in the future and hence would rather make a one-time investment in fuel-efficient cars to prevent higher costs down the line. This report by Reuters highlights that December 2023 saw a 1.9% rise in Brent Crude Oil prices, the highest it has been since November 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur staff notes that the transition to EVs may require more infrastructural developments such as increased availability of maintenance crews and charging stations. While this is true, the shift towards at least hybrid cars is occurring amongst consumers. This may be because consumers, especially those looking for low maintenance and high fuel-efficiency cars appreciate the reliability of hybrid cars. However, in cases where a certain hybrid car may have a weak reputation in reliability (due to problems of breakdown being reportedly common), some ease-conscious consumers are likely to buy less fuel-efficient cars with high reliability.\n\nFurther market segmentation is important to divide a diverse group of cars into targetable segments. The report by focus2move segments cars based on different models, using factors such as age, geography, and comfort. Married customers are more likely to look for cars that have a spacious interior and reliable safety options, along with reliability and long-term value. Similarly, retirees looking to spend a moderate amount can look for budget-friendly options with low costs of maintenance. One of the best cars based on these needs, the KIA Carens, sold 260,227 units in 2023, reporting a 1.7% increase from last year.\n\nRetirement is the start of a new phase in life, a period for leisure, exploration, and savoring the rewards of hard work. The number of retirees seems to be increasing, seeing how the value of retired workers receiving Social Security benefits went up from 34.59 million in 2010 to 48.59 million in 2022, according to this report by RetireGuide. An article by Autoflex Leasing already shows how retirees should choose fuel-efficient cars as their reliable travel companions, even though large SUVs and flashy sports cars may have their appeal. The appeal of EVs and hybrid cars is greater, given their lower maintenance costs. On the contrary, a standard combustion engine has an average maintenance cost of $0.09 for every mile traveled according to this report by Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F). Cars that use less fuel can save a lot of money at the gas pump, extending retirement savings.\n\nLet's now head over to the list of the best fuel-efficient cars for retirees to buy in 2024. 16 Best Fuel Efficient Cars for Retirees To Buy in 2024\n\nA fleet of cars is parked at a car rental company's headquarters, symbolizing the company's commitment to servicing its customers.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nGiven the wide variety of available cars, retired people need to know what exactly they should be looking for when they go to a car dealership. Key considerations for seniors and retired officials include the fit of the car, ease of access, reliability, and overall comfort. When contemplating a new car purchase, retirees should weigh all the variables that can be affected by devoting retirement savings to this endeavor. Fasten your seat belts! To help you make an informed decision that best meets your needs and financial objectives, here are some methods to evaluate this decision: first, consider the effects of taking money out of your retirement funds; second, research other financing choices.\n\nOur article divides cars based on three main factors. These factors take into consideration both the aspect of fuel efficiency and the fact that the car is going to be owned by a retired person. For our list, we have surveyed the highest quality sources we could find and then reported scores out of a total of 15, across the 3 metrics of fuel efficiency, seating capacity, and reliability. These sources include Car and Driver, Capital One Auto Navigator, Reliability Index, and Medium articles. We give them equal weightage in terms of deciding what car to buy. The breakdown of the scoring used in our rankings is as follows:\n\n1) Fuel efficiency: miles per gallon as a standard for fuel consumption \u2013 scale (5 stars)\n\n2) Seating capacity: Number of passengers that the car can fit \u2013 scale (5 stars)\n\n3) Reliability: problems in equipment and maintenance - scale (5 stars)\n\nThe ratings of these different variables will be added to provide a total score of 15. The higher the score, the better the car is for retirees looking for a fuel-efficient car.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Look Bullish on General Motors Company (GM): Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about General Motors Company (GM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nGeneral Motors Company currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.83, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 21 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.83 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 21 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 9.5% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GM Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for GM\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for General Motors Company here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying General Motors Company, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs GM Worth Investing In?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for General Motors Company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 16.4% over the past month to $9.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for General Motors Company. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for General Motors Company may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Rivian, Lucid tumble as analysts grow wary of 'lackluster' growth, new product timelines",
        "content": "Shares of Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID) hit new all-time lows on Thursday after reporting quarterly results that disappointed the Street and raised concerns that the pure-play EV makers are not evolving quickly enough, particularly with EV demand waning.\n\nRivian said it sees vehicle production for 2024 hitting 57,000 units, well below the 80,000 units expected. In terms of full-year profitability, Rivian said it sees an adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.70 billion vs. $2.59 billion expected, and the company said it would cut 10% of salaried staff, citing economic uncertainty.\n\n\"Perhaps more worrisome [than Q4 results], the company\u2019s 2024 guidance appears aggressive, as it assumes an improvement in order rate, and seemingly incorporates no price cuts; Rivian also reiterated its goal of reaching positive gross margin in 4Q23 which seems optimistic amid demand concerns,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner wrote in a note to clients on Thursday morning. Rivian electric trucks are seen parked near the Nasdaq MarketSite building in Times Square on Nov. 10, 2021, in New York City. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\nLucid reported a revenue miss, though a narrower-than-expected adjusted EBITDA loss, but its production outlook of 9,000 vehicles for 2024 disappointed Wall Street. Stifel analyst Stephen Gengaro called the production guidance \u201clackluster\u201d in a note to clients this morning.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe in LCID\u2019s technology, but see 2024 as a difficult year with high interest rates and a high price point for LCID\u2019s vehicles,\u201d Baird analyst Ben Kallo wrote.\n\nKallo\u2019s commentary could be applied to Rivian as well. Pure-play EV makers\u2019 profitability plans are paramount to the investor thesis for the companies. Rivian, Lucid, and Fisker (FSR) have seen their shares hammered over the past year as a string of loss-producing quarters and a tough EV demand environment have left investors with little patience for underperformance.\n\nOn the flip side, legacy automakers like Ford, GM, Stellantis, and Volkswagen can pivot back to gas and hybrid engine offerings, while minimizing commitments to their EV game plans, and still be profitable.\n\nStory continues\n\nBarclays analyst Dan Levy was positive on Ford\u2019s change in EV spending. \u201cWhile the EV transition remains central for Ford, commentary on the call indicated some pivot on EV strategy for Ford \u2014 reflecting the broader market challenges in EV demand. Overall, Ford is pushing to be more mindful of capital requirements and vehicle economics,\u201d Levy wrote.\n\nFord rival Stellantis\u2019s CEO Carlos Tavares said at a media roundtable this week that the automaker can plan its EV spending in stages. For instance, it can wait until 2027 to set up spending for its 2032 plans, instead of having to spend billions right now without any insight.\n\nPure-play EV makers don\u2019t have that luxury. They have to spend money now and hope for the eventual EV transformation to happen.\n\nNew products coming ... but not fast enough Workers marry the body structure with the battery pack and the front and rear sub frames as they assemble electric vehicles at the Lucid Motors plant in Casa Grande, Ariz., Sept. 28, 2021. (Caitlin O'Hara/REUTERS/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nLucid\u2019s latest round of EV price cuts last week will likely hurt the company\u2019s margin going forward, and the company said on its conference call that tooling for its new Gravity SUV will impact those margins as well.\n\nLucid said it produced only 2,391 vehicles in the fourth quarter and delivered 1,734. With the company claiming scale will help bring down the costs, investors are questioning how much of a scale effect exists for a vehicle that starts around $69,000, going all the way up to $250,000 for the Lucid Air Sapphire.\n\nPart of the big growth story for Rivan and Lucid will be their upcoming, less costly EV offerings, which both companies say will be cheaper to make. Rivian is set to debut its R2 vehicle on March 7, with Lucid also claiming it has a \u201chigh-volume midsize platform\u201d in the works. The issue for both Rivian and Lucid is both of these vehicles are coming out mid-decade \u2014 early 2026 for Rivian and late 2026 for Lucid.\n\nAnalysts on both Rivian's and Lucid\u2019s quarterly conference calls asked each company what they could do to pull forward those production start dates to no avail.\n\nIt seems investors and analysts may be more concerned about how crucial \u201ctime to market\u201d is for these cheaper EVs in an evolving EV landscape than the companies are able to achieve themselves.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "12 SUVs With the Highest Resale Value in 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will look at the 12 SUVs With the Highest Resale Value in 2024. If you want to skip the analysis of the SUV market, you can go directly to 5 SUVs With the Highest Resale Value in 2024.\n\nIn 2024, the SUV market is undergoing significant changes influenced by various factors shaping consumer preferences and market dynamics. The SUV market was valued at USD 907.94 billion in 2023 and is anticipated to reach USD 1079.26 billion by 2030, with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.5% during the forecast period from 2024 to 2030, per Verified Market Research.\n\nConsumer tastes and lifestyle changes are driving the market towards larger, more versatile, and rugged SUVs, moving away from sedans. The increasing popularity of SUVs is attributed to their perceived functionality for daily use and leisure travel. Safety features and advanced technologies are becoming crucial for SUV appeal, as consumers prioritize vehicles with cutting-edge safety features. The practicality and flexibility of SUVs, offering enhanced visibility, cargo capacity, and a strong road presence, are attracting a diverse range of buyers.\n\nUrbanization trends also play a role, as SUVs are seen as suitable city cars with off-road capabilities. Technological advancements such as fuel efficiency, infotainment systems, autonomous driving capabilities, and connectivity are appealing to tech-savvy buyers, while effective marketing strategies by manufacturers highlight the lifestyle and status associated with owning an SUV.\n\nWithin the broader SUV\u2019s market, electric SUVs are gaining popularity worldwide as countries like China and India focus on reducing vehicle emissions and increasing government support. These electric SUVs offer longer driving ranges, addressing range anxiety, and making them more suitable for daily use. For example, Mercedes-Benz recently introduced its all-electric SUV, the EQE 500 4Matic, in India. Priced at INR 13.9 million, it is the third electric vehicle in the manufacturer's Indian lineup. The company is also providing a 10-year warranty on the EV battery, marking a significant milestone for the brand.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe move towards electric vehicles (EVs) presents substantial changes. Traditional cars have a higher number of components compared to electric vehicles, resulting in increased assembly time. The United Auto Workers union is striving for fair wages and job security amidst worries that the transition may put 35,000 jobs at risk out of its 150,000 members due to potential effects on Detroit's 'Big Three' car manufacturers. The anticipated expansion of the global e-SUV market is expected to increase from $208.50 billion in 2023 to $524.26 billion by 2030, displaying a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1% throughout the forecast period.\n\nBefore we move to our list of SUVs With the Highest Resale Value in 2024, let\u2019s take a look at some major market players in the automotive industry.\n\nGlance at the Global Market Players in the Industry\n\nToyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM)\n\nToyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) sales performance showed positive growth across all regions during the period of April to December 2023. Increased sales of hybrid electric vehicles significantly contributed to the company's doubled profits. Toyota also revised its forecasts for the fiscal year 2024, projecting a sales revenue of US$293.1 billion by March 31, 2024.\n\nFrom April to December 2023, Toyota and Lexus collectively delivered over 7.9 million vehicles, marking a 9.7% increase from the previous year. Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) reported that electrified vehicles made up 35.9% of its total sales, including hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles, and fuel cell electric vehicles. Toyota's operating income for the same period saw a notable 102.1% increase year-on-year, primarily driven by the rise in overall sales, particularly in hybrid electric vehicles, with more than 2.64 million units sold, a 37.9% increase from 2022.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM)\n\nIn 2025, General Motors (NYSE:GM) will introduce the Cadillac Escalade IQ, an all-electric SUV boasting greater power than its current supercharged V-8 model and an estimated range of 450 miles. This electric vehicle is anticipated to be available in dealer showrooms in 2025, with an expected starting price of approximately $130,000. The three-row electric SUV serves as a significant milestone in demonstrating to investors General Motors' capability to produce profitable electric vehicles.\n\nIn the fourth quarter ending 31 December 2023, General Motors (NYSE:GM) disclosed a net income for stockholders of $2.1 billion, equating to $1.59 per share, as opposed to $2 billion, or $1.39 per share, in the previous year. Upon adjusting for one-time items, GM achieved an earnings per share of $1.24, surpassing projections on Wall Street. Revenue remained relatively consistent year over year, standing at $42.98 billion compared to $43.11 billion in the final quarter of 2022.\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQGS:TSLA)\n\nThe recently launched Model Y electric car by Tesla, under the leadership of Elon Musk, has made its debut in China in October 2023 featuring enhanced design and performance adjustments. Remarkably, the starting price remains unchanged at approximately $37,000. This release comes shortly after the introduction of the updated \"Highland\" Model 3 in China, which was also introduced in Europe a month earlier. As per information on Tesla's Chinese website, the Model Y now boasts a 0-60 mph acceleration time of 5.9 seconds.\n\nIn the fourth quarter ending 31 December 2023, Tesla disclosed revenue and profit figures that fell short of analysts' expectations, resulting in a nearly 6% decline in the stock price during after-hours trading. While automotive revenue experienced a modest 1% increase from the previous year, total revenue rose to $25.17 billion, marking a 3% growth from $24.3 billion in the prior year. The operating margin for the quarter was recorded at 8.2%, lower than the 16% reported a year ago but slightly higher than the 7.6% from the preceding quarter. 12 SUVs With the Highest Resale Value in 2024\n\nAn auto repair shop with a car in the foreground, demonstrating the need for comprehensive automobile coverage.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 12 SUVs with the Highest Resale Value in 2024, we conducted extensive research using diverse online sources that featured SUVs with the Highest Resale Value. After aggregating a significant number of SUVs based on their frequency across these sources, we developed a preliminary list. We then narrowed down the selection based on the Resale Scores provided by J.D. Power, a reputable authority in automotive data analysis. This Resale Score predicts a vehicle's future depreciation over the next three years, with higher ratings correlating to lower depreciation levels. We then ranked the list based on resale scores. In instances where multiple SUVs had the same Resale Score, we introduced tiebreaking to outrank them, which encompasses various factors such as quality, reliability and driving experience, as evaluated by J.D. Power.\n\nWith this, we present our list of 12 SUVs with the Highest Resale Value in 2024.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n12. Lexus GX 2023\n\nResale Score: 80\n\n12th on our list of SUVs with the Highest Resale Value in 2024 is 2023 Lexus GX, which stands out among mid-size luxury crossovers and SUVs for its impressive off-road capabilities and distinctive design features, including a bold grille and a well-designed interior. Despite its aging platform and technology, shared with the Toyota 4Runner, the GX's classic V-8 engine, and off-road features allow it to excel beyond paved roads. The optional Off-Road package further enhances its rugged abilities.\n\n11. Tesla Model Y 2023\n\nResale Score: 81\n\n2023 Tesla Model Y, though popular with buyers, and high on the Resale Score, falls short compared to its sedan counterpart, the Model 3. While offering respectable driving range among electric SUVs like the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Volkswagen ID.4, the Model Y feels less nimble on twisty roads and lacks the luxurious feel of its upscale competitors. The interior's use of lower-quality materials and reliance on a single infotainment screen may not meet the expectations of those considering luxury electric SUVs from brands like Audi, Cadillac, or Genesis.\n\n10. Lexus NX 350 2023\n\nResale Score: 82\n\nThe 2023 Lexus NX distinguishes itself from being just a revamped Toyota RAV4 by offering a luxurious design and a well-appointed cabin. Despite these positive aspects, it falls short of matching the driving dynamics of European competitors like the Audi Q3, BMW X1, and Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class. While the Lexus NX provides a range of powertrain options, including a powerful plug-in hybrid, it may not deliver the same level of driving enjoyment as some of its rivals. However, for those focused on practicality and everyday use, the NX remains a reliable choice for daily commutes, errands, and road trips. In addition, it is also on our list of SUVs with the Highest Resale Value in 2024 which is a plus point.\n\n9. Toyota Bz4X 2023\n\nResale Score: 83\n\n9th on our list of SUVs with the Highest Resale Value in 2024 is Toyota Bz4X 2023, which is re-entering the electric vehicle market with the 2023 bZ4X crossover, featuring a distinctive design that differs from Toyota's traditional gasoline-powered SUVs. It offers both front-wheel and all-wheel-drive options, with the former boasting a range of up to 252 miles per charge. While the bZ4X joins a competitive group of non-luxury EV SUVs, such as the Chevrolet Bolt EUV, Ford Mustang Mach E, Hyundai Kona Electric, Kia Niro EV, Tesla Model Y, and Volkswagen ID.4, its real-world highway range in testing reveals it lags behind some of its counterparts in this segment.\n\n8. 2024 Mazda CX-50\n\nResale Score: 84\n\nMazda's shift towards SUVs is evident, with the introduction of the 2024 CX-50 showcasing the brand's continued commitment to its \"zoom-zoom\" spirit. This compact crossover combines ruggedly stylish aesthetics with a luxurious interior without compromising on Mazda's signature nimble handling and driving excitement. The CX-50 satisfies the instinct of exploring without limits with an optional turbocharged engine that provides up to 256 hp and 320 lb-ft of torque, allowing one to explore wherever journey takes them. Competing in the same segment as popular models like the Honda CR-V and Volkswagen Tiguan, the CX-50 also faces competition from its own lineup, notably the Mazda CX-5. It is also 8th on our list of SUVs With the Highest Resale Value in 2024.\n\n7. Lexus RX 350 2023\n\nResale Score: 84\n\nFollowing a major redesign in 2023, the Lexus RX SUV maintains its smooth and comfortable ride, appealing to its loyal customer base. The lineup offers three powertrain options, with updated styling featuring a more modern look with a revised grille design and distinctive L-shaped running lights. The interior of the RX is now more refined, boasting a large infotainment touchscreen and cutting-edge technological features. Unlike the previous model, the 2023 RX is only available in a two-row configuration, though a three-row option may be introduced later, or Lexus may introduce a larger SUV with a standard seven-seat layout.\n\n6. Jeep Wrangler 2024\n\nResale Score: 86\n\nFor those who enjoy outdoor adventures or simply appreciate the rugged aesthetic, the 2024 Jeep Wrangler, 6th on our list of SUVs with the Highest Resale Value in 2024, offers versatile off-road capabilities. While Jeep now provides more comfort features and luxurious touches in higher trims, it still retains its rugged, truck-like characteristics. The Wrangler's ride might feel rough on uneven roads, requiring frequent steering corrections. In terms of refinement, competitors like the Ford Bronco and Toyota 4Runner offer smoother rides. However, Jeep stands out with a wide range of powertrain options, including a plug-in hybrid and a powerful V-8 engine exclusive to the Rubicon 392 model.\n\nClick to continue reading and find out about 5SUVs With the Highest Resale Value in 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n20 Most Affordable Cars to Buy in America in 2023 12 Countries that Produce the Most Cars in the World Top 20 Most Expensive Cars of All Time\n\nDisclosure: None. 12SUVs With the Highest Resale Value in 2024 is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In general, investors look at penny stocks for trading and speculation. Quick gains are an opportunity for exit and entry into another potentially speculative name. However, not all penny stocks are purely speculative or solely for short term trades. I see some millionaire-maker penny stocks that are worth buying and holding for the long term.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these millionaire-maker penny stocks represent companies that are at an early growth stage. These companies have ambitious plans and if the execution is good, sky is the limit for the stock.\n\nOf course, these stocks have high-risk and portfolio exposure must be restricted. However, even a limited exposure of 15% can change the shape of the portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis column discusses seven millionaire-maker penny stocks that represents companies with good fundamentals. While it\u2019s important to carefully monitor business developments, these stocks are worth holding for the next five years for millionaire-maker potential.\n\nBitfarms (BITF) Bitcoin and crypto mining farm. Big data center. High tech server computers at work. Bitfarms (BITF) mines crypto.\n\nSource: PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surging past $50,000, it\u2019s difficult to ignore crypto stocks.\n\nFurther, with Bitcoin halving due, it\u2019s likely that the momentum for the cryptocurrency will sustain. The long-term outlook is equally promising with Cathie Wood expecting Bitcoin to touch $1.5 million by 2030.\n\nI am therefore bullish on multi-bagger returns for some of the best Bitcoin mining stocks.\n\nBitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF) is an attractive bet among potential millionaire-maker penny stocks. Besides the tailwinds in the form of Bitcoin surging higher, the company has a strong balance sheet and aggressive growth plans.\n\nAs of January, Bitfarms reported hash rate capacity of 6.5EH/s. By the end of the year, the company is targeting capacity of 21EH/s.\n\nThis will translate into stellar revenue and cash flow upside. I must add here that Bitfarms has a debt-free balance sheet with a liquidity buffer of $118 million as of December 2023. Therefore, there is ample financial flexibility for investment in expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nTilray Brands (TLRY) Tilray (TLRY) logo on a web browser.\n\nSource: Jarretera / Shutterstock.com\n\nTilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) is another name among millionaire-maker penny stocks.\n\nAfter an extended period of downturn for cannabis stocks, I am bullish on the sector for the coming years. Assuming that cannabis is legalized at the federal level, TLRY stock can be an easy 10-bagger in the next 24 months.\n\nI must add that even without legalization, the U.S. cannabis market is likely to be worth $71 billion by 2030. Further, the European medicinal cannabis market is likely to be big in the coming years. Therefore, there is ample headroom for growth and value creation.\n\nTilray Brands was focused on diversification in 2023. The company is now the fifth largest craft beer brewer in the U.S. because of acquisitions.\n\nThe acquisitions have improved the company\u2019s strategic infrastructure in the country, in addition to diversifying its operations. This will enable aggressive expansion if cannabis is legalized at the federal level.\n\nFor Q2 2024, Tilray reported record net revenue and a year-on-year growth of 34%. Further, the company has also guided for positive adjusted free cash flow in the current financial year. With all these positives, TLRY stock is likely to go ballistic.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) Person holding smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium stocks have been depressed and looks undervalued after a big correction. It\u2019s likely that lithium price recovery will be gradual. However, the long-term outlook is positive with a significant impending supply-gap.\n\nIt\u2019s therefore a good time to invest in some of the best lithium stocks with millionaire-maker potential. Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) looks attractive at a current market valuation of $743 million. I would bet on 10x to 20x returns for this stock in the next five years.\n\nFor Lithium Americas, the Thacker Pass project is a value creator. The asset has a mine life of 40-years with the company expecting an average annual EBITDA of $1.1 billion. With an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion, the deep valuation gap is clear.\n\nThe Thacker Pass project funding seems secure with General Motors (NYSE:GM) committing to invest $650 million in two tranches. GM also has an offtake agreement for 10 years from phase one of production.\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) a blink charging station, BLNK stock\n\nSource: David Tonelson/Shutterstock.com\n\nBlink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) is among the few emerging names in the EV charging industry that\u2019s likely to create massive value. An important point to note is that investments in charging infrastructure needs to accelerate to achieve the target of 30\u201342 million EVs on U.S. roads. Therefore, there is ample scope for growth through the decade.\n\nSpecific to Blink Charging, the revenue growth trajectory has been stellar. For Q3 2023, the company reported revenue growth of 152% on a year-on-year basis to $43.4 million.\n\nRecently, the company announced preliminary numbers for Q4 2023 and it has exceeded the guidance. Blink expects full-year revenue to surpass $140 million. The company has reaffirmed the guidance for positive Adjusted EBITDA run rate by December 2024.\n\nConsidering the revenue growth trajectory, it\u2019s likely that EBITDA margin expansion will be significant in the next 24 to 36 months. A sustained increase in service revenue will also support margin expansion. Overall, the worst seems to be over for BLNK stock and I expect multi-bagger returns from current levels.\n\nYatra Online (YTRA) Plane travel. Man standing in airport waiting for flight. travel stocks to buy\n\nSource: Olena Yakobchuk / Shutterstock\n\nYatra Online (NASDAQ:YTRA) is an online travel company with a focus on the Indian markets. The company is a provider of air ticketing, hotel packages, and related services.\n\nWith a big addressable market in an emerging economy, I am bullish on YTRA stock creating immense value.\n\nThe company has differentiated itself from competition to emerge as the largest corporate travel player in India. Yatra has a customer base of 800 corporates with an addressable employee base of more than seven million.\n\nYatra is also scaling-up its business-to-consumer segment. In terms of consumer brand awareness, Yatra is only behind MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) in India. With the economy growing at a healthy pace and with a swelling middle-class, there is ample scope for growth.\n\nFor Q3 2024, Yatra reported 23% year-on-year growth in revenue to $13.4 million. For the same period, the company achieved positive adjusted EBITDA. With a robust growth outlook, I expect meaningful EBITDA margin expansion in the coming quarters.\n\nBlade Air Mobility (BLDE) The Blade Air Mobility (BLDE) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlade Air Mobility (NASDAQ:BLDE) stock is among the under-the-radar penny stocks that seems poised for multibagger returns.\n\nThe company is a provider of air transport alternatives to congested ground routes in the United States. These services are provided through charter flights, helicopters, and seaplanes. However, Blade Air has an asset-light business model.\n\nThe company is on a high-growth trajectory. For Q3 2023, Blade Air reported 56% growth in revenue on a year-on-year basis to $71.4 million. It was also the first quarter where the company reported positive adjusted EBITDA and free cash flows.\n\nBesides providing air transport to customers, Blade Air is also involved in the transportation of human organs for transplant in the United States. The company recently launched its new organ matching service.\n\nWith cost efficiencies coupled with a focus on the organ transportation segment, the company expects \u201csignificant year-over-year improvement in Adjusted EBITDA.\u201d As margin expands in the coming quarters coupled with strong revenue growth, I expect BLDE stock to surge higher.\n\nIAMGOLD (IAG) An image of multiple gold bars. Gold prices\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI am bullish on gold considering the factors of geopolitical tensions, inflation, and the likelihood of expansionary monetary policies. Among penny gold mining stocks, IAMGOLD (NYSE:IAG) stock looks attractive and is poised for multi-bagger returns.\n\nAn important catalyst for IAMGOLD in 2024 and beyond is the commencement of production from the Cote gold mine. For 2023, the company reported attributable gold production from continuing operations of 465,000 ounces.\n\nExcluding Cote, IAMGOLD has guided for attributable gold production (mid-range) of 460,000 ounces this year. However, if Cote production is included, the attributable production for the year is likely to increase to 715,000 ounces.\n\nClearly, IAMGOLD is positioned for stellar production growth. If this is associated with higher realized gold price, I expect a strong jump in revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flows. I must add that IAMGOLD has a strong liquidity buffer of $755 million as of December 2023.\n\nWith visibility for healthy cash flows, financial flexibility remains high for aggressive exploration activity and potential acquisitions.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 22, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights HCA Healthcare HCA, DaVita DVA and General Motors GM.\n\nMarkets Vulnerable? Hide in 3 Top-Ranked Defensive Stocks\n\nThe stock market has moved aggressively higher since the start of the year with the S&P 500 gaining 4.6% YTD and the Nasdaq 100 5.2%. While there is nothing inherently wrong with the market showing such strength, there are a few concerning developments brewing that may lead to at least a minor correction in the coming weeks.\n\nBecause of these developments, I am turning my focus to some more defensive stocks which I will share here.\n\nChannel Breakdown\n\nIn the chart below we can see that the Nasdaq 100 has been trading almost perfectly up and to the right for the last three and a half months. But volatility has begun to pick up, and the index has now broken down below the lower bound of this upward trending channel.\n\nThese channel breakdowns can often be an early signal for more volatility, and so long as the market is below this level, I remain cautious. There is a similar setup in the S&P 500 as well.\n\nRates and Inflation\n\nPart of what powered the stock market rally over the last three months was the growing expectation that the Fed would be cutting interest rates early in 2024. But it seems we may be kicking the can down the road.\n\nAt the last CPI data release, we learned that inflation was hotter than expected, indicating that there may be some risk of cutting rates too early. Additionally, the employment data has also consistently shown that the labor market is extremely strong.\n\nBecause it appears that the economy is still in expansion, even with high interest rates, there is very little pressure on the central bank to rush and lower interest rates, and in fact there may be a risk of causing the economy to overheat if they do it too soon.\n\nJust a month ago, futures markets were pricing in the first rate cut at the March meeting, and a second rate cut at the May meeting, but both of those are now off the table. This is already a big reversal in interest rate expectations and the \u2018higher for longer\u2019 narrative could be a catalyst for a further market selloff.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeasonality\n\nLast year we learned just how influential the seasonal trends of the market can be, as equities followed them almost perfectly all year. If you respect the market\u2019s seasonality, you should be concerned about the next month.\n\nThe S&P 500 has just entered what is often the most volatile period of the year. Now through mid-March has the potential to bring some considerable selling.\n\nLeading Stocks Reverting\n\nA lot of the upside action in markets has been taking place in the high velocity, high growth technology and Artificial Intelligence adjacent stocks. Namely Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Nvidia (NVDA) have made truly stunning moves in just the last six weeks, with SMCI rallying as much as 280%, only to fall more than -30% in just the last week.\n\nBut there are other cracks forming in these leading sectors. Cloud and cyber security stocks have also been major contributors to the rally, and just this morning, one of the leading names got hit hard. Palo Alto, for instance, got hammered -30% this morning after cutting guidance.\n\nThe mean reversion occurring in these high momentum stocks has me looking for low-risk, secure, non-cyclical stocks to rotate into.\n\nTop Ranked Stocks for Defense\n\nNow all these factors together don\u2019t necessarily mean there is a stock market crash around the corner. The economy is strong, the Fed will be cutting rates later this year, and we are likely in a longer-term bull market that started last year.\n\nHowever, even bull markets can have pullbacks of 5-10%, and for investors looking to get tactically defensive, now is a good time to initiate that plan.\n\nOne of the first places I like to look for defensive stocks is the healthcare sector. Medical stocks have non-cyclical characteristics, and regularly outperform the market during periods of elevated volatility. Even better if I can find ones that have a top Zacks Rank and are showing relative strength against the market.\n\nThe two healthcare stocks that I am looking at are HCA Healthcare and DaVita. Both stocks have Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings and are industry leading names.\n\nHCA Healthcare is the largest non-governmental operator of acute care hospitals in the US and enjoys a steady earnings revisions trend, and reasonable growth estimates in the coming years. Furthermore, the price action in the stock has been forming a convincing bullish pattern.\n\nIf HCA stock can breakout above the $310 level, it should send it to new highs.\n\nDaVita, the country\u2019s leading provider of dialysis care has a very similar setup to HCA Healthcare. In addition to a steady earnings revision trend, and strong EPS growth estimates, the DaVita has a reasonable valuation of 13.7x forward earnings.\n\nIt also has a clean technical trade setup like HCA. After gapping up following earnings, DaVita stock has been building out a bull flag. A move above the $123.50 level would signal a breakout, and likely draw in buyers.\n\nAnd finally, the last defensive stock pick is General Motors. In addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, demonstrated by upward trending earnings revisions, the stock has a rock-bottom valuation. General Motors has a one year forward earnings multiple of just 4.3x. And with EPS growth estimates of 9% annually over the next 3-5 years, that gives GM a PEG Ratio of just 0.48x, indicating deep value based on the metric.\n\nLike the others, General Motors stock also boasts a clean technical trading setup. Just today, GM stock broke out from a bull flag, and looks primed for a big move higher. What makes this strength even more impressive is that the stock is strong while the broad market is selling off today.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAs is clear from the above write-up, there are at least a few developments in this market that are concerning. From interest rates to technical breakdowns, and we haven\u2019t even mentioned the geopolitical tensions and approaching US presidential election, which only add to the uncertainty.\n\nWe also have to wait and see earnings from Nvidia today after the close, which is probably the most important earnings event of the season.\n\nNonetheless, even with all these bearish catalysts building there is always a bull market somewhere, you just have to dig.\n\nBest of luck trading!\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Just Bought These 16 Stocks. Here Are the Best of the Bunch.",
        "content": "Billionaires march to the beat of their own drums. As a case in point, just look at the recent trades made by Warren Buffett and David Tepper.\n\nBuffett didn't initiate any new positions for Berkshire Hathaway in the fourth quarter of 2023. He added to only three of Berkshire's existing holdings.\n\nTepper, on the other hand, bought a whopping 16 stocks for his Appaloosa Management hedge fund -- including nine new positions. Here are all of the stocks the billionaire hedge fund manager bought, along with the ones I think are the best of the bunch.\n\nAdding to his stake\n\nLike many investors, Tepper has ridden the artificial intelligence (AI) wave in a big way. He continued to do so in Q4, buying additional shares of three AI stocks.\n\nMicrosoft ranked as Appaloosa's second-largest holding at the end of Q4. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) trailed not too far behind at No. 3. Tepper increased his hedge fund's stake in both stocks during Q4. He also scooped up additional shares of Chinese tech stock Alibaba Group Holding, which is investing heavily in AI.\n\nThe billionaire investor decided to increase Appaloosa's positions in a couple of energy stocks during Q4. Tepper bumped up his hedge fund's stake in Antero Resources a bit. He also significantly expanded his holdings of midstream energy company MPLX(NYSE: MPLX).\n\nWhat happens in Vegas doesn't always stay in Vegas. Tepper bought more shares of casino and hotel operator Caesars Entertainment in Q4, as well.\n\nNewly initiated positions\n\nTepper found plenty of new stocks that he liked in the fourth quarter. Only one of them has a connection with AI, though. Oracle achieved success with its relational database management system but is now a big player in cloud infrastructure and AI. Tepper initiated a new position in the stock, buying nearly 1.33 million shares.\n\nThe hedge fund CEO was even more bullish about manufacturing stocks. In Q4, Tepper added positions in chemical manufacturer FMC, appliance manufacturer Whirlpool, flooring manufacturer Mohawk Industries, auto manufacturer General Motors(NYSE: GM), home improvement and home construction products manufacturer Masco, and insulation, roofing, and fiberglass products manufacturer Owens Corning.\n\nStory continues\n\nTepper also opened up new positions during Q4 in shipping and logistics giant United Parcel Service and railroad company Norfolk Southern. He delved into the healthcare sector, as well, initiating a stake in hospital operator HCA Healthcare.\n\nBest of the bunch\n\nWhich of Tepper's purchases in Q4 are the best of the bunch? I think the answer depends on your investing style.\n\nIncome investors will no doubt like MPLX's ultra-high distribution yield of over 8.7%. The midstream energy company is delivering surprisingly strong earnings growth. I expect that MPLX will continue to grow its distribution and cash flow over the next few years.\n\nValue investors won't find many stocks cheaper than General Motors. The automaker sports a super-low forward earnings multiple of only 4.3x.\n\nImportantly, GM has led the industry in combined pickup, full-size van, and full-size SUV sales (the most lucrative market segments) for 10 years in a row. It also topped the industry in initial quality, based on J.D. Power's ratings for the second consecutive year.\n\nWhich Tepper pick is the best choice for growth investors? This is a harder decision. I like the prospects for Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle, thanks to AI tailwinds for all three companies. Long-term investors will probably reap solid gains with any of these stocks.\n\nIf I had to pick just one of them, though, I'd go with Amazon. I think the company has tremendous opportunities with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit. I also like the company's booming advertising business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \r\n\r\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Yijing Brentano, Senior Vice President of Strategy, Corporate Development and Investor Relations for Gentherm. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nYijing H. Brentano\n\nThank you and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Gentherm's earnings results were released earlier this morning, and a copy of the release is available at gentherm.com. Additionally, a webcast replay of today's call will be available later today on the Investor Relations section of Gentherm's website.\r\n\r\nDuring this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance, and actual results may differ materially. We undertake no obligation to update them, except as required by law. Please see Gentherm's earnings release and its SEC filings, including the latest 10-K and subsequent reports, for discussions of our risk factors and other risks and uncertainties underlying such forward-looking statements.\r\n\r\nDuring the call, we may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G, including certain pro forma measures related to the Alfmeier acquisition.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.\r\n\r\nLet me start with Slide 4 for our 2023 highlights. I'm extremely proud of what the Gentherm team achieved in 2023 despite a continuously challenging operating environment. Demand for our thermal comfort, massage and lumbar solutions continues to accelerate. We secured new automotive business awards of $900 million in the fourth quarter, which brings us to $2.6 billion in 2023, setting a new quarterly and annual record.\r\n\r\nOur strong award momentum continued to drive revenue growth. We achieved record revenue for automotive, medical and total company for the full year 2023. In addition, we also achieved record annual revenue for climate controlled seats, seat heaters and steering wheel heaters in 2023. It's it's worth noting that adjusting for the impact from foreign exchange, the UAW strike and one-time recoveries, our core thermal product lines include CCS, seat heaters and steering wheel heaters, outperformed the production in our relevant markets by nearly 400 basis points in 2023.\r\n\r\nOn the cost front, we continued our disciplined approach to managing operating expenses. We've reduced adjusted operating expense as a percent of revenue from 20% in 2018 when we launched our first Fit-for-Growth initiative to 16% in 2023. We delivered the highest annual adjusted EBITDA in company history, an increase of more than 30% compared to 2022. And we generated nearly $120 million of cash flow from operations and repurchased over $90 million worth of Gentherm shares. The new business wins, record revenues in key product lines, improved profitability and solid cash flow generation demonstrates strong execution by the Gentherm team.\r\n\r\nNow turning to Slide 5. Let me highlight a few key pillars that drove our record $2.6 billion in new automotive awards in 2023. First, at the top left of the slide, our core thermal products continue to expand globally, particularly in high content product categories such as CCS and hands-on detection-enabled steering wheel heaters. We won awards in 2023 which spanned across all ranges of vehicles from the likes of BMW, Cadillac, Mazda and Li Auto and BYD in China.\r\n\r\nSecond, in pneumatic lumbar and massage, we are growing our market share and winning awards at a rate that is well above our original expectations. We have won conquest pneumatic lumbar and massage awards with BMW, General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover, Li Auto, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, Volkswagen and one of the largest global EV manufacturers. These wins confirm the strength of our combined product offering, leveraging the Alfmeier acquisition. It's important to point out that a growing number of OEM customers want the combined thermal and pneumatic lumbar product, especially from an independent supplier who integrates with many seating providers. This is one of the unique value propositions that Gentherm offers.\r\n\r\nLet me remind you of a few key combined awards that we have won since the beginning of 2023. We won the highly desirable and contested award with BMW for CCS, seat heat and pneumatic lumbar and massage for their next-generation electric and ICE X Series SUVs, which include the X5, 6 and 7 and the iX5, 6 and 7. We won a combined CCS, seat heat, lumbar and massage full system award with Jaguar Land Rover for their new Jaguar BEVs. We've significantly grown our content with one of the largest global EV manufacturers, winning steering wheel heat, seat heat, CCS and pneumatic lumbar awards across multiple car lines. Finally, we won 3 CCS awards with Li Auto on their plug-in hybrid L9 and 2 future electric SUVs. In addition, we won 2 combined CCS and pneumatic massage awards from Li Auto on a future electric and plug-in hybrid SUV.\r\n\r\nMoving to the bottom left on Slide 5, our proprietary innovations such as ClimateSense and WellSense, which I will elaborate more on the next slide, have helped us to increase content per vehicle. For example, our ongoing ClimateSense development project with Honda has demonstrated significant savings in HVAC energy consumption by combining seat heat, steering wheel heat and interior heat. As a result, Honda awarded Gentherm multiple EV programs that include both heated interior solutions and our electronic control units. As we shared on the last earnings call, we won our first multifunction electronic control unit award from General Motors.\r\n\r\nAnd today, I'm pleased to announce one of the most important strategic awards in Gentherm's history. In the fourth quarter, we won a breakthrough, scalable ClimateSense software award for nearly all future architecture General Motors ICE and electric vehicles. Through this award, Gentherm's proprietary ClimateSense software features will be enabled across all General Motors vehicles equipped with seat heat, climate controlled seats and steering wheel heating. This will allow Gentherm's intelligent software solutions to bring increased comfort control and energy efficiency.\r\n\r\nLet me summarize my discussion regarding our award momentum by reminding you of a key differentiator for our company. Gentherm is an independent partner that can cooperate with any combination of the 50-plus vehicle OEMs and 30-plus seat manufacturers globally, including those that are vertically integrated, to create truly differentiated solutions. Our unique value proposition resonates with customers as demonstrated by our win rate of approximately 80% of our quoted pursuits for thermal and pneumatic solutions in 2023.\r\n\r\nTurning to Slide 6. Let me share a little more on how we're leading the industry in key innovations, starting with ClimateSense, the world's first scalable software-driven automotive microclimate solution. It uniquely delivers personalized thermal comfort for each occupant in the car by coordinating localized convective, conductive and radiant heating and cooling to provide optimal comfort while also reducing vehicle energy consumption and extending range. ClimateSense software seamlessly integrates with vehicle and HVAC controls to optimize the temperature for passengers individually.\r\n\r\nIn addition to ClimateSense, our advanced engineering team continues to integrate our thermal products with lumbar and massage products to create innovative, full system solutions. The combination of heating and cooling the body with massage, including our industry's first proprietary pulsating massage, Pulse A, is opening vast opportunities for solutions that promote health and wellness experiences, also alertness enhancements and physical recovery in the car.\r\n\r\nAs a result, at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, we unveiled WellSense, a software-defined consumer experience that delivers customized in-cabin comfort sensations that promote alertness, wellness and wellbeing. It was great to see some of you at our booth, experiencing WellSense firsthand. The technology leverages science-based physiology research as the foundation for proprietary software that orchestrates heating, cooling, lumbar and massage comfort effectors. The WellSense software development kit, which includes over-the-air feature upgrades, can be integrated into any software-defined vehicle architecture.\r\n\r\nTrends are shifting towards consumers using their vehicles as a third living space outside the home or office, offering an additional revenue opportunity for OEMs to address consumer health and wellness needs. The launch of our proprietary WellSense is the next evolution of our software-enabled technologies, which positions Gentherm at the nexus of health, wellness, comfort and energy efficiency.\r\n\r\nLastly, I'd like to officially introduce our next-generation integrated thermal lumbar and massage hardware system, ComfortScale. ComfortScale is a modular solution, which combines several distinct thermal and pneumatic comfort components into one integrated system. We believe ComfortScale will drive significant performance improvement for our customers as well as labor cost and logistics reduction for the OEMs and seat manufacturers. ComfortScale can be integrated with any foam and with any seat. It's adaptable for all OEMs and all Tier 1 seat manufacturers. It's scalable from an entry-level lumbar and seat heat system all the way to a high-end Pulse A massage and CCS system.\r\n\r\nI'm proud of the Gentherm technology team for bringing to market innovative, differentiated proprietary solutions such as ClimateSense, WellSense and ComfortScale. These innovations are expected to significantly increase Gentherm's content per vehicle and position us to be a strong contributor to software-defined vehicles of the future.\r\n\r\nNow turning to our Q4 automotive highlights on Slide 7. In the fourth quarter, we launched our automotive solutions on 21 different vehicles across 13 OEMs, including BMW, Ford, Geely, Toyota and Volkswagen. We continue to see expanded application of our CCS solutions. In the fourth quarter, our CCS solutions were launched on the Ford Ranger, Mazda CX-90, Toyota Tacoma and the BEV truck with one of the largest global EV manufacturers.\r\n\r\nI'm pleased to share that Gentherm's ClimateSense was named a finalist for the prestigious 2023 Automotive News PACE Awards, with winners to be announced in April of 2024. In the fourth quarter, Gentherm was also named a winner of the Business Intelligence Group 2024 Big Innovation Award for our ClimateSense technology. And ClimateSense was also recognized as a winner of the 2023 Reuters DRIVE Honour in the reducing emissions category. These awards are clear recognitions of the impact ClimateSense can deliver through personalized comfort and reduced vehicle energy consumption. I'd like to congratulate the Gentherm team for receiving these coveted recognitions.\r\n\r\nNow onto Slide 8, where as I mentioned, we secured a quarterly record of $900 million of awards in automotive in the fourth quarter. We received 8 steering wheel heater awards across 7 OEMs. Importantly, we won hands-on detection-enabled steering wheel heater awards with BMW, Geely, General Motors, Li Auto and Nissan. We won several CCS awards in the quarter. Of note, we won the new Hyundai Grandeur, Hyundai QV, the Kia EV5, Nissan X-Trail, a midsized crossover for one of the largest global EV manufacturers, a new Great Wall plug-in hybrid SUV and the new Rivian electric delivery van.\r\n\r\nI'm also pleased to share that we are growing our business with our largest customer, General Motors, winning a highly contested CCS and multifunction electronic control unit awards for their next-generation truck platform, including the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we also won our first ClimateSense software award for nearly all future architecture General Motors ICE and electric vehicles that will enable ClimateSense to control thermal seating and steering wheels. This is truly a breakthrough win for Gentherm that showcases the value our proprietary software provides for our customers.\r\n\r\nWith software-defined vehicles expected to grow in the global market in the coming years, Gentherm is perfectly positioned to increase hardware and software content to enable greater energy efficiency, personalization and novel comfort and wellness experiences. These wins confirm our strong market-leading position in thermal and pneumatic comfort. I'd like to recognize the global Gentherm team for securing a company record of $2.6 billion of new automotive business awards in 2023.\r\n\r\nNow before I discuss the medical highlights, I'd like to provide a brief update on our Battery Performance Solutions. If you recall, Gentherm invented an innovative and proprietary thin foil, flexible circuit product line that can be used as either a battery cell heater or a cell connecting device. However, in the past year, we have not secured any new cell connecting awards based on the mechanical structuring process. There are 2 fundamental reasons for this. First, OEMs and battery makers are becoming more conservative in both technology selection and pace of production for EVs. Customers are choosing to remain with the current chemical-etched and wire-based connection solutions despite the environmental and technical benefits of our technology.\r\n\r\nSecond, where we have had the opportunity to win, the margin and return profiles would have been well below our company business case requirements. Consequently, we have decided to pause our pursuit of cell-connecting opportunities for the foreseeable future. Although we will continue to pursue select battery heating and cooling opportunities, we expect our BPS revenue to gradually decrease over the next few years. We've reassigned the majority of our BPS resources to work on our unprecedented new business awards in thermal, pneumatic and electronics.\r\n\r\nNow let's turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of our medical business. The medical team delivered record revenue in 2023 with a strong finish in the fourth quarter, growing 15% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we added 26 new hospital customers in China, including Tung Shin, a top tier hospital. In the U.S., we successfully launched a group buy program with one of our key customers, HealthTrust Performance Group. We were awarded Blanketrol system upgrades throughout their member hospitals in the fourth quarter. And in Europe, we have converted competitors' convective warming accounts to resistive technology with our ASTOPAD as a result of increased demand for more sustainable solutions.\r\n\r\nAs we shared on previous earnings calls, we've adapted our go-to-market model in the medical business to leverage large partnerships, distribution channels and white label opportunities. Consequently, we have reduced the size of our in-house sales team to improve our cost structure in medical. And we are laser focused on growing both the top and bottom line in this business.\r\n\r\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Matteo for a little more color on the financial results and to discuss 2024 guidance.\n\nMatteo Anversa\n\nOkay. Thank you, Phil. Let me start on Slide 10 and focus on the most significant items in our fourth quarter results.\r\n\r\nFor the quarter, product revenues increased by 7% compared to the same period of last year. If we adjust for the impact of foreign exchange, our overall product revenue increased by 5%. Starting with the automotive segment. Automotive revenues were $354 million, reflecting a 7% increase compared to the prior year period. Adjusting for positive foreign currency translation and excluding the negative impact of the UAW strike, phasing out of the non-automotive electronics business, as well as one-time benefits from recoveries in both periods, automotive revenues increased 10% against a difficult prior-year comparison.\r\n\r\nActual light vehicle production in our key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea increased 13% year-over-year. It is worth noting that our regional revenue mix is different from the actual production market. Adjusting for our regional revenue mix, primarily as a result of our smaller percentage of revenue from China, our revenue growth would have outperformed production growth by approximately 150 basis points.\r\n\r\nWe saw growth in the majority of our product lines, and more specifically, our steering wheel heaters revenue increased by 22% compared to the prior year period due to higher demand of our hands-on detection-enabled steering wheel heaters with VW and Buick. Automotive cables revenue increased by 15% due to higher volume with Bosch and Samsung. EPS revenue increased 11% due to higher volume with Mercedes primarily delayed timing from the third quarter as well as higher price recoveries.\r\n\r\nCCS revenues increased by 6% due to higher volume with Hyundai, Kia, BMW and the start of production at one of the largest global EV manufacturers. Seat heater revenue increased by 5% due to the ramp-up on our electric vehicle for a global EV manufacturer in Europe and the ramp-up of the MLA platform with GLR. Lumbar and massage revenue increased by 3% due to the start of production on vehicles with BMW and VW in Europe as well as higher volumes with Ford. Valve systems revenue increased by 1% due to the higher sales in Europe. Electronics revenue decreased 9% due to the phaseout of non-automotive electronics. And other automotive revenue decreased by 8%, primarily due to the material inflation recoveries received in the prior year period.\r\n\r\nTurning to the medical business. Medical revenues increased 15%, primarily as a result of the higher Blanketrol sales in the U.S.\r\n\r\nMoving to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $49 million, up from $41 million in the prior year period. The adjusted EBITDA rate for the fourth quarter was 13.4%, the highest profitability rate in 8 quarters. This compares to 11.9% in the year-ago period. The 150 basis point year-over-year improvement was driven by lower freight cost, fixed cost leverage on higher sales volume, productivity at the manufacturing facilities and supplier cost reductions. These were partially offset by wage inflation and lower price recoveries relative to the prior year period. It is worth noting that sequentially, adjusted EBITDA margin rate rose 40 basis points, driven by higher manufacturing productivity and supplier cost reductions.\r\n\r\nOperating expenses were $64.6 million in the quarter compared to $66.2 million in the prior year period. If we adjust for acquisition, integration and restructuring costs as well as non-cash stock compensation expenses in both periods, operating expenses were $59.5 million, up from $52.8 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase of approximately $7 million was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation, partially offset by higher R&D reimbursement.\r\n\r\nFinally, adjusted diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $0.90 per share compared to $0.47 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. Our effective tax rate for the year, adjusted by the impact of the medical goodwill impairment recorded in the second quarter, was approximately 23%. This amount is lower than the guided range of 28% to 32% due to the one-time benefit as a result of a tax entity restructuring in Europe that was implemented in the fourth quarter of the year.\r\n\r\nMoving to the balance sheet on Slide 11. Our cash position at the end of the quarter was approximately $150 million, and our net debt stood at $73 million. Net debt increased sequentially by $20 million due to the $61 million share repurchases executed in the fourth quarter, partially offset by cash generated from operating activities. Our net leverage ratio was 0.4x at the end of the fourth quarter, well below our target of 1.5x. Based on the trailing 12-month consolidated adjusted EBITDA ended December 31, we had $278 million of remaining availability on our line of credit, and the total available liquidity as of year end 2023 was $428 million.\r\n\r\nNow before I discuss the 2024 guidance, I would like to thank the global Gentherm team for the disciplined financial management in 2023 that allowed us to deliver a 200 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin rate year-over-year on a pro forma basis, despite significant inflationary headwind. In addition, I'm proud of the team for the strong free cash flow generation, which enabled us to return approximately $90 million to our shareholders through share repurchases.\r\n\r\nNow let me turn to Slide 12 for our 2024 guidance. We are expecting revenue to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, assuming a euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.1 and light vehicle production in our relevant markets decreasing at a low single-digit rate in 2024 versus 2023. Adjusting for approximately 50 basis points of FX benefit year-over-year, the midpoint of our guidance implies an organic revenue growth rate of 5%. It is worth noting that if we exclude BPS, automotive cables and valve systems, our climate and comfort revenues are expected to grow more than 8%, excluding foreign exchange.\r\n\r\nOur guidance assumes higher revenue in the second half compared to the first half as a result of the timing of new program launches. Adjusted EBITDA margin rate is expected to improve to 12.5% to 13.5%. Our guidance assumes a 50 basis point headwind associated with the startup costs at our new plant in Morocco and Mexico and product engineering and launch costs associated with our record new awards.\r\n\r\nDue to the revenue cadence I mentioned earlier and the impact of contractual price downs, which will be offset in the second half of the year by supplier cost improvements and productivity actions, we expect the adjusted EBITDA margin rate in the first quarter to be below our full year guidance range and for the rate to steadily improve throughout the year. As a result of above mentioned items and one-time costs associated with our new plants, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin rate in the first quarter of 2024 to be slightly lower than the first quarter of 2023.\r\n\r\nOur full year effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 26% to 29% and capital expenditures to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million. 2024 CapEx will be higher than prior years due to increased investments for the ramp-up of new capacity, including the 2 new clients to support our record new awards.\r\n\r\nDue to our decision to pause the pursuit of BPS cell connecting board opportunities that Phil mentioned earlier, combined with the decline in vehicle production forecast in our largest region of North America, as well as the uncertainty on the timing of ramp-up of electric vehicles, we are revising our 2026 outlook that we provided in our strategy discussion in February of last year. We now expect 2026 revenue to be between $1.9 billion to $2 billion. And as a result of the reduction in the revenue outlook, adjusted EBITDA margin rate is now expected to be approximately 16% in 2026.\r\n\r\nWe continue to execute on our Fit-for-Growth initiatives, and specifically, we are targeting $80 million net savings by 2026 across workstreams, including SG&A, sourcing excellence, value engineering, manufacturing footprint, automation and product profitability. In 2023, the team delivered over $10 million of savings, and we are currently implementing additional projects that will yield another $45 million of savings by 2026. These actions are expected to deliver nearly 70% of our $80 million goal. And in addition, we have a pipeline of projects that positions us to achieve the remaining 30%. As we continue to identify and implement additional Fit-for-Growth actions, we gain momentum on our path to a high teens adjusted EBITDA margin rate over time.\r\n\r\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to Phil for some closing remarks.\n\nPhillip M. Eyler\n\nThanks, Matteo. Now let me summarize on Slide 13. I want to thank the global Gentherm team for continued strong execution in 2023, delivering record new business wins, record revenues and record adjusted EBITDA. In 2024, our climate and comfort business is expected to grow more than 8% with expanding margins.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish this and our long-term growth, we're laser focused on 3 priorities in 2024. First, we're confident in our ability to continue the strong momentum of winning new automotive business awards and maintaining our industry-leading market share, given our large pipeline of opportunities. We will also execute on our unprecedented award backlog to ensure a successful ramp-up with our key customers. Second, as Matteo just mentioned, we will execute on Fit-for-Growth initiatives to expand margins in the near term and position the company to achieve high teens adjusted EBITDA margin rate over time. And third, we will aggressively bring to market and expand our industry-leading and proprietary next-generation solutions such as ClimateSense, WellSense, Pulse A massage and ComfortScale.\r\n\r\nNow let me wrap up with Gentherm's unique investment thesis on Slide 14. First, we're a pure play leader in thermal and pneumatic comfort. It's also important to highlight the benefit of being independent. We can work with any OEM and any seat manufacturer to create scores of innovative and unique configuration and solve for all of their applications. Second, the global automotive market is large, and more importantly, the thermal and pneumatic comfort market is growing at a much faster pace than the automotive market. We expect to see a much higher rate of adoption of our products into vehicles, and we're extremely well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. Third, we provide unique, innovative and energy-efficient solutions that are key to the vehicles of the future. Our technology is best-in-class and often a generation ahead of our competition. Finally, our track record of execution against our strategy along with our robust financial discipline will enable us to deliver high-return growth outpacing the market.\r\n\r\nNow with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to start the Q&A.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Matt Koranda with ROTH MKM.\n\nMatthew Butler Koranda\n\nI want to start off with the awards. So just wanted to start out with the award environment and the $900 million in awards that you reported for the fourth quarter. Looks like a pretty big uptick sequentially and year-over-year. Just wanted to get a sense for how much of that was combined thermal and pneumatic technology in the awards. And then also on the GM award, just wanted to clarify what exactly you mean by the term architecture. Not to dumb it down too much, but do you just mean GM vehicles that incorporate multiple Gentherm products like steering wheel heat and CCS, et cetera? Just a bit more on that software solution and sort of what it does for your growth for the next few years would be helpful.\n\nPhillip M. Eyler\n\nThanks, Matt. I'll start with the first question on the awards mix. It's probably better to put it in terms of the full year than just a specific quarter. But as we pointed out, our pneumatic business is growing at a faster rate than we expected. Consumer pull, especially from our traditional Gentherm long-standing customers to replace other competitors and to grow in those customers has been tremendous. And definitely, as I pointed out with some of the examples, we're seeing this gradual shift to combined solutions for multiple reasons. The efficiency of supply and supply chain plus improved performance being the primary drivers. But if you look at the total awards for the year, we would have had a record on the thermal products alone, and then of course, add on top of that the growing pneumatics and combined awards, really a tremendous year. And the pipeline is still strong going forward.\r\n\r\nSo shifting to -- let me shift to the ClimateSense question with General Motors. Essentially, what this means is that our ClimateSense software will be embedded in nearly all vehicles of the GM future architecture in the future. And that's really the way they're designing their vehicle around allowing these kinds of features to be more prevalent. So we're really excited about it. It really unlocks the ability to orchestrate any thermal seating or steering wheel application and really fits into our scalable view of how we're implementing ClimateSense so that really ClimateSense is going to be the fundamental control of these microclimate devices. And that will help us to scale the content from, I would say, today's kind of normal CCS all the way up to that full content of ClimateSense over time with that customer. Hope that helps.\n\nMatthew Butler Koranda\n\nYes. Very helpful. And then maybe just one for Matteo. The fourth quarter, it looks like you made some adjustments or you provided sort of a hypothetical adjustment for what automotive revenues would have been without UAW strike and then the non-automotive electronics phaseout. Maybe just wanted you to provide a little bit more color on how you got between sort of the plus 5% to the 10% adjusted revenue growth in automotive. And then for the outlook, it does look like you guys are including some decent outperformance versus production, which would be a return to sort of the normal state for Gentherm. Can you just talk about how that phases through the year? Just curious about -- I think you had mentioned more launches towards the latter half of the year. So any sense you could give us for relative growth rate versus production in the first half versus the second would be great.\n\nMatteo Anversa\n\nSure. So maybe let me start with the first one. Actually, in the press release, we outlined a little bit with a table. You really have a couple of things happening. The impact of the strike in the quarter was about almost $9.5 million, which was clearly lower than what we had anticipated in the last earnings call. And then when we are re-adding back the non-automotive electronics revenue, which was about $2.7 million, and then we had about $3.5 million of one-time customer recoveries, meaning that we're not expecting those to repeat and then the foreign currency impact. So when you break it down, that's how you get to the reported number of growth to be about 10% that we outlined in the press release and the comments.\r\n\r\nOn the cadence, I think was your second question, we're expecting revenue for sure, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to be lower in the first quarter, and then we'll continue to grow progressively throughout the year. So it's difficult to project and pinpoint what the outgrow will be in every quarter. But overall, the reason why the second half revenue will be higher than the first half is primarily driven by timing of new launches, which are coming out in the later part of the year.\n\nMatthew Butler Koranda\n\nOkay. That makes sense. And then just last one for me and I'll turn it over. But the 2026 guidance change that you guys made looks like a change of about $250 million at the midpoint relative to your earlier guidance that you provided. I think the Battery Performance Solutions growth was supposed to be about $150 million of that. So just wanted to understand sort of where are we taking out incremental revenue. It sounded like you guys mentioned just a little more reticence on the part of OEMs on EV production. Any other items to call out in terms of the change there for 2026?\n\nPhillip M. Eyler\n\nSure, sure. Yes. I mean, clearly, the BPS, you called out the right number at the midpoint was $150 million growth of BPS. We're actually going to see a decline of BPS. So not just a loss of the growth, but actually a decline from now until that time period. So that's going to be the biggest driver of the reduction. And then we'll be, as you pointed out -- and we expect to see a delayed ramp-up of some of the EVs that we are targeted on just based on feedback from our customers and what we're seeing in the market expectations. The second -- the next factor is related to North America vehicle production in 2026. We're actually seeing a decline in a few of our large North America OEMs outlook for 2026 based on the S&P Global outlook, which kind of makes sense to us. So that's going to be a factor as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Glenn Chin with Seaport Research Partners.\n\nGlenn Edward Chin\n\nCongrats on all the wins and the win rate. Very encouraging. Just sort of following on Matt's line of questioning. There's been a lot of delays, deferrals in EV launches, production, et cetera. I assume that's already reflected in or there's nothing further to be reflected in the awards that you just booked the $900 million in this quarter. But is it possible to dimension, Phil, what sort of revisions might have to be made to prior bookings? Notwithstanding the fact that you're talking about it for 2026, but any way you could dimension for us, for example, what percent was EV related perhaps?\n\nPhillip M. Eyler\n\nWell, we don't -- it's tough for us to break down the percent EV in the awards because some of the awards -- in fact, many of the awards are cross platform. Just to give you an example, the BMW X Series win that I called out is on both the ICE and the EV. So that's more of a combined number. But I would say we -- to the best of our ability, we've built that into our plan for 2024 and then 2026 as well. I mean, we clearly still believe in EVs as a driver for future growth. As that becomes more clear in those out years beyond 2026, obviously we'll start to build that into our outlook.\n\nGlenn Edward Chin\n\nOkay. Very good. And then just a follow-up on the GM architecture question. Can you give us a sense of the timing there? When do these launch?\n\nPhillip M. Eyler\n\nIt will take a couple years before that new architecture goes in.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.\n\nRyan Ronald Sigdahl\n\nJust staying on GM and ClimateSense. Is that award -- or the architecture for ClimateSense, is that included in the Q4 awards? And then also, is that include -- any of that included in the 2026 targets, given it'll take a couple years?\n\nPhillip M. Eyler\n\nYes, it's included in both.\n\nRyan Ronald Sigdahl\n\nGot it. And then on content, you historically have talked about 2x to 4x higher content for ClimateSense. Is that a good rule of thumb for this award?\n\nPhillip M. Eyler\n\nI think it scales, given the fact that this software will orchestrate any level of climate seating and steering wheel. It could span all the way from, let's call it, an entry vehicle that has low content all the way up to the higher content. So we'll have to see how that plays out across their portfolio over time. But we definitely are seeing a movement towards higher content as we have ClimateSense control in a car.\n\nRyan Ronald Sigdahl\n\nGot it. And then just on the BPS cell connecting product. You guys launched a very large award with BMW just a few quarters ago there. I guess is the assumption that that sunsets after this platform?\n\nPhillip M. Eyler\n\nYes, it is.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with J.P. Morgan.\n\nRyan Joseph Brinkman\n\nJust another one on the recent win with GM. I understand your share of GM seat comfort business will rise. But is there something about this award that also makes you think that maybe the penetration of seat comfort products within GM could materially increase, either because the vehicles -- it's offered in more vehicles, more trim levels or maybe because it's designed right into the electrical architecture? Or maybe because the synergies and the economies of scale that both you and GM might realize by commonizing and expanding the offering could afford a lower price point to GM or hopefully the consumer helping to drive the penetration? Just trying to understand if this is more about increasing your share versus competitors of these products or maybe about driving the penetration of the products? Which would you say is the bigger opportunity?\n\nPhillip M. Eyler\n\nYes. I think it's probably some of all of those points. I think those are very astute points. But I think the biggest thing to kind of break it down, on EVs, we definitely expect to see a higher penetration rate and content on EVs. And certainly, that could apply to any kind of electrified vehicle, by the way, whether it's a full EV or a plug-in hybrid. And mainly because, obviously you get the comfort benefit, but you also get the range extension. And that remains a clear important feature for our customers. And then if you look at the ICEs, I mean we're really excited that ClimateSense is going to orchestrate climate seating in ICEs. And the reason is a very compelling value proposition for consumer comfort because it really becomes seamless. In essence, what you're doing is you're focusing on the passenger or driver relative comfort level at that microclimate location and not necessarily the entire cabin. And so this is really starting to pay off for us. So I think that's also going to help drive content and penetration on ICEs as well.\n\nRyan Joseph Brinkman\n\nOkay. I wanted to ask a couple of questions, too, around the pause of the BPS cell connecting, starting with I remember you highlighting some of the strengths of your product like it was lighter weight and more environmentally friendly than some of the competitor solutions, and there's thought to be this growing need for cell connecting and battery health monitoring. So maybe you could just help us understand what maybe changed there in the market. I wonder if maybe the solution was incorporated into more comprehensive battery management systems technologies that other suppliers were offering? Or what would you say changed there?\n\nPhillip M. Eyler\n\nWell, no, I don't think it has anything to do with the battery management system architecture. That I think is basically the same. To be frank with you, the fundamental shift that we're seeing is related to our competition, especially chemical etch competition. That space is loaded with capacity. And I believe personally that the level of accepted pricing because of that excess capacity is putting us in a very difficult position when it comes to pricing competition. And there's no doubt, our consumers have -- or our customers have confirmed to us that our product provides extremely beneficial sustainability benefits and technical benefits, which revolves around the material selection, and as you pointed out, the light weight. But frankly, the drive towards lower cost batteries is winning today, and that chem etches is kind of taking it there. So we're in a position that if that pipeline is not going to be in front of us in the near term, it makes more sense for us to defer our resources and investments and focus into the areas that are seeing accelerated growth, which is our climate and comfort products, thermal and pneumatic.\n\nRyan Joseph Brinkman\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Then the second question there also on the BPS is that product, the cell connecting was once thought to maybe pick up the slack left by an earlier product, which was the thermoelectric temperature regulation. Not of the big batteries, of course. You've got air cooling. But of these smaller batteries that might be applicable for 48-volt or micro-hybrid type vehicles, and that was with some European OEMs or maybe some luxury OEMs, and some of that was rolling off. And that was understood to be I think because 48-volt didn't really pan out like the industry once thought. But it just seems like in the very recent past here, just kind of in the fourth quarter, there's been some more scuttlebutt about it, including with the cyber truck having officially launched and Elon Musk saying on X that he was mailing to Jim Farley and Mary Barra a packet with all the technical details explaining why they need to double down as well, which will decrease the cost for everybody. And Jim Farley responded positively on Twitter to that saying that maybe they need to push again. And just curious if there's any potential for that market to come back to life? Or is there some other competitive dynamic going on there, too, where maybe the thermoelectric regulation isn't as attractive as was once thought? Or is it just the market's smaller? What are your thoughts for 48-volt is going and what you might potentially be able to provide there?\n\nPhillip M. Eyler\n\nYes, I'm not optimistic on the thermoelectric BPS product for 48-volt. And the primary reason is the architecture for 48-volt systems is a little different when you look at what you mentioned on EVs, especially. This is -- the 48-volt that in the past has been used has been really used as a drivetrain boost. And to do that, it required a lot of utilization of those batteries, creating a lot of heat. And that's where our cooling product really became pretty important. We do see some opportunities on 48-volt with air cooling. We are winning some business, and we called that out in the last couple of quarters with different customers. Hyundai Kia as an example, we're going to be cooling all of their 48-volt batteries using our air cooling devices. So there's some of that built into our outlook. Certainly, the 48-volt BASIS POINTS, thermoelectric BPS with Mercedes will gradually decline over time. It's not going to be a digital decline, but it will steadily decline. So if you net all that out -- and we do have some built-in wins with our MSP-based battery heating as well using the same technology as the CCB. But netting all that out, we're seeing a net decline in revenue of BPS through 2026.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Luke Junk with Baird.\n\nLuke L. Junk\n\nApologies for the background noise here. Phil, I was hoping we could start with the ClimateSense award with GM. And what I'm really hoping to tease out is just the software opportunity alone versus scaling in hardware over time. I really just want to better understand the materiality both of the software piece that you announced today and then the underlying compute to controller, understanding that you can add hardware to that overtime.\n\nPhillip M. Eyler\n\nYes. Yes, I mean I wouldn't call it a material revenue driver for us. It is very high margin. But it's more about what it enables than the specific driver of revenue growth for the software. It does open up more opportunity for us on ECUs. And we've called out I think 1 or 2 quarters ago the win on a multifunction ECU for General Motors. So that -- we think this helps us to drive content on our electronics as well. But we've specifically made our software really a software product that can be used on any hardware. Our goal is to find ways to get ClimateSense embedded to show the value that ClimateSense generates, thus driving much higher content and penetration. And we believe ClimateSense has the power to do that. So that's kind of what's behind it. I would look at this as really firming up our long-standing strategy of driving software-enabled hardware through our portfolio.\n\nLuke L. Junk\n\nOkay. That's really helpful. And then I appreciate you might not be able to give us too much here because it's pretty recent, but just curious, any feedback following CES on WellSense specifically? Just in terms of customer engagement, maybe any kind of preliminary engineering engagements or just other indicators and interest in that platform?\n\nPhillip M. Eyler\n\nI would say tremendous interest by our customers. It matches exactly what many of our customers have as their vision for differentiating their offerings. And I really want to highlight the impact this product could have on the software-defined vehicle architectures. We believe this provides a feature that consumers will continually pay for after the purchase of the vehicle. And I think if you look at a lot of the announced software-defined vehicle features that folks have talked about to help them drive revenue, you won't find any that are more compelling than the one we're offering. So I think it really is gaining a lot of traction. Obviously, it'll take us some time to gather some awards and build that in, but I'm really encouraged by the response.\n\nLuke L. Junk\n\nAnd then my last question probably for Matteo. Just hoping you could bridge the midpoint of the EBITDA range of 13% versus where 2023 shook out. I'm really hoping to unpack just the big buckets in terms of what you expect incrementally from Fit-for-Growth. You mentioned some supplier cost reductions in the back half of the year. And then just underlying leverage and productivity, how should we bucket those at a high level.\n\nMatteo Anversa\n\nSure, look. So volume is driving about 160 basis points of margin expansion. The Fit-for-Growth actions, primarily supplier cost reductions, value engineering, so taking costs that were out of our bill of material is driving about 130 basis points of margin expansion. Productivity at the factory growth is about 90 bps. So these are the positives. And then on the negative side, we have -- we're not expecting to have the same amount of price recoveries from the customers in 2024 as we did in 2023. Actually, the environment on that front is getting more and more challenging. So we are expecting a drag of about 160 basis points on price. And then wage inflation, we continue to see elevated labor inflation, particularly in Mexico and Eastern Europe. So it's about almost 100 basis points. And then the investment in the new plants that I mentioned earlier and the R&D to fulfill the awards that we won, it's another 50 basis points drag. So that's, at a high level, the walk for the year. Sure.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session and this concludes our call today. We thank you for your interest and participation.

If you want to skip our discussion on the auto industry, head over to 5 Best Car Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nFitch Ratings' 2024 outlook for the global auto manufacturing and supply sector is neutral. Fitch forecasts improved supply chains boosting global vehicle production, but overall sales are expected to be hindered due to less robust economic conditions, particularly in the US and China. Fitch predicts a 4% increase in global sales and production in 2024. Fitch also foresees slower economic growth and higher interest rates impacting overall vehicle demand in 2024. Despite this, the existence of pent-up demand resulting from years of industry underproduction is likely to bolster sales. The normalization of vehicle pricing and product mix is expected to attract customers who were previously priced out of the market. Vehicle production has been operating at or slightly above recessionary levels for nearly three years. While Fitch does not anticipate a sales decline, sales are expected to remain below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nS&P Global Mobilitypredicts 88.3 million new vehicle sales globally in 2024, anticipating a 2.8% year-over-year increase in global new light vehicle sales. The recovery in light vehicle output continues, driven by supply chain improvements and recovering demand, particularly from pent-up consumer demand. However, S&P Global Mobility expresses caution about the recovery's sustainability due to challenges such as elevated vehicle pricing, difficult credit and lending conditions, and consumer confidence fluctuations. The forecast takes into account factors like persistent interest rates, supply chain improvements, affordability issues, high vehicle prices, varying consumer confidence, concerns about energy prices and supply, auto lending risks, and challenges associated with ongoing electrification efforts. Colin Couchman, executive director of global light vehicle forecasting for S&P Global Mobility, commented:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"2024 is expected to be another year of cagey recovery, with the auto industry moving beyond clear supply-side risks, into a murkier macro-led demand environment. A major concern is how 'natural' EV demand will fare as governments consider scaling back interventionist policy support - especially for incentives and subsidies, industrial policy, and OEM planning targets.\"\n\nIn 2024, the automotive industry is experiencing shifts in trends. The electrification of vehicles, a dominant theme, faces a reality check as consumer adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in North America slows down, signaling a more extended journey for widespread acceptance. Meanwhile, autonomous technologies are advancing, with Level 3 conditional driving automation being adopted on certain vehicles. Chinese and Indian automakers are making strides in international markets like the EU, US, and Africa, challenging established brands like Toyota and Volkswagen. Economic uncertainties are influencing consumer spending, leading to increased demand for used cars and extended ownership of existing vehicles. The car-as-a service (CaaS) model is emerging as an alternative to traditional leasing, offering subscription-based programs with potential long-term commitments. Additionally, micro-mobility, represented by electric scooters, bicycles, and e-bikes, is gaining popularity as a cost-effective and convenient mode of transportation for short urban trips. These trends collectively signify a transformative period in the automotive industry.\n\nInvestors looking to put their money in the automotive sector can buy stocks like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe chose the top auto stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 33\n\nAsbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG) is an American automotive retailer that provides new and used vehicles, vehicle repair and maintenance services, replacement parts, and collision repair services. On February 8, Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $7.12, missing market consensus by $0.47. The revenue climbed 2.7% year-over-year to $3.8 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $100 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 33 hedge funds were bullish on Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG), compared to 30 funds in the prior quarter. David Abrams\u2019 Abrams Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.10 million shares worth $474.35 million.\n\nLike General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG) is one of the best auto stocks to monitor.\n\nBonhoeffer Capital Management stated the following regarding Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOur broadcast TV franchises, leasing, building products distributors and dealerships, plastic packaging, and roll-on roll-off (\u201cRORO\u201d) shipping fall into this category. One trend we find particularly compelling in these firms is growth creation through acquisitions, which provides synergies and operational leverage associated with vertical and horizontal consolidation. The increased cash flow from acquisitions and subsequent synergies are used to repay the debt and repurchase stock; and the process is repeated. This strategy\u2019s effectiveness is dependent upon a spread between borrowing interest rates and the cash returns from the core business and acquisitions. Over the past 12 months, interest rates have been increasing, which has reduced the economics of this strategy; but a large spread still exists if assets can be purchased at the right price. Increasing interest rates have affected the returns on public LBO firms. Some firms have been reducing debt to reduce the impact of higher rates on earnings.\n\nAsbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG), a US-based automobile dealer group, a portfolio holding, is an example of a private LBO. Given Asbury\u2019s current valuation of an 18% earnings yield and, more importantly, a five-year forward earnings yield of 38%, buybacks are accretive. Management has developed a long-term plan that includes acquisitions and operational leverage from internet sales and prepaid service plans. The net income annual growth is expected to be 25% over the next two years based upon management\u2019s plan. Holding the current modest 6 times multiple of earnings constant, the rate of earnings growth implies a 25% total return\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\n12. Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 33\n\nStellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) is a global company involved in the design, engineering, manufacturing, distribution, and sale of automobiles, light commercial vehicles, engines, transmission systems, metallurgical products, mobility services, and production systems. Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) is one of the best auto stocks to buy.\n\nOn February 15, Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) declared a \u20ac1.55 per share annual dividend, a 15.7% increase from its prior dividend of \u20ac1.34. The dividend is payable on May 3, to shareholders on record as of April 23. Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) also plans to implement a \u20ac3 billion open-market share buyback program in 2024.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 33 hedge funds were long Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA), compared to 27 funds in the prior quarter. Karthik Sarma\u2019s SRS Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 8.4 million shares worth $197.4 million.\n\nMiller Value Partners Income Strategy made the following comment about Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe initiated a starter position in Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA), which makes Jeep, Dodge and Fiat cars. The company has a nearly 8% dividend yield with enough net cash (cash minus debt) on the balance sheet to cover the dividend for almost five years. The company trades at 1.7x operating profits, which means the market is already expecting a likely drop in cash flow. Still, the shares appear to be worth meaningfully more than where they trade, and management is heavily aligned with stockholders with a 14% stake. They share our view that the valuation is compelling, as the company plans on repurchasing ~3% of shares outstanding this year.\u201d\n\n11. Gentex Corporation (NASDAQ:GNTX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 33\n\nGentex Corporation (NASDAQ:GNTX) specializes in designing, developing, manufacturing, and supplying digital vision, connected car, dimmable glass, and fire protection products globally. On January 26, Gentex Corporation (NASDAQ:GNTX) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $0.50 and a revenue of $589.1 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.05 and $26.93 million, respectively. Revenue for the quarter increased 19.3% compared to the same period last year. The revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 incorporated one-time cost recoveries of around $5 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 33 hedge funds were bullish on Gentex Corporation (NASDAQ:GNTX), compared to 32 funds in the prior quarter. John W. Rogers\u2019 Ariel Investments is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 6.5 million shares worth $214 million.\n\nHere is what Ariel Fund & Ariel Appreciation Fund has to say about Gentex Corporation\u00a0 in its Q3 2021 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we added leading supplier of automatic-dimming mirrors for the automotive industry, Gentex Corporation (GNTX), to Ariel Fund and Ariel Appreciation Fund. With over 90% market share and a long history of technological innovation and manufacturing capability, the company consistently outgrows the broader industry, produces best-in-class operating margins, and generates attractive free cash flows. Recently, the stock has underperformed due to broad-based supply chain concerns and the disruption of global automotive production. We view these worries as overblown and see this as an opportunity to own a high-quality, niche franchise with excellent and improving growth prospects, well-positioned to benefit from growing market adoption of its essential technologies.\u201d\n\n10. AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 34\n\nAutoNation, Inc.

(NYSE:AN), compared to 38 funds in the last quarter. Anand Parekh\u2019s Alyeska Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 604,684 shares worth $90.8 million.\n\nHere is what Bonhoeffer Capital Management has to say about AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAutoNation has followed an organic growth and buyback strategy versus a consolidation strategy. All of the firms have had a reduction in PE over the last 10 years. The question is: will these historical trends continue? There is a large TAM for continued consolidation, and given the PEs (6-8x earnings) today, buybacks will be accretive to all of these firms. I think the historical trends are intact and will continue into the future; thus, I am bullish on growth for the consolidation-focused automobile dealers.\u201d\n\n9. Lear Corporation (NYSE:LEA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 34\n\nLear Corporation (NYSE:LEA) is engaged in the design, development, engineering, manufacturing, and supply of automotive seating, electrical distribution systems, and related components for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the automotive industry.

Pzena\u2019s Pzena Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 6.25 million shares worth over $833 million.\n\nDiamond Hill Capital Mid Cap Strategy made the following comment about Lear Corporation (NYSE:LEA) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAs markets have risen, we have been cautious about deploying cash. That said, we are still finding attractive values in the market and capitalized on attractive entry points to initiate three new positions in Q2: Ferguson, SBA Communications Corp and Lear Corporation (NYSE:LEA).\n\nLear is a leading manufacturer of global automotive seating and is end-market agnostic to the ICE/EV (internal combustion engine to electric vehicles) secular shift. Lear has a stable business with attractive cash-generation capabilities. A recent market selloff allowed us to establish a market position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.\u201d\n\n8. Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 34\n\nFerrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) is a global luxury performance sports car manufacturer that engages in the design, engineering, production, and sale of various car models, including special series, limited edition supercars, and track cars. It is one of the best auto stocks to monitor. On February 1, Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of \u04041.62 and a revenue of \u04041.52 billion, up 10.9% on a year-over-year basis.

(NYSE:RACE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cFerrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) (+26.48%): The luxury automaker\u2019s long awaited Purosangue, their first four door, four seater vehicle, has proven so popular that the company announced that they have ceased accepting new orders as they are sold out through all of this year and into 2024. The Purosangue is designed not as a copycat sports utility vehicle that many other luxury automakers sell, but as a true Ferrari car that their devoted fan base can use for more practical transportation needs. Since the average Ferrari is only driven a few thousand miles a year or less, they are best understood as mechanical works of art rather than a means of transportation. But with the introduction of the Purosangue, Ferrari enthusiasts will have a vehicle that meets transportation needs, while still delivering the extremely high end experience that you would expect from a car that costs about $500,000.\u201d\n\n7. Autoliv, Inc. (NYSE:ALV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 35\n\nAutoliv, Inc.

        "content": "(Adds more details on EV tax credit, VW regaining credit last month in paragraphs 4-9)\n\nBy David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - General Motors said on Wednesday the automaker's Cadillac Lyriq is again eligible for a U.S. $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit after a battery sourcing change to address two minor components.\n\nNew U.S. Treasury battery sourcing rules took effect on Jan. 1 that cut by more than half the EVs eligible for tax credits. GM had offered $7,500 discounts to make up for the lost Lyriq credit.\n\nThe Chevy Blazer EV -- which is currently subject to a stop sale over a software issue -- also lost the credit. GM said last month it expects its Chevrolet Equinox EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV and Cadillac Optiq produced \"after the sourcing change will be eligible for the full incentive.\"\n\nGM sold 9,154 Lyriq vehicles last year in the United States.\n\nOn Jan. 24, Volkswagen said it had regained eligibility for its ID.4 EV electric vehicle for $7,500 tax credits.\n\nSUVs must be priced up to $80,000 and cars $55,000 to be eligible for EV tax credits.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Treasury said it has reimbursed auto dealers for about $135 million in advance point-of-sale consumer electric vehicle tax credit payments since the start of the year through Feb. 6.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service has received more than 25,000 time of sale reports, including more than 19,500 - or 78% - with advance payment requests and approximately $135 million has been paid to dealers since Jan. 1, Treasury said.\n\nConsumers must attest they meet income limits to qualify for the tax credit at time of purchase or they will need to repay the government when filing their taxes. For new vehicles, the adjusted gross income limit is $300,000 for married couples and $150,000 for individuals. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jonathan Oatis)",

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Believe General Motors Company (GM) Could Rally 27.07%: Here's is How to Trade",
        "content": "General Motors Company (GM) closed the last trading session at $39.01, gaining 10.7% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $49.57 indicates a 27.1% upside potential.\n\nThe average comprises 20 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $28 to a high of $95, with a standard deviation of $17.84. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 28.2% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 143.5% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.\n\nWhile the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.\n\nBut, for GM, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.\n\nHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price Targets\n\nAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.\n\nWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?\n\nStory continues\n\nThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.\n\nHowever, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.\n\nThat said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.\n\nHere's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in GM\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 16.3%, as eight estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revision.\n\nMoreover, GM currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much GM could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors alike.\n\nWhile you may have an investing style you rely on, finding great stocks is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores. These are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on value, growth, and/or momentum characteristics.\n\nWhy Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value Stock\n\nDifferent than growth or momentum investors, value-focused investors are all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under what their true value is before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (GM)\n\nOne of the world\u2019s largest automakers, General Motors held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16.2% in 2023. Headquartered in Detroit, the auto giant has had a long and checkered history. Founded in 1908, the company rose to dominate the U.S. industry. However, hit by the financial crisis, General Motors filed for bankruptcy on Jun 1, 2009. Just within 40 days, the firm emerged from bankruptcy. In 2010, the company launched its IPO \u2013 the biggest in U.S. history at that time \u2013 and has been steadily profitable since then. From going bankrupt in 2009 to becoming one of the world\u2019s best-run car companies, General Motors has indeed come a long way.\n\nGM sits at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), holds a Value Style Score of A, and has a VGM Score of B. Compared to the Automotive - Domestic industry's P/E of 13.3X, shares of General Motors Company are trading at a forward P/E of 4.3X. GM also has a PEG Ratio of 0.5, a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 2X, and a Price/Sales ratio of 0.3X.\n\nA company's earnings performance is important for value investors as well. For fiscal 2024, eight analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for GM, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $1.31 to $9.00 per share. GM also holds an average earnings surprise of 20%.\n\nStory continues\n\nGM should be on investors' short lists because of its impressive earnings and valuation fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and strong Value and VGM Style Scores.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why General Motors Company (GM) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "General Motors Company (GM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this company have returned +10.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which General Motors Company belongs, has lost 4.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nGeneral Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $2 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7.2%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9 points to a change of +17.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +16.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.25 indicates a change of +2.8% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +22.5%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors Company is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $40.46 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $174.98 billion and $176.79 billion estimates indicate +1.8% and +1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $42.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $2.12 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.78 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.4%. The EPS surprise was +10.71%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGeneral Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why Fast-paced Mover General Motors Company (GM) Is a Great Choice for Value Investors",
        "content": "Momentum investing is essentially the opposite of the tried-and-tested Wall Street adage -- \"buy low and sell high.\" Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by \"buying high and selling higher.\"\n\nEveryone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.\n\nA safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (GM) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:\n\nInvestors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 10.7% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this company well in this regard.\n\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. GM meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 35% over the past 12 weeks.\n\nMoreover, the momentum for GM is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.49. This indicates that the stock moves 49% higher than the market in either direction.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that GM has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.\n\nIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped GM earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nMost importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, GM is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. GM is currently trading at 0.26 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 26 cents for each dollar of sales.\n\nSo, GM appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.\n\nIn addition to GM, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.\n\nThis is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

        "title": "12 Happiest Jobs In The World in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 12 happiest jobs in the world in 2024. We have also discussed companies with a great work-life balance that ensure happy jobs. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Happiest Jobs In The World in 2024.\n\nThe world\u2019s happiest jobs are those that intertwine meaning, purpose, passion, and empathy. Roles where individuals feel their work directly contributes to improving lives or society tend to yield the greatest satisfaction. However, jobs with the highest satisfaction are rare and are in fact, often elusive given the demands of modern work life. Healthcare jobs are often considered jobs that make you happy and rich.\n\nDespite the belief that meaning and purpose guarantee happiness, professions like nursing demonstrate otherwise. Even with their profound impact and compassionate care, nurses today are burnt out, longing for respite and inner peace. To read more about why nurses are burnt out, see countries that need nurses the most.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that an 85-year Harvard study reveals that the unhappiest jobs in the world are often the loneliest, confirming the vital role of positive relationships in work satisfaction and overall happiness. Roles with limited human interaction and minimal opportunities for meaningful connections among coworkers tend to breed misery. This is because loneliness pervades industries like truck driving and night security, where independence outweighs interpersonal relations, as well as emergent tech sectors like online retail. Workplace loneliness not only affects job satisfaction but also poses health risks comparable to smoking and obesity.\n\nThere is a growing desire for better work-life balance, increased flexibility, equity in the workplace, and opportunities for skill development. Hence, modern employees, especially younger generations like Gen Z and millennials, may also harbor reservations about managerial responsibilities due to a lack of trust in senior leadership, concerns about work-related stress, and doubts about the value of extra compensation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Randstad's Workmonitor 2024 report, nearly 40% of workers prefer their current roles over promotions. Released on January 18, 2024, the report surveyed 27,000 individuals across 34 markets, revealing that 34% are uninterested in managerial positions. This also falls in line with the contemporary career trends favoring personal fulfillment over traditional advancement. Thus, employers are urged to redefine career progression, acknowledging individual aspirations while balancing professional and personal life to attract and retain talent in an evolving job market.\n\nAltria Group, Inc (NYSE:MO) and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) are two of the best companies with a work-life balance.\n\nAltria Group, Inc (NYSE:MO) prioritizes employee well-being with a plethora of benefits apart from their competitive salaries and an attractive incentive program, ensuring that its workforce feels valued. Notably, the company's Richmond base offers a favorable cost of living to enhance financial stability for employees. Moreover, Altria Group, Inc (NYSE:MO)\u2019s dedication to work-life balance is evident in its comprehensive benefits packages, covering essential healthcare needs like preventive care, dental, and vision \u2014 with dental coverage of up to $2,000 annually and orthodontia coverage at 50%, up to a $2,500 lifetime maximum. Additionally, the company provides great disability plans, including a Company-paid Short-Term Disability Plan for up to 26 weeks at full pay.\n\nAltria Group, Inc (NYSE:MO)\u2019s dedication to employees extends beyond physical health, as it offers resources like access to personal Health Advocates for navigating the healthcare system effectively. Recognized as a Great Place to Work-Certified company, Altria Altria Group, Inc (NYSE:MO) an impressive 88% employee satisfaction rate, highlighting its success in creating a supportive and fulfilling work environment that promotes both professional growth and personal well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) prioritizes employee well-being through a comprehensive approach aimed at promoting an excellent work-life balance. Firstly, the company's Life Event Services (LES) has supported teammates through more than 140,000 major life events, such as terminal illness, domestic violence, retirement, and medical accommodations. Moreover, the Sabbatical Program provides eligible employees with 4-6 weeks of additional paid time off every five years, promoting work-life balance and personal rejuvenation.\n\nIn terms of physical wellness, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) provides comprehensive health, insurance, and wellness benefits to nearly 400,000 individuals. Notably, medical premiums have remained stable since 2012 for teammates earning less than $50,000, and teammates are incentivized with a $500 credit toward their annual medical plan premium for completing wellness activities.\n\nEmotional wellness is another area of focus where Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) offers extensive support programs and benefits. This includes 26 weeks of parental leave, stress management training for managers, and unlimited, confidential counseling services available 24/7. By prioritizing emotional well-being, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) creates a supportive environment where employees feel valued and empowered to navigate life's challenges effectively. 30 Countries with Best Work-Life Balance in the World\n\nA happy customer inspecting a newly purchased used car with the help of a sales assistant.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the happiest jobs in the world in 2024, we shortlisted jobs with three major characteristics.

        "title": "It's 'hard to see' a catalyst for buying auto stocks, even Tesla, Gabelli fund manager says",
        "content": "For value investors, buying auto stocks has brought more pain than profit. But there are pockets of opportunity in the sector, to say the least.\n\n\u201cWe are value investors, and while the automakers are statistically inexpensive, investors face prospects for considerable CAPEX, reduced margins, and an uncertain outcome as it relates to electric vehicle market share,\u201d Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Brian Sponheimer told Yahoo Finance. Sponheimer is focused on the autos and industrials sectors at Gabelli, which is headed by billionaire investor Mario Gabelli.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be a time to buy automaker stocks such as Ford, GM, and Stellantis; it's just that at the moment, Sponheimer said, they're just too expensive. Signs are displayed at an AutoNation Chevrolet car dealership on April 21, 2022 in Valencia, Calif. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) (Mario Tama via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cGM [trading] at five times earnings or forward [price to earnings ratio] at six times earnings is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201c[If] the shares are going to take a 20% dip, then that might change just from a trading perspective, but we are really looking for a catalyst in stocks and it's hard to see that right now for the traditional automakers.\u201d\n\nTesla is at the other end of the valuation spectrum. Trading at 200 times earnings or thereabouts, it isn\u2019t the kind of stock that Gabelli\u2019s portfolio managers are going to target, but it could be. For investors, Sponheimer says it needs to have a investable thesis and perhaps a leap of faith.\n\n\u201cTesla certainly become more interesting at these levels than it has been in some time,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think that for a company that is going to be the leader in electric vehicle development over the course of the next decade, there are some really exciting things going on, but I can't definitively say that there's a price that I'm loving diving into, unless I really believe that there is an AI story here that I wanna invest in.\u201d\n\nTraditional automakers and Tesla aside, Sponheimer and Gabelli prefer ancillary trades in the auto space. Areas with more predictable resiliency like car dealership operators are an opportunity, he said, whereas companies like AutoNation (AN) can potentially benefit from increased vehicle complexity to drive parts and service sales.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAutoNation, which still sells through traditional dealerships new vehicles and used, is really taking advantage of what is the profit center of that dealership, to really grow that parts and service business, drive free cash flow, expand the business, and ultimately buy back quite a bit of its own stock in the process,\u201d Sponheimer says.\n\nLooking deeper into the small-cap value trade, slowing EV adoption means opportunity for gas-powered technology providers. New turbocharger technology is in favor across industrial and other various end markets, Sponheimer said, and companies like Garrett Motion (GTX) are poised to prosper.\n\nSponheimer said Garrett, well known among auto enthusiasts for its bolt-on turbochargers, is an \u201cinexpensive stock\u201d given the current environment with \u201cterrific cash flow.\u201d\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

We are making progress.\"\n\nBarra said at a conference last week the Detroit automaker has \"already revamped the software development process and more importantly the validation process....

        "content": "Michael Burry is an investing legend and one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest bears. The investor is best known for betting against the U.S. housing market during the subprime mortgage meltdown that led to the 2008/09 financial crisis, an event chronicled in the book and film \u201cThe Big Short.\u201d\n\nHowever, while Burry continues to issue warning about the market on social media, he apparently turned bullish on equities in the fourth quarter of 2023. According to the latest regulatory filing of Burry\u2019s investment firm, Scion Asset Management, the investor boosted his portfolio from 13 stock positions to 25, more than doubling its value to $95 million in the process. The increased buying surprised many people as Burry had issued several grim forecasts for the stock market throughout last year, and placed options bets against both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices last summer. But now, with both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 at all-time highs, Burry seems to have changed his tune.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBurry bought 30,000 shares of e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the final quarter of 2023, a stake worth right around $5 million based on the current share price. This appears to be a smart move by Burry, who got in on AMZN stock just before the company reported a strong print for Q4 2023, sending its stock up sharply as a result. So far this year, AMZN stock is up 13% and Burry likely captured all of that gain. Since the end of October last year, Amazon\u2019s share price has increased 42%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAfter struggling for the better part of two years, Amazon\u2019s latest earnings showed the company is back on track. For the final three months of 2023, Amazon reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1 compared to 80 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $170 billion versus $166.20 billion that was forecast. Sales were up 14% from a year ago due to strong holiday shopping. Amazon\u2019s profit was up 3,233% from only 3 cents a year earlier. Burry looks to have gotten into AMZN stock at just the right time.\n\nStory continues\n\nOracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother new tech holding of Burry\u2019s firm Scion Asset Management is Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Burry purchased 50,000 shares of ORCL stock, which is now worth $5.5 million based on the current share price. The investing legend looks to have taken a shine to the third-largest software company in the world by revenue despite its stock sinking at the end of last year. In mid-December, Oracle\u2019s share price fell 12% after the company reported revenue that missed Wall Street forecasts.\n\nDespite the earnings disappointment, Oracle announced some exciting developments along with its latest print. These include revenue in its cloud infrastructure unit rising 52% year-over-year to $1.60 billion. Clients include Elon Musk\u2019s new start-up company xAI. Oracle also picked up cloud business from rival Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and bought privately held Australian company Next Technik, which makes field service software, for an undisclosed amount of money.\n\nIt\u2019s not known exactly when Burry bought ORCL stock in Q4 of last year, or if he took advantage of the post-earnings dip. But either way, this investment looks smart as Oracle\u2019s share price has increased 7% so far in 2024. In the past 12 months, the stock has gained 30%.\n\nStellantis (STLA) Stellantis (STLA) logo at the transmission factory.

The European-based company and parent of Chrysler saw its stock perform well in 2023, rising 64% on the year and outpacing rivals such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F). However, Burry looks to have exited his position in STLA stock and taken profits just as the automaker was in the thick of rotating strikes by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union last autumn.\n\nThe move to get rid of STLA stock looks smart as the company reported that the UAW strike cost it $3.2 billion in October of last year. The expensive new labor agreement reached with the UAW to end the work stoppage at its U.S. plants is likely to weigh on Stellantis\u2019 earnings going forward, making it a smart move to sell the stock when Burry did. While STLA stock has continued to rally this year and is up another 11% since the start of January, Burry likely hedged his bets and took profits while he could.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in MSFT.

        "title": "TSLA Stock Analysis: Is Tesla\u2019s Astronomical Valuation a House of Cards?",
        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains the world\u2019s most valuable car company. Despite the stock being down almost 20% so far this year, it entered trade on February 19 with a market cap of $637 billion. This is the starting point for my TSLA stock analysis.\n\nThat\u2019s more than twice the value of Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), which sits in second at $306 billion. The second most valuable U.S. car company, Ford Motor (NYSE:F), is worth $55 billion.\n\nBut how big is Tesla, really? Tesla sales last year came to $96 billion. Toyota had $247 billion. Ford had $176 billion. Tesla saw nearly $15 billion in net income, but Toyota had over $16 billion. (Ford had just $4 billion.)\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe question for today is, without Elon Musk, would Tesla still be worth a premium?\n\nTesla Strengths\n\nTesla earned its advantage over Toyota, and the rest of the industry, by building out the infrastructure for EV production and making it profitable.\n\nBut profitability is stalling. Auto revenue was no better in the fourth quarter, at $21 billion, than the year before. Services, including charges for the software running in Tesla cars, saved the quarter, adding 10% to total revenue.\n\nThis is the argument Tesla fans have always made, that it\u2019s less a product company like Toyota and more a services business like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Services at Apple represent just 19% of revenue.\n\nTesla fans also love its battery business, which was worth $6 billion last year. Tesla has a huge battery plant in Nevada, but the Inflation Reduction Act means competitors are building their own plants. Tesla is also assembling batteries made by Chinese giant CATL, which is building a plant in Michigan for Ford. CATL is worth an estimated $100 billion.\n\nIt seems Tesla\u2019s strengths are weakening.\n\nTesla Weaknesses\n\nTesla\u2019s weaknesses are also strengthening.\n\nThe biggest weakness is its product line, which needs a complete refresh. The cars all look like Toyota\u2019s Camry. The Camry will soon be hybrid-only, a power system American buyers prefer because the gas engine eliminates range anxiety.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is where the market battle will be fought, with Toyota believing full electrics will never get more than 30% of the global market, due to lagging infrastructure.\n\nFord and General Motors (NYSE:GM) agree with Toyota. Today\u2019s batteries are too heavy for the huge pick-ups on which American companies make their money. This is a key part of my TSLA stock analysis.\n\nToyota is the big threat, which is why its stock is up 59% over the last year, against a 4% loss for Tesla. Tesla\u2019s supply chain is all-electric. The value of Toyota\u2019s $198 billion in property, against Tesla\u2019s $60 billion, might be discounted. By how much?\n\nThen there\u2019s the Tesla Cybertruck, which looks like a giant failure.  Meanwhile, Toyota is rolling out an electric version of its Tacoma truck, Ford and GM are building hybrids, and sales of the Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) electric are slowing.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI can see why Tesla is still the most valuable American car company. But 13 times more? I can also see why Tesla would be worth what Toyota is. But twice as much?\n\nThe difference between Toyota\u2019s valuation and Tesla\u2019s is Elon Musk. Musk isn\u2019t worth $330 billion to me.\n\nToyota will be facing the same competitors two years from now that it\u2019s facing today. Tesla, with its all-electric line-up, will also be facing BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) and a host of other Chinese names.\n\nThe name of the EV game in 2025 will be producing a $25,000 car. That\u2019s a price a middle-income family can afford. That\u2019s what I paid for my current car. Toyota meets it, with its hybrids. BYD will meet it, with electrics.\n\nTesla won\u2019t meet it. Sell it. This concludes my TSLA stock analysis.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in AAPL.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

        "title": "3 Lithium Stocks to Turn $100,000 Into $1 Million: February 2024",
        "content": "There has been a significant correction in lithium prices in the last few quarters. This has translated into a deep correction for some of the best lithium stocks.\n\nI am of the view that this correction is a once in a lifetime opportunity to accumulate lithium names for the long term. There will be a few 10-baggers from the industry before the end of the decade.\n\nAn important point to note is that with the correction in lithium, big companies have already reduced their capital investment targets. There are analysts who believe that a global lithium shortage is likely as soon as 2025.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurther, a Boston Consulting Group report suggests that a lithium shortage is likely to be acute by 2035. By that year, the supply-gap is estimated at 1.1 million metric tons. Clearly, the long-term outlook for lithium is positive. Rewards will be multi-fold for investors willing to buy and hold lithium stocks with patience.\n\nWith this overview, let\u2019s talk about three lithium stocks to buy for 10-bagger returns.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) Person holding smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is among the massively undervalued lithium stocks that can be a 10-bagger in the next five years. The company\u2019s Thacker Pass project in north Nevada is a potential game-changer in terms of revenue and cash flows.\n\nThacker Pass feasibility study shows total production potential of 80,000tpa of lithium carbonate equivalent. With a mine life of 40-years and an IRR of 21.4%, the asset will create immense value.\n\nTo put things into perspective, the company is expecting an average annual EBITDA of $1.1 billion through the life of the asset. Further, the after-tax net present value of the asset is $5.7 billion. Comparing these numbers to the current market valuation of $740 million shows just how undervalued this stock is.\n\nOf course, there is a significant financing requirement with phase one capital cost of $2.3 billion. I however don\u2019t see it as a concern with General Motors (NYSE:GM) already committed to invest $650 million in two tranches. GM also has an offtake agreement for 100% of phase one production for 10-years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) stock has corrected by almost 60% in the last 12 months. The reason is a big plunge in lithium prices. I, however, believe that ALB stock will bottom out around current levels. Investors can consider gradual accumulation with an investment horizon of five years.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that for 2023, Albemarle reported 31% year-on-year revenue growth to $9.6 billion. However, with lower lithium price, adjusted EBITDA declined by 20% to $2.8 billion.\n\nAn important point to note is that between 2022 and 2027, Albemarle continues to guide for volumetric growth at a CAGR of 20%. Once lithium prices start trending higher, Albemarle will have the potential to deliver stellar cash flow growth.\n\nI don\u2019t see any credit stress with Albemarle ending last year with a liquidity buffer of $1.8 billion. The company has also announced capital expenditure reduction and cost control. These measures are likely to unlock more than $750 million in cash flows in the near term.\n\nStandard Lithium (SLI) Standard Lithium logo or icon on website page, Illustrative Editorial\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nStandard Lithium (NYSE:SLI) stock has also witnessed a massive sell-off in the last 12 months. The company currently trades at a market valuation of $226 million.\n\nHowever, considering the asset potential and if lithium trends higher, SLI stock can deliver 10x or 20x returns in the next five years.\n\nIn terms of assets, the company\u2019s South West Arkansas project has an after-tax net present value of $4.5 billion. Further, the Lanxess project has a NPV of $722 million. SLI is grossly undervalued when we compare it to the market valuation.\n\nBesides the plunge in lithium prices, there is another reason for the valuation gap. Standard Lithium needs to find the right partners for financing the project construction. Once that happens, I expect SLI stock to skyrocket.\n\nThe company has selected Ausenco Engineering Canada for Definitive Feasibility Study and Front-End Engineering and Design services for the South West Arkansas project. While production is still a few years away, Standard Lithium seems to be moving in the right direction.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

In turn, this will enhance its current capabilities. And, it will improve the energy density of its batteries to 1,000 watts per liter. At the heart of this growth strategy is the construction of a new $4 billion lithium-ion battery plant in Kansas. It will showcase Panasonic\u2019s commitment to improving battery efficiency and sustainability.\n\nAdditionally, Panasonic\u2019s sales forecast for the next quarter shines at $14.11 billion, consistently outperforming its industry. By diversifying its partnerships, including the recent collaboration with Lucid, Panasonic adds further to its prowess in the niche. Also, this strategic move underscores Panasonic\u2019s commitment to innovation and its dedication to powering a sustainable automotive future.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB), being a global titan in lithium production, is at the forefront of the high-demand battery market, especially for EVs.\n\nThis fully integrated operation demonstrates a significant footprint in the global market. Beyond lithium, Albemarle excels as a major player in bromine and oil refining catalysts. And, TipRanks analysts project a 16.31% price jump to an average target of $142.6. Therefore, confidence in its growth trajectory is evident.\n\nMoreover, the company\u2019s recent fourth-quarter financials report shows a jaw-dropping net sales surge to $2.4 billion. The jump is primarily driven by a 35% upswing in energy storage volume despite a net loss from specific charges. Additionally, strategic measures are set to unlock over $750 million in cash flow. Further, the completion of the Meishan lithium plant marks a milestone towards resilience and innovation.\n\nAlbemarle\u2019s positive 2024 outlook and workplace diversity and responsibility recognition highlight its commitment to sustainable growth and operational excellence.\n\nHoneywell International (HON) Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoneywell International (NASDAQ:HON) stands as a cornerstone in the battery stock landscape.

        "content": "(Adds GM comment, more details, additional comments on other potential awards)\n\nBy Doina Chiacu and David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. government is awarding $1.5 billion to GlobalFoundries to subsidize semiconductor production, the first major award from a $39 billion fund approved by Congress in 2022 to bolster domestic chip production.\n\nGlobalFoundries, the world's third-largest contract chipmaker, will build a new semiconductor production facility in Malta, New York, and expand existing operations there and in Burlington, Vermont, according to a preliminary agreement with the Commerce Department.\n\nThe department in January announced\n\na $162 million planned award to Microchip Technology\n\nand $35 million to\n\na BAE Systems facility\n\nin New Hampshire in December.\n\nThe $1.5 billion GlobalFoundries grant will be accompanied by $1.6 billion in available loans, with the funding expected to generate $12.5 billion in overall potential investment across the two states, the department said.\n\n\"The chips that GlobalFoundries will make in these new facilities are essential chips to our national security,\" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters Sunday.\n\nRaimondo told Reuters this month the agency is in active talks with numerous applicants and expects to make several announcements by the end of March.\n\n\"We're in the process of really complicated, challenging negotiations with these companies,\" Raimondo told Reuters. \"These are highly complex, first-of-their-kind facilities. The kind of facilities that TSMC, Samsung, Intel, are proposing to do in the United States -- these are new-generation investments -- size, scale complexity that's never been done before in this country.\"\n\nThe GlobalFoundries chips are used in satellite and space communications and the defense industry along with blind spot detection and collision warnings in vehicles, along with Wi-Fi and cellular connections.\n\n\"As an industry, we now need to turn our attention to increasing the demand for U.S.-made chips, and to growing our talented U.S. semiconductor workforce,\" GlobalFoundries CEO Thomas Caulfield said in a statement.\n\nStory continues\n\nGlobalFoundries opened a $4 billion semiconductor fabrication plant in Singapore in September, as part of a major global manufacturing expansion.\n\nThe Malta facility expansion will secure a stable supply of chips for auto suppliers and manufacturers, including General Motors, Raimondo added.\n\nGlobalFoundries and GM on Feb. 9 announced a long-term deal for the automaker to secure U.S.-made processors that will help it avoid factory-halting chip shortages like ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"GlobalFoundries\u2019 investment in New York both ensures a robust supply of semiconductors in the U.S. to help GM meet demand and supports U.S. leadership in automotive innovation,\" said General Motors President Mark Reuss.\n\nThe new facility in Malta will produce high-value chips that are not currently made anywhere in the United States, Raimondo added.

        "content": "Looking at General Motors Company's (NYSE:GM ) insider transactions over the last year, we can see that insiders were net buyers. That is, there were more number of shares purchased by insiders than there were sold.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for General Motors\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At General Motors\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Executive VP & CFO Paul Jacobson bought US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$32.60 per share. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of US$38.70. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price, this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price.\n\nYou can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! insider-trading-volume\n\nGeneral Motors is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this freelist of growing companies with insider buying.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that General Motors insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$116m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At General Motors Tell Us?\n\nThere haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, General Motors insiders feel good about the company's future. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To assist with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of General Motors.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "It's suddenly a great time to buy an EV",
        "content": "From legacy automakers to electric vehicle upstarts, the slump in EV demand is a rusty nail in the rear quarter panel. Headwinds such as elevated prices compared to gas vehicles, higher financing costs, and lack of charging infrastructure among other issues have put a lid on EV growth in the US.\n\nBut on the flip side, it\u2019s an extremely advantageous time for consumers looking to buy or lease an EV.\n\nJust this week, Kelley Blue Book found that year over year, new EV prices slipped 10.8% in January, and in December EV transaction prices fell to $53,611, the lowest in 12 months.\n\nOnline car shopping site CarGurus found that compared to last year, the number of days EVs are on the market increased while the number of days for ICE (internal combustion engine) autos decreased. And the average list price on the platform for a new EV in January was down 9.1% year over year, to around $60,000.\n\nThe used car market is even more extreme. CarGurus found the average list price of a used EV in January was a around $38.7K, down 20.6%.\n\nBut what this all means is it's a great time to shop for EVs before the market normalizes and prices head back up. Here are some of the best deals we found for new EVs, using incentives found in the New York City metro area and not including destination charges, which vary by manufacturer and vehicle.\n\nThe affordable crossover/hatchback: Hyundai IONIQ 5\n\nStarting price: $41,800 Deals: $7,500 off, 0.99% financing for 48 months A view of the Hyundai's electric IONIQ 5 model car during the introductory event in Istanbul, Turkiye on Sept. 16, 2022. (Serhat Cagdas/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) (Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nThe Hyundai IONIQ 5 is well reviewed, and in my opinion captures the retro-futuristic look perfectly. The car, which has the general footprint of a Golf GTI, offers a decent amount of space, a hatchback cargo area for added utility, and a comfortable and stylish interior.\n\nOne drawback is that the car isn\u2019t eligible for the federal EV tax credit, but here's where Hyundai steps in with its own $7,500 discount cash offer. This drops the price to $34,300, though this deal only lasts until the end of February. Hyundai is also offering attractive financing options, with 0.99% APR for 48 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe all-rounder: Tesla Model Y\n\nStarting price: $42,990 Deals: $1,000 discount till March 1, lease offers The Tesla Model Y. (Tesla) (Tesla)\n\nThere\u2019s a reason you see so many Model Ys around town. It\u2019s a quick crossover-type vehicle with an optional third row. With a spartan, tech-focused interior, quick steering, and a firm ride, the Model Y offers a unique driving dynamic. It also offers a suite of mobile connectivity features and the best and easiest-to-use charging network. The Model Y was the best-selling vehicle globally last year, and it\u2019s not hard to see why.\n\nRegardless of what you think of CEO Elon Musk and his various antics, the Model Y does stick out as a great option in the very crowded mid-size EV SUV class. The starting price has come down tremendously over the past year and Tesla has cut the price of the Model Y again by $1,000 this month.\n\nFull-size and grown up: Kia EV9\n\nStarting price: $54,900 Deals: $3,750 off, 3.25% financing for 48 months Kia's EV9 GT-line vehicle is unveiled during media day at the Seoul Mobility Show in Goyang, South Korea, Thursday, March 30, 2023. (Lee Jin-man/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nHyundai\u2019s sister brand Kia blew open the doors of the industry when it revealed a full-size, three-row EV SUV with decent range (270 miles, up to 304) and a relatively affordable starting price. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the EV9 looks like the electric spiritual successor to Toyota\u2019s iconic Land Cruiser SUV.\n\nJust like the IONIQ 5, Kia\u2019s EV9 doesn\u2019t qualify for federal EV tax credits. In this case, Kia is offering a half-credit, if you will, of $3,750 off, as well as 3.2% financing for 48 months. The cash-back offer expires on March 4 and customers must take delivery by then.\n\nLuxury unleashed: Lucid Air Pure\n\nStarting price: $67,400 (new price) Deals: $7,500 price cut (included above), lease offers A Lucid Air Grand Touring electric luxury car is displayed at the Lucid Motors Inc. studio and service center on Feb. 25, 2021, in Beverly Hills, Calif. (PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) (PATRICK T. FALLON via Getty Images)\n\nThe Lucid Air looks like an alien vehicle and performs likes it's from another galaxy as well. Featuring extreme straight-line speed with power that comes on smoothly and progressively and its compliant chassis, you can tell Lucid took its time dialing in the setup to get that proper mix of luxury and sport. I reviewed it in Grand Touring trim last year, and it was my favorite EV of the year.\n\nBut Lucid cars are expensive, and demand for high-priced EVs has fallen tremendously after early adopters purchased their Air sedans. Lucid has once again cut prices, with its entry level Air Pure RWD now starting at $67,400 following a new $7,500 price cut.\n\nNote that the Lucid doesn\u2019t qualify for EV tax credits due to a high starting price, though that federal tax cut can be passed down through the consumer via lease arrangement. Lucid says it's offering lease specials as low as $699 a month for 36 months, though there are up-front payments.\n\nRelated: Don't want a Tesla?

        "content": "EV stocks have been struggling thanks in large part to high interest rates.\n\nLook at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), for example. Since the year began, the EV giant sank from about $265 to a low of $175, all after\u00a0warning that growth would be notably lower than in 2023, when sales were up 39%. CEO Elon Musk even said that Chinese rivals \u201cwill pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world\u201d unless trade barriers are put in place,\u201d as noted by the BBC.\n\nWe\u2019ve even seen a scale-back of EV models from\u00a0General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F) because the demand just isn\u2019t there. However, while Tesla is struggling, there are other EV stocks you may not want to ignore at the moment. That includes:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto logo and store in downtown Lujiazui. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer. Business and finance concept photo.\n\nSource: Andy Feng / Shutterstock.com\n\nRebounding well off recent lows,\u00a0Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) could be one of the top EV stocks of the year. Just in January, the company delivered 31,165 EVs, which is a 105.8% improvement year over year. Cumulative deliveries of LI vehicles are also up to 664,529 at the close of January, with a good deal of upside remaining.\n\nXiang Li, chairman and chief executive officer of Li Auto said, \u201c2024 will be an\u00a0unprecedented year of growth for us, and we will establish a portfolio of eight competitive models, including four EREVs and four BEVs, to satisfy the evolving demands of our family users. Our 2024 launches will kick off in March with the official release and commencement of deliveries of our high-tech flagship family MPV, Li MEGA, alongside the rollout of the 2024 Li L7, Li L8, and Li L9,\u201d as noted in a company press release.\n\nWe\u2019ll learn more about Li\u2019s progress when the company posts financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 before the U.S. market opens on Monday, Feb. 26.\n\nXPeng (XPEV) XPeng (XPEV) car logo in Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition\n\nSource: THINK A / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can also look at\u00a0XPeng (NYSE:XPEV), whose January 2024 Smart EV sales soared 58%\u00a0to 8,250. The company also launched its X9 Ultra Smart Large Seven-seater MPV, delivering 2,478 units across 100+ Chinese cities. Better, the X9 Max is already dominating with 70% of all orders.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn December, the company delivered 20,115 EVs, a 78% jump year over year. For the fourth quarter of 2023, it delivered 60,158 vehicles\u2014a 171% year-over-year jump. For all of last year, it delivered 141,601 vehicles, a year-over-year improvement of 17%.\n\nThe company expects to expand in three new markets across Europe this year.\u00a0As noted by Electrek.co, \u201cXPeng is planning to expand to markets in Germany, France and Britain in 2024. Those entries will begin with the aforementioned G9 SUV and P7 sedan, as well as the automaker\u2019s most recent model to reach production, the G6.\u201d\n\nBYD (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor the second consecutive year, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) overtook Tesla as the world\u2019s top selling electric automaker. Helping, the company sold about 3.02 million EVs in 2023, an improvement of about 62% year over year.\n\nAccording to CNBC,\u00a0\u201cThe sales comprise 1.6M battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and approximately 1.4M plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The\u00a0company sold 526,409 fully electric vehicles in Q4, with EV and hybrid sales totaling 340,178 in December, including 190,754 all-electric cars, driven by aggressive end-of-year discounting.\u201d\n\nThe company is also looking to open a plant in Mexico as part of its global push. That\u2019s because BYD sees Mexico as a key market with big potential.\n\nIt opened plants in Thailand and announced plans to build a production facility in Hungary. Plus, it has plans to build a plant in Brazil and is now selling EVs in Indonesia.

        "content": "Despite the hit made by the six weeks-long UAW strike,\u00a0Stellantis N.V. (NYSE: STLA)\u00a0reported otherwise strong earnings for the full year. But the global auto giant reported a profit drop during the second half of 2023 due to halted production.\n\nStellantis Still Delivered Record 2023 Results, But They Were Not Stellar\n\nStellantis CEO Carlos Tavares admitted that aside from the UAW industrial action, Stellantis\u2019 U.S. performance was not stellar, despite 2023 being the third consecutive year of record results since the company was formed by a merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Groupe at the beginning of 2021.\n\nStellantis was the only major automaker to report a decline in U.S. sales last year. While Stellantis\u2019 market share dropped below 10%,\u00a0Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF)\u00a0outsold Stellantis for the first time ever. Hyundai, that consists of Kia, Genesis and Hyundai brands, had a very good year. As it surpassed Stellantis, Hyundai became the fourth best-selling automaker in the U.S. With its sales rising 12.1% to\u00a01,652,821 units, Hyundai is now behind General Motors (NYSE: GM), Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F).\n\nFord Went From 2022\u2019s Loss To 2023\u2019s Profit\n\nOn February 6th, Ford Motor topped fourth quarter estimates and forecasted better-than-expected 2024 outlook. For the full year, Ford reported revenue rose 11% YoY to\u00a0$176.2 billion.\u00a0Ford reported overall revenue grew 4% to $46 billion\u00a0with automotive revenue for the quarter amounting to\u00a0$43.2 billion, topping LSEG\u2019s\u00a0estimate of\u00a0$40.12 billion. But even though Ford had a solid year, it admitted it still wasn\u2019t near its earnings potential. Although Ford posted a $4.3 billion profit for the full year, it also recorded a fourth quarter loss.\n\nFord CEO\u00a0Jim Farley\u00a0summed up 2023 as a foundational year for Ford\u2019s future with cost improvements and modification of its strategy that includes hybrids\u00a0which are expected to boost this year\u2019s sales by 40%.\n\nStory continues\n\nGM Is Well Positioned For Another Strong Year\n\nBack in January, General Motors also topped Wall Street estimates and guided for strong 2024 profit despite headwinds. For the fourth quarter, GM reported flat revenue of $42.98 billion, topping LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$38.67 billion. Net income for stockholders amounted to $2.1 billion, or $1.59 per share with adjusted earnings per share of $1.24 topping LSEG\u2019s estimate of $1.16. As for 2023, GM reported revenue increased 10% YoY to $171.84 billion, a net income of $10.13 billion.\n\nStellantis\u2019 financial highlights show it is poised for a rock solid year.\n\nFor the full year, Stellantis repored net revenue rose 6% YoY to 189.5 billion euros with a 7% rise in consolidated shipment volume. Adjusted operating income for the year rose 1% to 24.3 billion euros, and industrial free cash flow grew 19% to 12.9 billion euros.\n\nStellantis\u2019\u00a0earnings showed the automaker\u2019s resilience to the impact of the industrial action, but it couldn\u2019t avoid getting hit. Moreover, its financial results prove that three years after its inception, the world\u2019s third-largest automaker by revenues deserved its place among global leaders in the automotive industry. Stellantis reiterated it plans to commit\u00a0at least 30 billion euros\u00a0to EVs and supporting technologies through 2025. This year, Stellantis plans to launch 18 new EVs in 2024, including eight in the U.S.\u00a0Despite expecting a turbulent year ahead, Stellantis is confident of\u00a0delivering another year of solid performance.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "TSLA Stock Warning: Why Tesla Is at the Start of a Long-Term Decline",
        "content": "Down 25% so far this year, the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock outlook isn\u2019t fantastic. The company looks to be at the beginning of a long-term decline as the company loses market share amidst growing competition in the electric vehicle space.\n\nTesla was the sole mass producer of fully electric vehicles for over a decade. Tesla sold poorly designed EVs at premium prices due to this advantage. If consumers wanted an EV, they had to buy a Tesla; not anymore. As companies ranging from General Motors (NYSE:GM) to Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) and Volkswagen (ETR:VOW3) scale their own EVs at more affordable prices, Tesla is getting left in the dust.\n\nNo Longer \u2018Magnificent\u2019\n\nDespite problems at the company, Tesla\u2019s stock and CEO Elon Musk remained unaffected. Despite poor quality ratings, deadly crashes, vehicle recalls, regulatory scrutiny, and social media controversies, TSLA stock continued to rally.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBetween 2011 and 2021, TSLA stock increased an astounding 20,250%, rising from just $2 a share on a split adjusted basis to more than $400. Tesla became a leading growth stock that was cheered on by retail investors.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock performance was so strong that analysts lumped the company in with a group of other mega-cap technology stocks that came to be known as the \u201cMagnificent 7.\u201d\n\nYet in reality, TSLA stock has trailed the performance of the other Mag 7 that includes Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Since hitting an all-time high in November 2021, Tesla\u2019s share price has fallen 54%. In a sign of shifting sentiment. Practically nobody is calling Tesla a top growth stock today.\n\nTSLA Stock Outlook: Losing Ground\n\nToyota best illustrates the competitive threat that Tesla is facing. The best-selling Japanese automaker plans to be selling 3.5 million fully electric vehicles annually by 2030. Eventually, Toyota plans to convert all of its vehicles to fully electric versions.\n\nStory continues\n\nToyota currently sells about 10 million cars, trucks and SUVs a year. Tesla sold 1.85 million vehicles in 2023. In a nice bit of irony, Toyota\u2019s stock is up 25% year-to-date, while Tesla\u2019s share price is down 25% since the start of the year.\n\nWhile Toyota provides an instructive example, it is one of more than a dozen automakers who are shifting to fully electric vehicles, most of which offer superior quality and lower prices than Tesla.\n\nTesla\u2019s share of its home market in America fell from 62% to 50% in 2023, a record low. That\u2019s a big loss of market share in a short amount of time, which bodes poorly for the TSLA stock outlook. It looks unlikely to reverse itself as competition intensifies in the coming months and years.\n\nCompounding Problems\n\nOther problems that are pulling TSLA stock lower include an economic slump in China that has hurt sales. There also have been aggressive price cuts and discounts around the world that have hurt Tesla\u2019s margins. Plus, Tesla has failed to introduce any new electric vehicles that are better made and more affordable to buy.\n\nThe Cybertruck that went on sale late last year looks interesting, but also seems impractical and has a starting price of more than $60,000. There are rumors that Tesla is developing a new mass market electric vehicle codenamed \u201cRedwood.\u201d\n\nBut that new EV is unlikely to be available before mid-2025, at the earliest. Meanwhile, Tesla delivered a dreadful earnings print for the fourth-quarter of last year, and offered grim guidance, with management saying electric vehicle volume growth in 2024 is likely to be \u201cnotably lower.\u201d\n\nSell TSLA Stock\n\nIt all seems to have caught up to Tesla and the once seemingly invincible automaker now appears to be vulnerable. The company is no longer able to get by on a lack of competition. Demand has weakened, market share is in freefall, and margins are being eroded.\n\nThe company\u2019s management team seems to lack creativity and new products have failed to inspire. With the share price sinking, investors would be smart to take any profits they have and get out now. TSLA stock is out of juice.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

        "title": "7 Undervalued Growth Stocks to Buy for 10x Returns by 2030",
        "content": "Patience can make you more money than any other factor in the market. Of course, the idea is to stay invested in the right stocks. Granted, current macroeconomic conditions are challenging with sluggish GDP growth and inflationary pressure. However, dig deep enough, and you\u2019ll find some of the most undervalued growth stocks with big potential.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss seven undervalued growth stocks to buy and hold for 10x returns by 2030.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is among the top, most undervalued growth stocks worth holding until 2030. Once the Chinese markets stabilize and recover, I expect the stock to skyrocket.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOne reason to like Li Auto is its strong fundamentals. As of Q3 2023, the Company reported a cash buffer of $12.13 billion. Further, the free cash flow (FCF) for the quarter was $1.8 billion. Considering the growth trajectory, Li could report an FCF of more than $10 billion in the next 12 to 24 months.\n\nFor 2024, Li Auto has guided for vehicle deliveries of 800,000. This is an ambitious target with 2023 deliveries at 376,030 vehicles. With the commercial launch of Li MEGA due in March, stellar deliveries growth is likely to be supported.\n\nMINISO Group (MNSO) red Miniso (MNSO) sign glowing at night\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Hendrick Wu\n\nMINISO Group (NYSE:MNSO) is another undervalued growth stock poised for multi-bagger returns. The sell-off from the September 2023 highs is a good accumulation opportunity.\n\nAs an overview, Miniso is a lifestyle retailer with a global presence. The company differentiates itself through attractive pricing coupled with a dynamic product portfolio. For Q1 2024, Miniso reported revenue growth of 36% on a year-on-year basis to $519.6 million. For the same period, the Company reported a 52.8% year-on-year growth in adjusted EBITDA to $139 million. Healthy revenue growth for Miniso has been associated with EBITDA margin expansion.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that as of Q1 2024, Miniso reported 6,115 stores globally. On a year-on-year basis, the number of stores increased by 819. Aggressive store expansion in China and overseas will ensure that revenue growth remains robust. It\u2019s worth noting that MNSO stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 2.53% and I expect healthy dividend growth in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is a lithium miner focused on the commercialization of the Thacker Pass asset in the U.S. While the Company is not currently generating revenue, I expect stellar growth once production commences.\n\nUndervalued at current prices, I\u2019d accumulate the stock and hold it for the long-term potential.\n\nTo put things into perspective, Lithium Americas commands a market valuation of $670 million. In comparison, the company\u2019s Thacker Pass asset has an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion. Further, with a mine life of 40 years and an average annual EBITDA potential of $1.1 billion, the asset is a free cash flow machine.\n\nOnce lithium trends higher, LAC stock is likely to skyrocket because the project is well-financed for construction. General Motors (NYSE:GM) will be investing $650 million in two tranches and has an offtake agreement for 10 years for lithium from phase one. It\u2019s a matter of holding this potential value creator with patience.\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) DraftKings website in browser with company logo\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nDraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) is another one of the top, most undervalued growth stocks with big potential. As more states legalize iGaming and OSB (online sports book), the market potential is likely to swell in the next five years. This puts into perspective the headroom for growth.\n\nSpecific to DraftKings, the company was struggling with EBITDA level losses. However, that\u2019s reversed and DraftKings expects adjusted EBITDA of $400 million (mid-point of guidance) for 2024.\n\nThe company further expects to boost adjusted EBITDA to $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion by 2026 and 2028 respectively. This guidance does not incorporate potential entry into new states. DraftKings is positioned for healthy growth in a big addressable market.\n\nAmdocs (DOX) A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) has an attractive dividend yield of 2.18%.\n\nThe provider of software and services to the telecommunication and media industry globally just reported revenue of $1.25 billion and a 12-month backlog of $4.21 billion. Further, Amdocs has guided for a free cash flow of $750 million for the year. With a strong liquidity buffer ($1.1 billion) and healthy cash flows, Amdocs is positioned to invest aggressively in technology and potential acquisition-driven growth.\n\nAn important point to note is that the rising adoption of 5G presents a big market opportunity for Amdocs. By 2025, the Company believes that the serviceable addressable market is likely to be $57 billion. The Company is supporting some of the telecommunication majors for the launch of innovative 5G services and monetization opportunities.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that Amdocs will have annual FCF of more than $1 billion in the next 24 months. This will provide ample headroom for shareholder value creation.\n\nCoupang (CPNG) A close-up shot of a Coupang (CPNG) delivery vehicle.\n\nSource: Ki young / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce stocks are yet to recover in a post-pandemic era. There are spots of attractive valuation and I believe that Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) is among the growth stocks to buy. CPNG stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months and looks poised for a breakout. My view is underscored by the fact that financial developments remain good.\n\nFor Q3 2023, Coupang reported revenue growth of 21% on a year-on-year basis to $6.2 billion. For the same period, the company\u2019s adjusted EBITDA was $239 million. Also, for the trailing 12 months, Coupang reported a free cash flow of $1.9 billion. As FCF accelerates, I expect CPNG stock to trend higher.\n\nLooking at business metrics, Coupang reported 14% year-on-year growth in active customers to 20 million in Q3 2023. Further, the net revenue per active customer increased by 7% on a year-on-year basis. These metrics point to potential expansion in EBITDA margin if ARPU growth sustains.\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) Concept art of crypto mining with little figuring and a Bitcoin token.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) could continue to push higher with Bitcoin (BTC-USD).\n\nAs an overview, Riot Platforms is a Bitcoin miner with aggressive expansion plans. The first point to note is that Riot has a zero-debt balance sheet. Further, as of Q3 2023, the Company reported cash and digital assets of $599 million. Therefore, there is ample financial flexibility for aggressive investments.\n\nIn terms of expansion, Riot reported hash rate capacity of 12.4EH/s towards the end of 2023. The Company expects to increase capacity to 28.8EH/s this year. Further, by the end of 2025, capacity is likely at 38.1EH/s. I must add that if Riot exercises the option to purchase additional MicroBT miners, capacity is likely to increase to 100EH/s in the next few years. If this expansion is associated with new highs in Bitcoin, the Company will be delivering robust free cash flows.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "On February 13, the market received a hotter-than-expected January CPI report. A broad stock market selloff ensued as investors began questioning the extent of rate cuts given the sticky inflation. Growth stocks could stall if rate cut expectations start falling, whereas the best bargain stocks to buy might catch a bid.\n\nAlthough there are no guarantees in the market, mean reversion often happens. It could occur again due to the huge dispersion in performance between growth and value over the last year. Growth stocks, fueled by the artificial intelligence wave, have surged to new highs. Meanwhile, value stocks are lagging and trading at dirt-cheap valuations.\n\nWith the potential for an upset in monetary policy, the best bargain stocks to buy present a favorable risk-reward. Coming into the year, the market participants were expecting six rate cuts from the Federal Reserve beginning in March. But Fed Chair Powell has dispelled this view in his 60 Minutes interview. Moreover, the timeline for rate cuts might have been pushed further out with the hot CPI report.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHigher for longer means that growth stocks could take a breather with investors rotating into value stocks. This article discusses three trading at a significant discount, below 5 times forward earnings, yet they have a positive earnings outlook.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAuto manufacturers had some serious headwinds in 2023. New union contracts that increased costs, slowing electric vehicle demand and intensifying competition all challenged the sector. These issues have left General Motors (NYSE:GM) trading at 2019 levels.\n\nHowever, the situation is not as dire, and General Motors is one of the best bargain stocks to buy. Regarding cost worries, the company has disclosed that it will adjust its 2024 budget to offset incremental labor costs from the new union contract. What\u2019s more, the $10 billion accelerated share repurchase announced in November 2023 is another boost to shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn January 30, the stock jumped 7.8% following solid Q4 sales and profit beat. Despite challenges in the electric vehicle (EV) market and the impact of a UAW strike, quarterly results were solid. Revenues were $42.9 billion, a slight 0.3% year-over-year decline.\n\nFor the full year, revenue was $171.84 billion, a 9.64% increase from 2022. Meanwhile, net income was $10.12 billion, up by 1.9%. Additionally, the company issued a bullish profit outlook for 2024. Management expects net income in the range of $9.8 to $11.2 billion and diluted EPS between $8.50 and $9.50. This guidance leaves GM stock trading at dirt cheap 4.5 times forward earnings.\n\nIn terms of growth plans, General Motors has scaled back its electric vehicle rollout. However, it still expects to grow the business. Notably, the company is seeing huge interest in its Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac and BrightDrop EVs. Management expects the U.S. EV portfolio to hit variable profitability in the second half of 2024.\n\nGiven GM\u2019s robust financial performance and positive outlook for 2024, analysts are bullish. The stock has 17 \u201cbuy\u201d ratings, with an average price target of 49, suggesting over 20% gain.\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL) The side of a United Airlines (UAL) plane with \"united\" written above passenger windows. Represents airline stocks.\n\nSource: travelview / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnited Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) has one of the best growth outlooks in the airline industry, yet it trades at a mid-single-digit price-to-earnings. Furthermore, air traffic has recovered to pre-pandemic levels and could strengthen as corporate travel rebounds. That\u2019s why analysts are mostly bullish and see over 30% upside from current prices.\n\nIn terms of growth, this airline is undertaking a significant fleet expansion and modernization effort. The airline plans to introduce over 200 widebody planes to accommodate the growing demand for air travel and improve service. As of this writing, it has over 170 new aircraft in its fleet and plans to add over 800 new planes by 2032.\n\nThis expansion is part of United\u2019s broader strategic growth plan, which includes increasing its trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific flights. It is adding new nonstop flights to the Asia-Pacific region, including Manila, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei. Also, it\u2019s forging strategic collaborations with global airlines to enhance its network. United\u2019s partnership with Emirates, for example, will significantly expand its reach in the Middle East and India.\n\nToday, United is the largest carrier across the Atlantic and Pacific. It has a comprehensive service network across North America, Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America. As it expands its fleets and increases its international routes, United will experience a steady rise in revenues over the next decade.\n\nAs of this writing, the market isn\u2019t pricing the upcoming growth over the next decade. According to Finviz, UAL stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings of 4, yet it will grow earnings by 42% annually over the next five years. This stock is one of the best bargain stocks to buy today.\n\nVital Energy (VTLE) A concept image of a person's hands holding a plant with floating glowing particles around it\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAfter a series of acquisitions in 2023 totaling nearly $2 billion, Vital Energy (NYSE:VTLE) has positioned itself as a significant player in the Permian. It acquired assets from Driftwood Energy, Forge Energy, Henry Resources, Tall City Exploration III and Maple Energy Holdings.\n\nThese deals have been advantageous for several reasons. First, they have significantly increased its scale in the Midland and Delaware Basins. Secondly, Vital Energy added thousands of net acres and enhanced its oil production capacity, doubling the company\u2019s size. Thirdly, they have shifted its production profile to 48% oil by volume, marking a significant transformation.\n\nGiven the flurry of mergers and acquisitions in the Permian Basin, Vital Energy could be an attractive takeover candidate. Its aggressive expansion and improved oil weighting could endear suitors in a consolidating market. Also, the company\u2019s strategy of targeting Tier 2 assets aligns with the industry trend of seeking acquisitions that provide drilling longevity and operational synergies.\n\nFor now, management is focused on integrating the acquisitions and extracting cost synergies. According to the latest investor presentation, management expects $375 million in free cash flow in 2024. Thus, VTLE stock is one of the best bargain stocks to buy in the energy sector at a bargain 4 times forward free cash flow.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "0922 ki col mcleod.KI\n\nA Quebec miner looking to weaken China\u2019s grip on the graphite market has inked deals to supply General Motors Co. and Panasonic Holdings Corp. with a commodity that\u2019s required to make electric-vehicle batteries.\n\nAnode materials in EV batteries are mostly made from graphite and Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. has agreed to provide 18,000 tonnes of it for multiple years to both companies once it starts production.\n\n\u201cThis (agreement) is really what we were missing from North America, a clear commitment from tier-one customers,\u201d Nouveau\u2019s chief executive Eric Desaulniers said. \u201cWe really need this strategic graphite anode material. We cannot just rely 100 per cent on China today.\u201d\n\nThe demand for EV batteries is expected to rise as the world looks to gradually transition away from fossil fuels. Several western nations including Canada and the United States have introduced policies to encourage this transition.\n\nHowever, production of the critical minerals required to make these batteries is largely controlled by China, the world\u2019s leading producer of graphite and a country the West is trying to reduce its reliance on for raw materials.\n\nOnce Nouveau starts production, it will supply GM for six years and Panasonic for seven. The sales price will depend on future prevailing market prices, Nouveau said. GM has also committed to invest US$150 million in the company in two phases, while Panasonic has agreed to invest US$25 million.\n\nTogether, the supply agreements will make up about 85 per cent of Nouveau\u2019s future production, which Desaulniers said is enough to make a final investment decision on its battery materials plant that it hopes to build.\n\nThe company is currently looking to advance its battery materials plant project in B\u00e9cancour, about 150 kilometres northeast of Montreal on the Saint Lawrence River.\n\nAlong with its proposed battery plant, Nouveau is also developing its Matawinie mine project in Saint-Michel-des-Saints, Que. The plan is to mine the graphite from Matawinie and refine it in the battery plant, with production starting in early 2027.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike with many other battery materials, the price of graphite has fallen in the last year.\n\nWatershed year for EVs paving way for billions in new investment U.S. Department of Defense funds Canadian graphite miner\n\n\u201cNobody is making money at the current graphite price,\u201d Desaulniers said. \u201cTo justify projects in North America, you need agreements like we got today.\u201d\n\nGM and Panasonic both described the agreements as milestones for the North American battery industry.\n\nNouveau\u2019s share price rose 28 per cent, or 76 cents, to $3.56 on the Toronto Stock Exchange by midday on Feb. 15. The company has a market cap of around $238 million.\n\n\u2022 Email: nkarim@postmedia.com\n\nBookmark our website and support our journalism: Don\u2019t miss the business news you need to know \u2014 add financialpost.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here.",

        "title": "Stellantis stock pops on new buyback, but automaker warns of 'turbulent' year ahead",
        "content": "Stellantis (STLA) \u2014 the parent company of Chrysler and Fiat, among other brands \u2014 reported full-year results and announced a new share buyback plan that sent the stock higher, despite warning of a \u201cturbulent\u201d year ahead.\n\nFor 2023, Stellantis reported revenue of 189.5 billion euros ($204 billion) vs. 189.3 billion euros ($204 billion) estimated, which was up 6% compared to 2022, with global deliveries increasing 7%. Adjusted net income came in at 18.6 billion euros ($20.04 billion) vs. 18.4 billion euros ($19.83 billion) expected, up 11% compared to a year ago. Adjusted operating income rose 1% to 24.3 billion euros ($26.2 billion) with adjusted operating income margin of 12.8%\n\nThe Netherlands-based Stellantis, the last Big Three automaker to report earnings this cycle, also said it will repurchase 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) of shares this year, adding to a buyback from last year. The company also announced a dividend of 1.55 euros ($1.67) per share, up 16% compared to last year. Logansport - August 3, 2023: Ram 1500 display at a Stellantis dealership. Ram offers the 1500 in Rebel, Laramie, Big Horn, and Tradesman models. (jetcityimage via Getty Images)\n\nOn the downside, the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike that lingered into October hit operating margins, with its adjusted operating income margin dropping to 11.2% in the second half of the year from 12.3% in the same period in 2022. This led the adjusted operating income for the second half of the year to slide 10% to 10.2 billion euros ($10.9 billion).\n\nStellantis previously said the strikes hit profits by $808.1 million last year and by approximately $3.23 billion in terms of revenue. But because of higher pricing power, the post-strike labor costs won\u2019t affect Stellantis as much as they will Ford (F) or GM (GM). \"So the impact for us is certainly going to be on an overall level lower than what you've seen from our peers,\" CFO Natalie Knight said in a media call.\n\nLooking ahead, Stellantis projected a minimum commitment of double-digit adjusted operating income margin in 2024 and positive industrial cash flow but warned of a tough year ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"There\u2019s a much more normalized supply environment, a much more normalized pricing environment than what we\u2019ve seen in the past,\" Knight said in the media call. \"We\u2019re resilient for what we think is going to be a pretty turbulent year.\" She added on the earnings call that \"there's more headwinds that there are tailwinds.\"\n\nIn its presentation, Stellantis said headwinds included factors like the impact of the EV product mix, lower prices, and labor costs that would weigh on the adjusted operating income margin in 2024.\n\nOutlook and flexible EV game plan Jeep offers the Grand Cherokee 4xe with a 2.0 liter engine and electric motor. (Getty Images) (jetcityimage via Getty Images)\n\nOn the flip side, Stellantis' measured approach to EVs is paying off for the automaker, as it didn\u2019t go all in on full EVs. Stellantis said it is No. 1 in PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric) sales in the US (136,000), doubling sales year over year, with industry-leading margins for its cars in the US. Models like the Jeep Wrangler and Grand Cherokee 4xe PHEVs have been selling well, though the company will have its fully electric Jeep Wagoneer S going on sale in the fall of this year.\n\nCEO Carlos Tavares touted the new upcoming 2025 Ram 1500 pickup on the earnings call, as well as versions of the truck that will offer a fully electric powertrain and 500 miles of range and a \"Ramcharger\" version that operates similar to a plug-in hybrid.\n\nTavares was criticized in the past for not moving faster with the company\u2019s EV transition; now he is looking somewhat prescient as demand for EVs has seemingly waned in recent months. Tavares did say the present plan is to keep its Dare Forward EV transition going \"flat out\" as the EV transition is still expected to happen, though more gradually.\n\nPart of that plan meant using platforms that could accommodate both pure electric and gas-powered powertrains while other legacy automakers have pursued different dedicated platforms. Tavares said shared platforms are the best approach from a cost perspective.

(MARCO BERTORELLO/AFP via Getty Images) (MARCO BERTORELLO via Getty Images)\n\n\"The benefit to the consumer of having a dedicated [EV] platform is almost nil compared to the diversity complexity that you generate [with shared platforms],\" he said. \"Despite the criticism, it happens that in an uncertain world today, it's the right decision.\"\n\nTavares also warned of a growing EV competition from China.\n\n\"The margin parity [between EVs and gas-powered cars] is something that we believe we need to do, and we believe we need to do it fast because it is the best protection against the Chinese offensive,\" Tavares said.\n\nAnd that also means profitability with EVs. Tavares said Stellantis EVs on sale in Europe are already profitable and that the company is aiming for profitability in North America in 2025.\n\nIn terms of its rivals this earnings season, shares of fellow Big Three automakers Ford and GM have surged following strong earnings reports, as the two Michigan-based automakers\u2019 traditional gas-powered businesses are projecting robust profits for 2024.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 15, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, General Motors Co. GM, American Airlines AAL, Synchrony Financial SYF and Textron Inc. TXT.\n\n5 Lucrative PEG-Based Value Stocks for Investors\n\nIn a market dealing with external shocks, value investing is fast gaining popularity. The success of value investors like Warren Buffett underscores this. Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, managed to register more than 20% CAGR for Berkshire Hathaway from 1965 through 2022. This compares favorably with a 10% rise of the S&P 500 Index during the same period.\n\nSeveral stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, have shown the overwhelming success of this pure-play investment strategy. Here, we discuss five such stocks \u2014 Royal Caribbean Cruises, General Motors Co., American Airlines, Synchrony Financial and Textron Inc..\n\nMore on Value Investing\n\nWhile searching for a suitable investment option, value investors with a varied risk appetite are unlikely to consider the price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio among several other popular metrics like price/earnings (P/E), price/sales and price/book value (P/B).\n\nThis is because they often find this ratio complicated, considering the limitations in calculating a stock's future earnings growth potential. Yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, are commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount.\n\nHowever, while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock, these ratios might end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show. This might often lead to \"value traps\" \u2014 a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once pulled down the share price, turn out to be persistent.\n\nIn such a case, even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value, you might still end up paying more. And here comes the importance of this not-so-popular but crucial value investing metric, the PEG ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth Rate\n\nA low PEG ratio is always better for value investors.\n\nWhile P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock.\n\nThere are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio. It doesn't consider the very common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term.\n\nHence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.\n\nHere are five out of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nRoyal Caribbean: Based in Miami, Royal Caribbean is a cruise company. It owns and operates three global brands \u2014 Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises. Additionally, it has a 50% investment in a joint venture with TUI AG, which operates the brand TUI Cruises. The company's cruise brands primarily serve the contemporary, premium and deluxe segments of the cruise vacation industry, which also includes the budget and luxury segments.\n\nRoyal Caribbean currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Value Score of A. Royal Caribbean also has an impressive five-year expected growth rate of 26.7%. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nGeneral Motors: It held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16.2% in 2023. Headquartered in Detroit, the auto giant is stepping up efforts to embrace an electric future and gain a strong foothold in the fast-growing market. The automaker plans to roll out 30 fresh electric vehicle models by 2025-end.\n\nApart from a discounted PEG and P/E, GM currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A. General Motors has a long-term expected growth rate of 9%.\n\nAmerican Airlines: The company was formed following the December 2013 merger between AMR (American Airlines' parent group) and U.S. Airways. The merger resulted in the formation of the largest airline internationally. American Airlines Group is headquartered in Fort Worth, TX. This Delaware corporation's wholly-owned subsidiaries are American Airlines, Envoy Aviation Group, PSA Airlines and Piedmont Airlines. The company's primary business is to provide passenger and cargo services.\n\nAmerican Airlines has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 49.5%. AAL currently has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank of 2.\n\nSynchrony Financial: Being one of the nation's premier consumer financial services companies, it offers a wide range of credit products through a diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and health and wellness providers. Synchrony Financial focuses on generating financial flexibility for its customers by offering private label credit cards, Dual Card, and general purpose co-branded credit cards, promotional financing and installment lending, and loyalty programs.\n\nApart from a discounted PEG and P/E, SYF currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A. Synchrony Financial has a long-term historical growth rate of 7.9%.\n\nTextron: It is a global multi-industry company that manufactures aircraft, automotive engine components and industrial tools. It also offers solutions and services for aircraft, fastening systems, and industrial products and components. Its products include commercial and military helicopters, light- and mid-size business jets, plastic fuel tanks, automotive trim products, golf carts and utility vehicles, turf-car equipment, industrial pumps and gears.\n\nApart from a discounted PEG and P/E, Textron currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of B. Textron has a long-term historical growth rate of 11.9%.\n\nYou can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

        "title": "Not Just Nvidia! 7 More Stocks Hitting New Highs",
        "content": "\u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d components like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) aren\u2019t the only stocks hitting new highs. As of this writing, plenty of stocks outside of the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d and outside of the tech sector, for that matter, have recently hit record highs.\n\nGiven that major indices, such as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, have hit new highs this month, this is not surprising. However, several stocks are continuing to hit new high watermarks, even as, in recent trading days, the broad market has pulled back, following the release of a hotter-than-expected inflation print.\n\nCompany-specific catalysts are helping these stocks reach new heights, even as another wave of macro uncertainty has potentially hit the stock market once again. The question now, however, is whether this strong performance can continue.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo find out, let\u2019s take a look at seven of these stocks hitting new highs, and see whether their latest moves are an invitation to buy, or a warning to sell.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) The front of an Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location.\n\nSource: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s an understatement to say that, over the past year, shares in apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) have been on fire. This stock has surged 276.3% during this time frame. In recent trading days, it has remarked on a sharply upward trajectory.\n\nImproved fiscal results have been the key factor driving ANF stock dramatically higher. While full year results aren\u2019t expected until March 6, forecasts call for ANF\u2019s earnings for fiscal year ending January 2024 to come in at $6.10 per share. For reference, ANF reported earnings of just 6 cents per share last fiscal year.\n\nStill, while Abercrombie & Fitch has been a profitable turnaround stock, it may be high time to cash out. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Ian Bezek argued last month, it may not take much to cause operating performance to weaken again. This would likely cause a massive reversal for shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A,BRK.B) A Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) sign sits out front of an office in Lafayette, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A,NYSE:BRK.B) is one of the stocks hitting new highs lately. Admittedly, it may not be 100% accurate to say that Berkshire, legendary investor Warren Buffett\u2019s main investing vehicle, is a non-tech stock.\n\nAfter all, investing in BRK.B provides you indirect exposure to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Berkshire owns a 5.8% stake in the iPhone maker, worth around $167.6 billion.\n\nThat represents nearly 20% of the holding company\u2019s total market cap. As you likely know, Berkshire owns a smattering of companies across multiple sectors, as well as positions in numerous publicly-traded companies.\n\nSo, with BRK.B stock knocking it out of the park lately, is it time to buy? It depends. Though some (like this Seeking Alpha commentator) believe the stock can sustain its current premium to book value (around 65%), waiting for weakness may be a better move.\n\nDiamondback Energy (FANG) Diamondback Energy (FANG) logo on its website to represent oil stocks. FANG stock\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrude oil prices have only partially recovered recently, and natural gas prices have been trending sharply lower. However, that hasn\u2019t stopped shares in oil & gas exploration and production company Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) from performing strongly lately.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s been merger news, not energy prices, that have resulted in FANG stock climbing to a new all-time high this week.\n\nOn Feb. 12, Diamondback announced plans to acquire Endeavor Energy Resources, in a cash and stock deal. Including the value of Endeavor\u2019s outstanding debt, this merger has a transaction value of around $26 billion.\n\nWall Street has reacted positively to this deal news. In large part, due to the perception that, by buying Endeavor, Diamondback is further strengthening its Permian Basin asset base.\n\nAs this deal could help FANG sustain high levels of profitability and its return of capital efforts (dividends and buybacks), more upside may lie ahead.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group (IBKR) close up of one hundred dollar bills\n\nSource: Ruslan Ivantsov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased on recent trends, it\u2019s not surprising that Interactive Brokers Group (NASDAQ:IBKR) have been performing particularly well lately.\n\nAs InvestorPlace\u2019s Larry Ramer recently pointed out, the stock brokerage firm is benefitting from both high interest rates and the emergence of a new bull market.\n\nHigh interest rates are benefitting IBKR, as these have resulted in higher interest income on uninvested funds held in customer accounts. Increased stock market participation has resulted in Interactive Brokers\u2019 monthly transaction volume. After becoming one stock hitting new highs, will IBKR stock keep climbing?\n\nCurrent trends may persist, as rates remain elevated, but investors still get back into \u201crisk on\u201d mode, in anticipation of lower rates down the road, creating further transaction volume growth. Last year, there was also talk of IBKR being an AI play. Further developments supporting an AI-related bull case for IBKR could also help shares keep trending higher.\n\nToyota Motor (TM) Toyota (TM) logo on the building of a dealership during daylight\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nEV stocks have been tumbling. Shares in U.S.-based incumbent automaker stocks have been moving higher, but shares in Japan-based global automotive giant Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) have been performing especially well lately.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t assume that the out-performance of TM stock will continue. As a Barron\u2019s commentator recently argued, it\u2019s possible that Toyota shares have performed well, simply because the company did not hype its EV pivot. U.S.-based automakers like Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are suffering in the aftermath of the \u201cEV bubble.\u201d\n\nToyota\u2019s earnings are expected to be flat during the upcoming fiscal year (ending March 2025). Unless further news about the company\u2019s plug-in and battery electric vehicle production ramp-up efforts really excite the market, TM stock\u2019s hot run (shares are up 60.6% over the past year) could soon end.\n\nWaste Management (WM) Image of green Waste Management (WM) branded truck in the foreground and building with Waste Management flag in the background.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe phrase \u201ctrash is cash\u201d has really held true lately, for Waste Management (NYSE:WM) a leader in the (what else) waste management industry. Shares are up 30.6% over the past year, and recently spiked after reporting strong quarterly results.\n\nWaste Management has become one stock hitting new highs. Several factors may explain why the market has become very bullish about WM stock.\n\nThese include the recession-resistant nature of its business, and the company\u2019s continued steady earnings growth. However, as a result of this excitement, WM has become pricey.\n\nShares currently trade for 29 times forward earnings. That\u2019s well above WM\u2019s historic earnings multiple in the high-teens/low-20s.\n\nIf interest rates come down lower this year as expected, this valuation may be sustainable. If not, though, this stock could be at risk of experiencing a moderate de-rating to a lower valuation.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWeak outlook led to a post-earnings tanking for Walmart (NYSE:WMT) last November, but shares in the leading retailer just this week completed a recovery, hitting new all-time highs.\n\nThat said, what\u2019s likely been driving this strong performance could be a warning sign to treat carefully.\n\nHow so? Next week, Walmart releases its earnings results for the quarter ending Jan. 31, 2024. Shares have moved higher, to some extent, on the expectation that robust spending during the holiday season means an increased likelihood that the company will beat on earnings. However, if results (or updates to guidance) fail to wow the market, WMT stock could quickly give back its latest gains.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Walmart will soon retreat back to the low $150s per share, but if you\u2019ve been looking to enter a long-term position in the retailer, a much better entry point could soon emerge.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nThomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "When an asset class or sector is in a long-term bull market, it does not imply that stocks move vertically higher. The implication is that stocks remain in an uptrend for 5 or 10 years. Within that uptrend, there can be periods of intermediate correction where stocks can decline by 30% to 50%.\n\nIn my view, the electric vehicle (EV) sector is in a long-term bull market. However, the sector faces macroeconomic, inflationary and supply chain headwinds. That has translated into a correction for some of the best EV stocks to buy.\n\nThis column looks at three EV stocks that have witnessed a deep correction. Further, these stocks represent quality companies, and I believe the bounce back from oversold levels is likely to be sharp. I am bullish on some quick returns from these names, and I also believe these EV stocks to buy are worth holding until 2030.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLi Auto (LI) The steering wheel and dashboard inside Li Auto electric car. Interior of Li Auto EV. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) has delivered stellar growth on a sustained basis. However, it\u2019s worth noting that LI stock has declined by 25% in the last six months. The reason is weak sentiments for Chinese stocks. I see this correction as a golden opportunity to buy LI stock poised for multibagger returns in the long term.\n\nFor 2023, Li Auto delivered 376,030 vehicles, which was higher by 182.2% year-over-year. For the current year, the company set an ambitious target of delivering 800,000 vehicles. If this holds true, Li Auto will be positioned for robust cash flow upside.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Li reported $12.13 billion in cash and equivalents as of Q3 2023. For the quarter, the company also reported free cash flow (FCF) of $1.8 billion. Given the growth trajectory, I would not be surprised if Li Auto reports FCF of around $10 billion this year. With high financial flexibility, the company will be positioned to invest in expansion and product innovation.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThe big plunge in lithium prices has presented a golden opportunity to accumulate quality lithium miners. Once the trends for lithium reverses, I expect multibagger returns from the best lithium stocks.Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is among my top picks at current levels of $4.20. I see the stock trading in double digits in quick time.\n\nAn important point to note is there are expectations of a lithium shortage as soon as 2025. Further, it\u2019s expected the lithium supply gap will be acute by 2035. That underscores my bullish view on lithium.\n\nSpecific to Lithium Americas, the company currently commands a market valuation of $730 million. In comparison, the company\u2019s Thacker Pass asset has an after-tax net present value of $5.4 billion. With a mine life of 40 years and an average annual EBITDA expectation of $1.1 billion, the asset is a potential cash flow machine.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Lithium Americas has General Motors (NYSE:GM) as a strategic partner for the project. GM will be investing $650 million on two tranches. Further, the company signed a 10-year offtake agreement for lithium from phase one.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith Elon Musk warning about competition and pressure on margins, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock declined by 26% year-to-date. Being an innovator, I believe Tesla is positioned to navigate challenges and continue to grow. The correction, therefore, presents a good buying opportunity.\n\nThe manager of the Baron Focused Growth Fund expects TSLA stock to touch $1,200 by 2030. That would imply 6.5x returns from current levels. I will not be surprised if this happens, with Tesla having an ambitious target to produce 20 million EVs annually by 2030. Of course, this is the long-term outlook.\n\nI am, however, bullish on a sharp reversal for TSLA stock, even for the near term. The reason is an attractive product line-up that includes Cybertruck, Roadster and Tesla Semi. I am also expecting Elon Musk to announce potential factories in emerging markets. The company is already aiming to cut manufacturing costs to half. If that is achieved, Tesla can target the mass market in emerging economies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "EV stocks could offer significant gains amid a bull market, outperforming other tech stocks with stretched valuations. This sector\u2019s consistent and robust growth potential makes it resilient to different market conditions and cycles. So, many investors have been loyal to this space over the past decade.\n\nYet, the EV sector is moving beyond Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as a one-horse race. A myriad of competitors stand ready to take market share and witness outsized growth.\n\nPlenty of promise in this sector abounds. And, a large portion of all international vehicles sales will be electric vehicles by 2030 (the majority, according to some estimates). Therefore, we\u2019re going to need a lot of lithium and other raw materials to support this growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThus, let\u2019s dive into three EV and EV-related stocks worth considering now.\n\nBYD Co. (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nBYD Co.\u2019s (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) journey to becoming one of the most sought-after EV manufacturers was not a smooth ride. Initially coming to market as a battery maker, BYDDF shifted to making cars in 2003, a move that startled a lot of investors and experts.\n\nHowever, this move has proven to be the right choice. Recently, BYD surpassed Tesla in EV car sales. Currently expanding more globally, the company is poised for continued long-term growth.\n\nNow, 2023 was a massive success for BYD Co. as it achieved a massive milestone of 1.6 million EV deliveries. This represented a 73% surge from 2022. Its affordable models, like the Atto 3 and Seal sedan, are gaining traction globally. Creating expansions worldwide, BYDDF is a threatening competitor to other global EV manufacturers.\n\nAlso, BYD Co. revealed plans to collaborate with Korean institutes to introduce EVs in Korea. The Korean Economic Daily reported that environmental and safety certifications are prerequisites, including range and battery safety. BYDDF\u2019s Atto 3 will likely debut as its first EV model, following a sales record overseas.\n\nStory continues\n\nPresently, the stock trades at 17-times earnings, what I would consider to be a relative bargain considering the company\u2019s impressive growth potential.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nInitially known for its lithium assets in Nevada and Argentina, Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is a stock investors shouldn\u2019t underestimate.\n\nDespite being early in its development cycle, with production slated for 2026, LAC stock remains undervalued. Analysts project substantial long-term growth potential, foreseeing a surge in value amid changing demand dynamics and rising lithium prices.\n\nAmid global EV growth, the American market shows slow acceptance. Lithium Americas eyes profits from North American EV battery expansion. Despite a 60% one-year loss, optimism remains. In 2022, battery-grade lithium carbonate hit record highs but has since stabilized. Forecasts anticipate doubling demand by 2030.\n\nAlthough the stock declined 36% year to date (YTD) amid negative lithium sentiment, long-term bullishness remains due to the company\u2019s asset potential. General Motors (NYSE:GM) is a strategic partner, investing $650 million with a ten-year offtake agreement for phase one production, ensuring cash flow visibility. Plus, with a market cap of $743 million, the company focuses on lithium mining and production, positioning it well for the rising demand for EV batteries over time.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother growth-oriented EV stock every investor should consider is Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI). Despite declining in the latter half of 2023, its strong January 2024 comeback is achieving an impressive deliveries growth of 105.8%. With an ambitious goal of 800,000 annual deliveries and the upcoming Li MEGA launch in March, accelerated growth is anticipated.\n\nIts flagship Li L7 model competes directly with Tesla\u2019s Model Y, offering electric and gasoline power versatility. Despite a 17% dip in 2024, Li Auto\u2019s strong growth in 2023, with total deliveries surpassing 600,000 vehicles, suggests significant potential in China\u2019s EV market.\n\nBoasting a presence in 142 cities and 474 retail stores, continued penetration in China supports market share expansion. With $12.13 billion in cash and strong free cash flows, LI has ample resources for aggressive expansion and innovation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "7 Tech Stocks to Buy Amid the Flying Pink Slips",
        "content": "It\u2019s always rough to deal with layoffs but if you\u2019re looking at tech stocks to buy from a pure profit standpoint, reduced spending on either non-core units or businesses that just don\u2019t pass muster may be beneficial in the long run. Again, it\u2019s a terrible situation for workers and it\u2019s something that could be increasingly common.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Wall Street is loving the pink slips flying. True, investors have been enamored with tech stocks to buy, particularly those centered on artificial intelligence and other happening sectors. However, the ecosystem is also attempting to find its footing after a hiring boom during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nUnfortunately for individual employees, management must find a delicate balance between preserving dizzying equity gains and keeping the show running. Invariably, then, some cuts have to be made. It\u2019s a raw deal but you can at least profit from the mess with these tech stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) undoubtedly commands significant respect within the broader ecosystem of tech stocks to buy, it\u2019s also fair to point out that it\u2019s had its fair share of troubles. According to a local ABC report, Intel laid off almost 2,000 California-based employees over one year from December 2022. After leading in its semiconductor specialty, the company is struggling to find its footing.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t worrying enough, INTC got off to a slow start in the new year. Still, investors should remember that shares performed relatively well in 2023. With a more focused approach to the business \u2013 specifically businesses where the company is competitive \u2013 there\u2019s no reason why Intel can\u2019t turn things around.\n\nFor example, Intel carries significant acumen in data center chips. According to Grand View Research, the global data center market size reached a valuation of $194.81 billion in 2022. Further, it could expand at a compound annual growth rate of 10.9% to 2030, culminating in sector revenue of $437.33 billion. Analysts do rate shares a consensus hold. However, the high-side target lands at a very robust $68.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a giant in internet technologies, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) probably enjoys permanent relevance. For example, its Google-connected ecosystem is ubiquitous. As well, when people search for whatever they want online, they\u2019re doing so through the Google search engine. It\u2019s not just a platform, it\u2019s a verb, an admonishment and a big component of our cultural identity.\n\nHowever, this dominance hasn\u2019t exempted Alphabet from harsh business realities. As The New York Times recently noted in its headlines, Google\u2019s once happy offices now feel the chill of layoffs. I\u2019ve expressed this point before but it absolutely stinks for layoffs to materialize. I would know because I\u2019ve been on the other side.\n\nStill, if a substantive positive exists, it\u2019s this: if you\u2019re smart enough to be hired by Google, you\u2019re more than smart enough to be hired anyplace you choose. On Alphabet\u2019s side, it\u2019s an opportunity for the enterprise to be less whimsical and focus on what works, like expanding Google Cloud and Services.\n\nUnsurprisingly, analysts peg GOOG a strong buy with a $163.57 average price target. With its vast relevancies, Alphabet is one of the tech stocks to buy.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) icon displayed on smartphone with keyboard background. is an American multinational financial technology company operating an online payment\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn enterprise that saw so much promise during the early years of the Covid-19 crisis, digital payments processor and business services provider PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) hasn\u2019t been the same since late 2021. Last year, the company demonstrated some evidence of stability but the market eventually submerged shares into red ink. So, the subsequent pink slips weren\u2019t surprising.\n\nAt the end of last month, CNBC reported that PayPal will cut 9% of its global workforce. This unfortunate circumstance translates to about 2,500 jobs to be removed. While the company posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 14.2% \u2013 beating out 70% of its peers \u2013 recent sales expansion has slowed. Thus, the revenue multiple of 2.68X arguably could be better.\n\nStill, with the workforce reductions, management can focus on compelling business units. Further, it could be more competitive in cutthroat areas such as buy now, pay later (BNPL). Despite the many hiccups, analysts rate PYPL as a consensus moderate buy with a $67.61 target. Also, the high-side estimate lands at $85, making PayPal one of the tech stocks to buy.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to tech stocks to buy, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) represents a steady-as-she-goes investment. Prior to its big investments in AI player OpenAI becoming a well-known piece of information, Microsoft made its name in software and later video games. Sure enough, with the popularity of its Xbox console, the tech giant reaped the rewards. Still, I suppose it\u2019s possible to have too much of a good thing.\n\nLate last month, the company\u2019s leadership team announced job cuts amounting to around 9% of its gaming unit. The disclosure came a little more than three months after Microsoft closed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard; therefore, the cuts weren\u2019t surprising. At the time, management characterized the reductions as part of an \u201cexecution plan\u2019 that would reduce \u201careas of overlap.\u201d\n\nOver time, the move could prove beneficial. Of course, gaming remains popular, with the market\u2019s value reaching $217.06 billion in 2022. Further, analysts project a CAGR expansion of 13.4% to 2030. Still, other sectors like AI feature a much bigger growth rate.\n\nAnalysts like the decision to downsize, rating shares a consensus strong buy with a $469.45 price target.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) reached tremendous popularity through its ride-sharing and eventually food-delivery apps, it has struggled to achieve consistent profitability. In 2023, net income landed at $1.89 billion, a welcome change of pace from the prior four years of losses. Still, the company needs to keep the momentum going to succeed in the current tricky economic environment.\n\nAs a result, it wasn\u2019t that much of a shocker to see Uber laying off more than 150 workers recently. This directive stemmed from the company\u2019s dissolution of alcohol delivery service Drizly. In October 2021, Uber completed the acquisition of the delivery service. Back then, the buyout made sense given the unique nature of the pandemic. However, with society fully normalized, the service is less relevant.\n\nMoving forward, Uber can focus on what works \u2013 ride-sharing and food deliveries. A more focused approach should help sustain investor support, which has been robust over the past year. Analysts peg shares a consensus strong buy with a $78.65 price target. Further, the high-side estimate lands at $90, making it a solid choice for tech stocks to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the e-commerce giant that has dominated so many other areas of business, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) represents a clutch hitter among tech stocks to buy. Yes, the enterprise attracted serious controversies over the years. However, as an investment, it\u2019s tough to argue against it. AMZN stock printed a strong recovery effort in 2023 following volatility in 2022. Still, management couldn\u2019t avoid layoffs this year.\n\nA few days ago, the company reported that it would be cutting hundreds of jobs at its Amazon Pharmacy and One Medical divisions. The leadership team expressed the need to realign some resources to help accelerate efforts for patients and customers. Sadly, this directive comes with a steep human cost.\n\nNevertheless, an argument exists that a company could become too big and clunky. Streamlining its myriad businesses should help identify what works and what doesn\u2019t. Financially, Amazon prints a robust 13.1% three-year revenue growth rate so I\u2019m confident it can find its efficiencies quickly.\n\nAnalysts also share the same confidence, rating AMZN a unanimous strong buy with a $207.92 target.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logo\n\nSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.com\n\nOkay, before you send me an email, I fully realize that General Motors (NYSE:GM) is not one of the tech stocks to buy. But an irony exists here that I couldn\u2019t ignore. In December last year, CNBC reported that the automaker will lay off 900 employees or 24% of the workforce of robotaxi subsidiary Cruise.\n\nAs you know, autonomous driving platforms present great promise. However, many people remain leery about them. That situation came to a head in October when a woman was found critically injured and trapped underneath one of Cruise\u2019s self-driving vehicles. As I pointed out, context matters. Still, with so much negative attention directed against General Motors, it probably had no other course of action.\n\nStated differently, GM\u2019s path to success is to not be one of the tech stocks to buy. Instead, it should focus on its core automotive pursuits.\n\nI don\u2019t doubt that GM will continue to innovate in the driverless space. But for now, focusing on main business drivers could be profitable. Analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $48.12 average price target.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "5 Lucrative PEG-Based Value Stocks for Investors",
        "content": "In a market dealing with external shocks, value investing is fast gaining popularity. The success of value investors like Warren Buffett underscores this. Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, managed to register more than 20% CAGR for Berkshire Hathaway from 1965 through 2022. This compares favorably with a 10% rise of the S&P 500 Index during the same period.\n\nSeveral stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, have shown the overwhelming success of this pure-play investment strategy. Here, we discuss five such stocks \u2014 Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, General Motors Company GM, American Airlines AAL, Synchrony Financial SYF and Textron Inc. TXT.\n\nMore on Value Investing\n\nWhile searching for a suitable investment option, value investors with a varied risk appetite are unlikely to consider the price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio among several other popular metrics like price/earnings (P/E), price/sales and price/book value (P/B).\n\nThis is because they often find this ratio complicated, considering the limitations in calculating a stock's future earnings growth potential. Yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, are commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount.\n\nHowever, while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock, these ratios might end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show. This might often lead to \u201cvalue traps\u201d \u2014 a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once pulled down the share price, turn out to be persistent.\n\nIn such a case, even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value, you might still end up paying more. And here comes the importance of this not-so-popular but crucial value investing metric, the PEG ratio.\n\nThe PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth Rate\n\nA low PEG ratio is always better for value investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock.\n\nThere are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio. It doesn\u2019t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term.\n\nHence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.\n\nHere are some of the screening criteria for a winning strategy:\n\nPEG Ratio less than X Industry Median\n\nP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (for more accurate valuation purpose)\n\nZacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1\u00a0or 2 have a proven history of success.)\n\nMarket Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)\n\nAverage 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000 (A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.)\n\nPercentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5% (Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.)\n\nValue Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential.\n\nHere are five out of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nRoyal Caribbean: Based in Miami, Royal Caribbean is a cruise company. It owns and operates three global brands \u2014 Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises. Additionally, it has a 50% investment in a joint venture with TUI AG, which operates the brand TUI Cruises. The company\u2019s cruise brands primarily serve the contemporary, premium and deluxe segments of the cruise vacation industry, which also includes the budget and luxury segments.\n\nRoyal Caribbean currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Value Score of A. Royal Caribbean also has an impressive five-year expected growth rate of 26.7%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nGeneral Motors: It held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16.2% in 2023.

        "title": "The Slowdown Is Forcing EV Makers To Tweak Their Concepts",
        "content": "The pickup king, Ford Motor (NYSE: F), is considering a shift in EV strategy as even the electric version of its best-selling pickup, F-150 wasn\u2019t enough to fuel Ford into the electric future. Although Ford topped estimates with its fourth quarter results and guided for a strong year ahead, its EV losses worsened and the legacy automaker is scaling back its EV efforts.\n\nEarlier in January, Stellantis N.V. (NYSE: STLA) CEO warned of an EV bloodbath as Ford lowered its F-150 outlook in response to weaker sales. Stellantis boss warned that cutting EV prices too fast and on models where they make little money is a race to the bottom and one that Stellantis is trying to avoid. Although the EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) fueled demand by cutting prices multiple times, the price war it ignited also brutally harmed its profitability last year. Even Tesla admitted challenges in ramping up the production of its Cybertruck. Like General Motors (NYSE: GM), even Tesla paused some of its EV expansion plans. Moreover, Tesla clearly showed it is expecting significantly lower growth this year compared to 2023 with its annual outlook.\n\nAlthough records are being set on the EV front, the slowdown is real.\n\nMeanwhile, a pickup accessory maker, Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP), just announced it completed the production of first 1,100 AL3PRO hard folding covers that are compatible with trucks made by Ford, as well as by General Motors, Stellantis, Nissan Motor Co Ltd (OTC: NSANY) and Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM).\n\nWorksport delivered on its \u201cMade In The USA\u201d tonneau cover promise.\n\nToday, Worksport announced it has completed production of the first 1,1000 of its new all-aluminum hard folding covers made from more than 90% domestically sourced materials and produced at its state-of-art West Seneca, NY manufacturing facility. The AL3PRO hard folding tonneau covers are compatible with RAM trucks from Stellantis, GMC and Chevrolet branded vehicles owned by General Motors, Jeep from Stellantis, along with Nissan and Toyota pickups. Worksport also announced that the AL3PRO cover will soon be compatible with the widely popular Ridgeline from Honda Motor Co Ltd (NYSE: HMC). This robust, user-friendly, easy to install and functional aluminum construction with a modern design that promises to be durable and long-lasting is available on Worksport's e-commerce site. Worksport also plans to sell these covers also on Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) and eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY) is it continues to expand its B2B dealer network.\n\nStory continues\n\nWorksport continues to diligently work on its innovative clean energy promise\n\nWorksport\u2019s mission is built upon its belief that clean energy will be powering the future of the industry as it aims to create innovative truck accessories powered by off-grid energy solutions. Worksport is diligently working on the SOLIS solar-powered cover and the COR portable battery system. This powerful clean energy duo promises power on-the-go in the form of a mobile microgrid with initial quality testing for the COR already showing positive results. Worksport is pleased with its progress and announced it will be soon providing updates on these revolutionary products that promise off-grid power.\n\nThe EV concept needs to evolve.\n\nTherefore, although the EV slowdown is real, so are the evolutionary inventions that are well underway. Although hybrids might come to Ford\u2019s rescue, there is no going back as the ultimate aim is to get to a future powered by clean energy. But, the EV front is in for some tweaking as automakers, Tesla included, now need to start making EVs for everyone as opposed to focusing only on early adopters and the wealthy.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "12 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks To Buy Now",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best autonomous driving stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our overview of autonomous driving and how it's one of the most important sectors today especially when we consider the hype surrounding artificial intelligence, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThe biggest trend in the stock market these days is artificial intelligence. While data science has been an industry for years, artificial intelligence has come to the public's attention only because of OpenAI's massive success with ChatGPT. Before ChatGPT became available for public use, data science was primarily used in industrial cases such as supply chain management, drug and vaccine development, fraud detection, and others.\n\nAnother application that relies heavily on data science is autonomous driving. Autonomous driving is the technology that relies on a computer to aid a driver while they're on the road, and the industry has been able to progress quite a bit over the past couple of years. In fact, the same drivers of the A.I. wave, i.e. semiconductors designed and sold by firms such as NVIDIA Corporation and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), are also behind the rapid progress of autonomous driving systems.\n\nThese systems are made by public and private companies, and the former are traded on the stock markets as autonomous driving stocks. Autonomous driving stocks are those companies whose hardware or software is present in autonomous driving systems, or whose business operations are indispensable to the functioning of the autonomous driving industry. The potential of car makers to continuously gather data from every vehicle as it is being driven and then use this data to train algorithms that are capable of making driving decisions on their own has proven to be quite beneficial to autonomous driving stocks.\n\nIn fact, the world's most valuable car maker in terms of market capitalization, the Austin, Texas based electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) owes, some, if not most, of its market value to the simple fact that the firm's first principles driven approach led by its chief Elon Musk has enabled it to also operate as a technology company. This has made Tesla the world's most valuable autonomous driving stock, and the firm's massive market capitalization of $588 billion is based on its production systems and the massive amounts of data it has at its disposal to train its autonomous driving product, the Tesla Full Self Driving (FSD) platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, while Tesla's FSD continues to remain functional and operational despite the daily dose of controversy surrounding it, 2024 has also seen some other autonomous driving stocks struggle. One such autonomous driving stock is General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), whose Cruise autonomous driving system underwent a tragic accident in October last year that led California to pull its permits. Since then, a crucial GM update provided in January 2024 has created uncertainty about Cruise's future, and some quarters worry whether it will be able to regain compliance by the end of this year, especially after having laid off 25% of its workforce.\n\nSince Tesla's FSD is in a world of its own, its rivals such as GM compete with each other. Another mega cap stock that is also an autonomous driving stock is none other than the consumer technology behemoth Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Now structured as a holding company that makes money from or funds the losses of a variety of lucrative business, one such Alphabet division is Waymo. When it comes to California, Waymoe and Cruise account for 99% of the test driving miles in 2023. And now, as Cruise's future becomes uncertain, Waymo has the 'road clear' when it comes to develop autonomous driving technologies.\n\nAs for Cruise, here is what General Motors had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:\n\nOur plan 2024 investment in Cruise reflects our more deliberate and cadence go-to-market strategy and we are developing new financial targets and a new roadmap. Spending will be down considerably this year, but we will continue to invest in the people who are advancing the software, specialized hardware, and AI capabilities. This reflects our commitment to our vision, which is to deliver the safety benefits of self-driving technology and a scalable, profitable business. I look forward to sharing our timetable for returning Cruise EVs to the road soon. To summarize, we learned a lot in 2023, and those learnings are helping us build our strengths and addressing our challenges. Everyone on the team is committed to building on our momentum and creating shareholding value.\n\nYou\u2019ll see in our proxy statement this spring, executive compensation is tied even more closely to delivering our comprehensive ICE, EV, AV, and software plans, while meeting our financial targets. So our goals are truly aligned with yours. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I would like to share some thoughts about our next Investor Day. Because of the significant changes that are underway at GM and Cruise, we think it makes sense to wait until later in the year to host an event. This will give our software team the time to focus on software for our upcoming launches, and we will be able to share more tangible proof points on all four pillars of our strategy, ICE, EV, AV, and software. When we do get together, we will show you what we\u2019ve done, not just tell you what we\u2019re going to do.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the best autonomous driving stocks to buy. Some top autonomous driving stocks are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 12 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks To Buy Now\n\nAn auto warehouse filled with newly acquired used cars.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy, we ranked the top 20 autonomous driving stock holdings of the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q3 2023.

        "title": "PACCAR Inc. (PCAR) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Paccar (PCAR)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 12.7% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $106.41 in the previous session. Paccar has gained 8.6% since the start of the year compared to the -8.3% move for the Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector and the -19.3% return for the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on January 23, 2024, Paccar reported EPS of $2.7 versus consensus estimate of $2.2 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4.91%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Paccar is expected to post earnings of $7.96 per share on $31.65 billion in revenues. This represents a -17.17% change in EPS on a -5.01% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.86 per share on $34.31 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 11.26% and 8.42%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nPaccar may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nPaccar has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 13.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 13.3X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 9.3X versus its peer group's average of 7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.7. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Paccar currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Paccar passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Paccar shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.\n\nHow Does PCAR Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of PCAR have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is General Motors Company (GM). GM has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of C, and a Momentum Score of C.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. General Motors Company beat our consensus estimate by 10.71%, and for the current fiscal year, GM is expected to post earnings of $8.83 per share on revenue of $175.3 billion.\n\nShares of General Motors Company have gained 11.4% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 4.45X and a P/CF of 2.01X.\n\nThe Automotive - Domestic industry may rank in the bottom 63% of all the industries we have in our universe, but there still looks like there are some nice tailwinds for PCAR and GM, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "RIVN Stock Outlook: Should You Buy the Dip on Rivian?",
        "content": "While the fall of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been the Electric Vehicle (EV) story in 2024, its smaller rival Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) has done worse. This performance is central to this RIVN stock outlook.\n\nRivian shares are down almost 29% since 2024 started, against a 22% fall in Tesla.\n\nRivian is due to report earnings on February 21, after delivering 13,972 cars and trucks in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s short of the 15,564 delivered in the third quarter but may be a harbinger of good news. Rivian has been losing money on every vehicle it makes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBang the Drum Slowly\n\nDespite its losses, analysts spent most of last year pounding the table for Rivian. There are still some things going for it.\n\nFirst is the 100,000 van order from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which retains a minority stake in the stock. Second is Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, who put $1.5 billion of taxpayer money into the company to secure its second manufacturing plant.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Georgia plant itself, which will make a new line called the R2, priced at around $40,000. There will also be some tweaks to the current models, which could help increase sales. Car & Driver calls the R1 \u201cone of the most capable EVs ever.\u201d\n\nBut the brokers have been banging the drum more slowly lately. Two recently lowered their price targets on the stock, although Needham and Barclays (NYSE:BCS) maintained buy ratings. Rivian has been conducting layoffs, while lifting production forecasts.\n\nCan Rivian Be Saved?\n\nThe problem is that, like many other EV companies, Rivian is in a race between its losses and its cash. The R2 line isn\u2019t due until 2026, and meanwhile, the whole EV complex is hurting. Chinese companies like BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) stand ready to sell EVs for just $25,000. All that has hit Rivian\u2019s stock price hard since the start of the year.\n\nRivian is down only 11% over the last full year, and it still had nearly $8 billion in cash at the end of the third quarter. The third quarter report shows it cutting its cash burn rate, but operating cash flow still averages negative $1.3 billion. The company has been staying afloat by buying debt. The debt load was up to $5.9 billion in September.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the present rate, it seems Rivian will run out of cash runway before the Georgia plant is completed unless it sells more stock. That will water down current shareholders. The next year should also see several small EV companies collapse. General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) are pulling back, reducing competition. This is an important part of the RIVN stock outlook.\n\nSo far, Wall Street remains on Rivian\u2019s side. Of 14 analysts following the stock at Tipranks, 8 are still telling clients to buy. One even had a price target of $36 on the stock. Small investors, measured at Stocktwits, also remain optimistic.  As more consumers look to boycott Tesla, they might want to look at what Rivian has to offer.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI was somewhat optimistic when Rivian came public. I\u2019m less so now.\n\nThis is a highly speculative play. The Chinese are coming and scaring even better-capitalized companies. Tesla is still producing a massive number of cars and dropping prices. Rivian can\u2019t scale much beyond the current level, and it faces a cash crunch. Now Ford says it will meet that $25,000 BYD EV price through a \u201cskunk works\u201d it has had operating for two years.\n\nDespite what oil lovers tell you, the EV transition is happening. By their nature, EVs are cheap and simple machines. Electric motors can scale from powering bikes and scooters to trains and planes, and the design is always the same.\n\nIf Rivian can get to 2026 intact, it has a chance. Care to place a bet on that? I don\u2019t, but if I were 30 years younger, I\u2019d consider it. This concludes my RIVN stock outlook.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in AMZN.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

        "title": "20 Best Electric Cars of 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will go over the 20 best electric cars of 2024. If you want to skip our discussion about the EV industry, head over to the 7 Best Electric Cars of 2024.\n\nThe global electric vehicle market is growing at an extraordinary rate. It was valued at $384.56 billion in 2022, but it is expected to reach a whopping $1.57 trillion by 2030. The compounding annual growth rate (CAGR) during this forecast period is estimated to be 22.1%. Consumers' preference for environmentally friendly fuel and rising gas prices are two of the key driving factors for this impressive growth rate. It is also worth noting that Asia Pacific is the highest growth region for electric vehicles, and China has the largest market.\n\nIt is widely believed that EVs are more environmentally friendly compared to regular vehicles. They are more efficient at utilizing energy and have a significantly lesser carbon footprint. So, governments and organizations, around the world, are attempting to promote electric vehicles. For Instance, On April 12, 2023, the Environment Protection Agency announced a new set of federal vehicle emission standards aimed at speeding the sustainable transportation transition, which will reduce carbon dioxide by 10 billion tons. These standards will also enable the United States to eventually achieve independence from oil. However, despite this, exorbitant prices are discouraging customers from buying electric vehicles. It seems that EV companies are still charging customers the research and development costs that went into developing the technology. For perspective, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Model X Plaid starts at $119,990.\n\nThe good news for consumers is that prices of EVs might drop soon as competition and production process efficiency increase. Interestingly, some technological breakthroughs meant to improve the convenience of electric cars may also help bring the costs down. One such technological advancement is the introduction of solid-state batteries, which may prove to be game changers in the EV industry. These batteries have greater energy storage density, which means that a similar-sized solid-state battery will give more mileage than an ordinary battery. In addition, they also charge much faster, which is a blessing for EV users. Solid-state batteries also have a reduced environmental impact compared to traditional batteries.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, these batteries are also quite cost-effective. A significant portion of the money that users spend on buying an electric vehicle is spent on batteries, so solid-state batteries will help tame the prices in the future. Government incentives for purchasing an electric car, such as the federal government's  tax credit of up to $7,500 for new vehicles purchased after 2023, also reduce the cost of owning it.\n\nIt is worth noting that solid-state batteries have only recently gone into mass production. Some renowned companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have not yet moved to solid-state technologies. The company has invested heavily in its current battery technology in the form of Gigafactories. These factories are designed to produce lithium-ion batteries at an unprecedented scale. So, shifting to solid-state batteries would require substantial retooling and reengineering of these facilities, which would not only be costly but also time-consuming.\n\nMeanwhile, some companies are focused on producing affordable electric vehicles. One such company is General Motors Company (NYSE:GM). Its Chevrolet Bolt EV is one of the most affordable EVs in the market. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)'s Chevrolet Bolt is also one of the most popular electric vehicles and has an impressive range considering its price. The retail price of this car starts at around $26,500. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)'s Chevrolet Bolt has a 200 hp electric motor and a front-wheel drive.\n\nOne of the questions that people ask before buying electric vehicles is this: what is the charging infrastructure like? The answer to this question is that the United States has one of the most extensive charging infrastructures in the world, and it is improving at an unprecedented rate. According to IEA, the United States installed 6,300 fast chargers in 2022. Two-thirds of these were Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Superchargers. The total stock of these fast chargers reached 28,000 by the year-end 2022. In addition, the Biden-Harris administration announced a plan last year to build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at some of the best electric cars of 2024.  20 Best Electric Cars of 2024\n\nImage by Mikes-Photography from Pixabay\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of 20 best electric cars of 2024, we used three (1,2,3) sources.

        "content": "Auto stocks, particularly EV-based sales, have faced hardships industry-wide. Though EVs are more popular than ever before, profits have slowed compared to the continuous surge experienced in previous years.\n\nHowever, these three stock picks are starting this year with impressive dedication and promise to their efforts in EV production. These companies are rising above the competition by adding needed diversification in many aspects of their internal operations and dedicating more and more to EV production.\n\nWe\u2019ll detail how and where these companies put in the extra attention and funds to revive their EV sales and why now is a better time to capitalize before these stocks take off.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nToyota (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nToyota (NYSE:TM) is a worldwide motor vehicle industry giant and has never shied away from the fierce competition within the EV sector. Last year, Toyota faced some setbacks, losing a partnership with General Motors (NYSE:GM), but has not given up on revamping their EVs like never seen before.\n\nDespite setbacks, Toyota has ensured its devoted attention to EV production, announcing new EV concepts to be realized in the EU market by 2026. Toyota has made similar announcements regarding its commitment to EVs in North America.\n\nToyota announced that it would be beginning production of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), the three-row SUV model in particular, in Kentucky in 2025. Along with this production is a massive $1.3 billion investment in the manufacturing plant in Kentucky to accelerate the implementation of solid-state batteries.\n\nSolid-state batteries are said to decrease charging times and increase the range for EVs while reducing production costs. Toyota expects full implementation between 2026 and 2028, and even the promise of advancement like this saw a rise in the Toyota stock last year.\n\nToyota has maintained solid net revenue and shows promising growth efforts in the EV sector. There is no better time to make a buy to capitalize on the expected price rise of this stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nFord (F) 2022 Ford (F stock) F-150 Lightning Lariat\n\nSource: Ford\n\nFord (NYSE:F) is another company in the motor vehicle industry with a long legacy (and brand) and a will to match the times with dedication to a massive EV division.\n\nFord ended up selling 72,608 EVs in 2023, 18% up from 2022 and a new record for the company.\n\nOn top of this, Ford saw a huge surge in hybrid vehicle sales in January, reaching over 40%, which shows great promise for the stock.\n\nFord will continue its efforts to assert itself as a top EV seller. One of the most notable changes Ford has made is the recent agreement from the end of last year with Pt Vale Indonesia and Huayou, detailing a nickel mining project in Indonesia that will boost Ford\u2019s supply chain production of sustainable batteries to fuel their popular EV models like their F series pickups.\n\nWhile Ford is slowing down the production of EVs to match demand, the limit could provide needed stability to the stock price. Accompanied by the boost in hybrid sales and continued dedication to sustainable supply chain operations, this stock could be an excellent buy for a safe return with lower volatility.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors is another big name in motor vehicles but faced some unfortunate setbacks towards the end of last year. After a United Auto Workers strike in December, the company lost operating profit for 2023 by a little over $1 billion.\n\nIn addition, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported an investigation it was conducting into one of GM\u2019s hybrid models in December. However, GM has come out with a solid initiative to retake their earnings and reputation in EVs in 2024.\n\nThis initiative starts with a monumental hire of former Tesla battery development head Kurt Kelty. GM announced Mr. Kelty\u2019s onboarding and revealed his sole purpose of utilizing GM\u2019s available resources to bring new life to their EV division through lower-cost, profitable, quality EVs.\n\nGM overcame these setbacks with a minimal drop in market share in Q4 of 2023 while sales remained steady. Amidst its efforts to improve its EV division, GM came out of Q4 with a 7.8% bounce and expected earnings per share of $8.50-$9.50 for the year after adjustment.\n\nYou can take advantage of the expected growth in GM\u2019s EV division and their current settled trading price to see some great profits for the upcoming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Lim is a finance freelance writer who writes content for several companies like LTSE and Realtor, along with financial publications, including Mises Institute and Foundation for Economic Education.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "GM\u2019s (GM) Chevrolet finally offered up more details on pricing for its upcoming Equinox EV\u2014and it will indeed target the lower end of the market, which has had very few offerings.\n\nIn the fall GM said the entry level Equinox EV would sell for about $35,000, now Chevrolet has confirmed that dealer ordering is expected to start soon, Chevy says the entry level Equinox EV in 1LT FWD (front wheel drive) trim will start at $34,995, with availability in the fall. Destination fees: an additional $1,395, however.\n\nGM also said it expects the Equinox EV to have an EPA 319 miles of range (FWD), which is a considerable figure when compared to other cheaper EV offerings like the Nissan Leaf (XX) and Chevy\u2019s other stablemate, the now discontinued Bolt. New and affordable: Chevrolet's new model Chevrolet Equinox EV. (Photo: Jacek Boczarski/Anadolu via Getty Images) (Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nFull trim levels and pricing for the Equinox EV will be as follows, not including destination charges:\n\n1LT FWD starting at $34,995 (available later in 2024) 2LT FWD starting at $43,295 2RS FWD starting at $44,795 3LT FWD starting at $45,295 3RS FWD starting at $46,795\n\nThe fully loaded 3RS is priced at a reasonable $46.800. But it\u2019s the base model starting at below $35k that\u2019s very compelling in a market with slim offerings in the entry level EV space. Plus, GM has confirmed the the Equinox EV does qualify for the federal EV tax credit of $7,500, meaning it could be had for as little as $27,495, not including destination, and with the possibility of layering on additional state EV tax incentives. A bargain: the Chevrolet Equinox EV. (Photo: Jacek Boczarski/Anadolu via Getty Images) (Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nThe big question? How much money iwill GM make (or not make) on the Equinox. GM has said it intends to achieve low, single-digit profitability [EBIT EV margin] in 2025\u2014and that leveraging its Ultium battery platform across all its EV models will help lower costs.\n\nGM is also pursuing a different strategy than its rival Ford. GM intends to offer EVs in the entry level, midsize, truck, and luxury crossover and SUV product categories. Ford (F) CEO Jim Farley revealed, following the company's latest earnings report, that it intends to only pursue the lower end of the EV market with a cheaper, Gen-2 EV, and the higher end with trucks and full size vans. That means it will abandon the middle of the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla is also aiming to have a cheaper next-gen offering, reportedly targeting a $27,000 entry level EV, that will debut in 2025.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks for Value Investors",
        "content": "Value investors actively look for stocks that they think the market has undervalued. It is their belief that the market overreacts to good and bad news, which results in stock price movements that do not correspond with a company's long-term fundamentals. This, according to them, creates an opportunity to profit when the price of the stock goes down. Value investors turn to financial ratios to help analyze a company's fundamentals.\n\nThe price-to-book (P/B) ratio is widely favored by value investors for identifying low-priced stocks with exceptional returns. The ratio is used to compare a stock\u2019s market value/price to its book value.\n\nThe P/B ratio is calculated as below:\n\nP/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per share\n\nThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company GM, Cemex CX, Centene CNC, Enersys ENS and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft DB are some such stocks.\n\nNow, let us understand the concept of book value.\n\nWhat is Book Value?\n\nThere are several ways by which book value can be defined.\u00a0Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company\u2019s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.\n\nIt is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders\u2019 equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company\u2019s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.\n\nUnderstanding P/B Ratio\n\nBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.\n\nA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.\n\nBut there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock\u2019s price may be significantly high \u2014 thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one \u2014 in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.\n\nMoreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.\n\nIn any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.\n\nPrice to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company\u2019s sales/revenues \u2014 a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.\n\nPrice to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share \u2014 a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.\n\nPEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.\n\nCurrent Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\n\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\n\nValue Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.\n\nHere are five of the 10 picks that qualified the screening:\n\nHeadquartered in Detroit,\u00a0General Motors is one of the world\u2019s largest automakers.

        "content": "Lithium stocks have been a disaster with oversupply issues and a drop-off in demand for electric vehicles. But with prices this cheap, it may be time to get greedy with lithium stocks with millionaire potential. Especially if the Federal Reserve does cut rates.\n\nRight now,\u00a0interest rates are at a 22-year high of 5.4%,\u00a0driving up borrowing costs.\u00a0It\u2019s a big part of why electric vehicle sales are slowing. It\u2019s also why auto companies like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F) are delaying electric vehicle rollouts.\n\nHowever, once the Federal Reserve does start cutting those rates, pent-up demand for such things should return. And with it, we should see higher lithium prices.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn addition,\u00a0as I noted on Jan. 21, \u201cWith some lithium mines shutting down or reducing production we could see less supply. This could help stabilize prices and send lithium prices higher with demand.\u201d\n\nThat said, you may want to be well-positioned in lithium stocks with millionaire potential.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter plunging from a high of about $331 to a low of $114.33, the industry\u2019s weakened 800 lb. gorilla, Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is showing some signs of life. Plus, at 4x earnings, with a yield of 1.39%, you can get paid to wait for this cheap stock to recover.\n\nTo help, the company is\u00a0reducing costs by $95 million a year by cutting expenses and its workforce. According to a press release, the company will focus on permitting at the Kings Mountain spodumene resource and postpone spending.\n\nBetter, analysts at\u00a0RBC Capital are maintaining a buy rating on ALB, with a price target of $140. Also, it may not seem like it at the moment, but ALB is one of the top lithium stocks with millionaire potential.\n\nArcadium Lithium (ALTM) a lithium mine, ATLX stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThere\u2019s also\u00a0Arcadium Lithium (NYSE:ALTM), the $4.94 billion company that combined Allkem and Livent to create one of the biggest lithium companies in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s another cheap stock trading at $4.60, at 5x earnings, and with a price to earnings growth ratio of just 0.33. Helping,\u00a0Loop Capital is maintaining a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $9.\n\nArcadium Lithium is one of the largest global producers of lithium chemicals, with $1.9 billion in revenue and over 2,600 employees in 2022, according to the company website.\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) Lithium element on the periodic table.

At $40 a share, it\u2019s trading a 1.24x sales, which is far less than its five-year average of 4.54.\n\nAnd, as expected, earnings haven\u2019t been great. In its most recent quarter,\u00a0SQM said revenue slipped 38% YOY to $1.84 billion. Net income came in 56% lower year over year to $479.9 million, as EPS crumbled 56% to $1.68 year over year. However, it does appear that a good amount of negativity has been priced in.\n\nNow, while we wait for lithium and SQM to recover, we can collect its dividend yield.\n\nPiedmont Lithium (PLL) Person holding cellphone with logo of US mining company Piedmont Lithium Inc.

        "title": "SoFi\u2019s Rollercoaster Ride: Should You Jump on Board SOFI Stock Now?",
        "content": "Like many reporters and analysts my SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock forecast has been steadily bullish since the fintech went public in 2021. It closed that day at $22.65. It opened February 8 at $7.67. I was among those who \u201cbought the dip\u201d in the mid-teens.\n\nBut the question for today is whether you should buy SoFi, today, at its current price? Will it make a young investor some money? Can it come good? Yes it can. Although it depends on what you mean by good.\n\nA SoFi Stock Forecast: What Went Wrong\n\nMostly, SoFi is a consumer bank. It buys money as deposits. It sells money as consumer loans.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis is not a sexy business, although it can be profitable. Wall Street doesn\u2019t place a high value on it. DAVE (NASDAQ:DAVE), a digital bank that started off with even higher hopes than SoFi, is now a penny stock with a market cap of $266 million.\n\nAlly Financial (NASDAQ:ALLY), the General Motors (NYSE:GM) consumer banking spinoff, has been mostly spinning its wheels for a decade and a half. Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), the General Electric (NYSE:GE) banking spin-off, has barely moved in five years.\n\nOf course, SoFi promised to be much more than a consumer bank. It offers brokerage services, it wholesales its capabilities through software, and you can even get crypto. But most of its money today still comes from lending.\n\nBanks have lost their former greatness. The iShares Regional Bank ETF (NYSEARCA:IAT) now costs less than it did five years ago. The entire banking sector is losing ground in lending to private equity, which doesn\u2019t carry its heavy regulation, because it doesn\u2019t have to protect the depositors\u2019 money.\n\nThis is why professional analysts are souring on SoFi. Tipranks has 16 following it, evenly divided between buyers and sellers. The average price target is just over $9. They\u2019re not expecting much.\n\nBut maybe that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nA Look at the Numbers\n\nNow let\u2019s look at what SoFi did in 2023 to justify its $7.6 billion market cap. For all of 2023 SoFi lost $94 million, 10 cents per share, on revenue of $2.1 billion. It did show a profit of $24.6 million, 2 cents per share, in the fourth quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe good news is SoFi lending had a net interest margin of 6.02%. It generated Earnings Before Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $181 million, and the EBITDA margin was 30%, in line with CEO Anthony Noto\u2019s targets.\n\nSoFi now has 7.5 million account holders, and 145 million users on its technology platform. That platform includes its wholesale banking services, sold through Galileo and Technisys. But the number of people on the technology platform grew just 11%, and revenue was up just 12%.\n\nThe report did have some good numbers in it. Personal loan volume was up 41% on the year. Net interest income was up 81%. Total revenue in the financial services segment jumped 160%. There are indications that the \u201cflywheel\u201d of earnings is starting to work.\n\nFor 2024 SoFi is anticipating net revenue of at least $550 million and positive net income of $10-20 million. It expects lending revenue to nearly double thanks to the technology and financial service platforms. Two years from now, SoFi is projecting GAAP earnings of 55-80 cents/share.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSoFi\u2019s decision to become a bank, to take deposits and to be regulated as a bank, saved it during the tech wreck of 2022, but it does limit its growth prospects according to my SoFi stock forecast.\n\nIf SoFi can get earnings to 80 cents, a price to earnings ratio in the mid-teens leaves you with a $12 stock. That\u2019s not a go-go tech number. That\u2019s a nice, safe bank number.\n\nA young investor building a portfolio should thus consider SoFi ballast. It won\u2019t be a home run, but it could hit singles and doubles for years to come. That\u2019s not what was promised at the IPO, but it\u2019s a lot better than what other SPACs have done.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in SOFI.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

        "title": "Inflation, retail sales, and corporate earnings: What to know this week",
        "content": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed above 5,000 for the first time ever on Friday as the three major averages logged a positive week for the 13th time in the last 14 weeks.\n\nWith few economic catalysts in the past week, investors have been digesting a slew of corporate results that have come in better than expected. Meanwhile, commentary from Federal Reserve officials largely reiterated the central bank's stance that more confidence in inflation's path downward is needed.\n\nThe week ahead will bring new challenges to the market rally, though, with a fresh reading on inflation and consumer spending highlighting the economic calendar. On the corporate side, about 15% of the S&P 500 is set to report earnings headlined by John Deere (DE), Coinbase (COIN), Airbnb (ABNB), and Shopify (SHOP).\n\nPrice check\n\nTuesday morning will bring investors the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January. Wall Street expects an annual gain of 2.9% for headline CPI, which includes the price of food and energy, a noted decrease from the 3.4% headline number in December. Prices are set to rise 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, in line with December's rise.\n\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out the food and energy prices, inflation is expected have risen 3.7% year-over-year, a slowdown from the 3.9% increase seen in December. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, unchanged from the month prior.\n\n\"We expect more core goods deflation this month, mainly driven by weak used car prices,\" Morgan Stanley economist Diego Anzoategui wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. \"Gradual deceleration is confirmed, but services inflation remains sticky with some deceleration in rents inflation but a slight rebound in insurance prices and hotels.\"\n\nState of the consumer\n\nPart of the soft-landing thesis that's taken over markets in the past few months has been consistent stronger-than-expected data on consumer spending. A fresh reading on that trend is set to greet investors on Thursday with the January retail sales report. Economists expect retail sales declined 0.2% in January from the prior month.\n\nStory continues\n\nBank of America US economist Michael Gapen is anticipating a \"soft\" print due to seasonal factors and widespread winter storms that likely disrupted retail spending in January. But Gapen doesn't believe this changes the overall narrative for the consumer.\n\n\"Sifting out the noise, however, the consumer looks healthy, with upside risks to spending from accelerating real wages,\" Gapen wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe real wages metric Gapen references, which is the wage Americans see after subtracting headline inflation from their wage growth, was recently listed in the Yahoo Finance Chartbook as a reason the US economy has skirted recession amid higher interest rates.\n\nA final look at traditional autos\n\nAfter Tesla's (TSLA) earnings report disappointed investors, traditional automakers Ford (F) and GM (GM) surprised to the upside. Stellantis (STLA), the parent company of Chrysler and Fiat, is on deck to report Thursday, making it the last Big Three automaker to report earnings this cycle.\n\nYahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: While the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike that lingered into October will likely hit operating margins, Stellantis is expected to see revenue jump over 5% to 189.3 million euros, and adjusted net income to climb 9.7% year over year to 18.4 billion euros, per Bloomberg estimates.\n\nStellantis CEO Carlos Tavares was criticized in the past for not moving faster with the company\u2019s EV transition; now he is looking prescient as demand for EVs has seemingly waned in recent months. Shares of fellow Big Three automakers Ford and GM have surged following strong earnings reports, as the two Michigan-based automakers\u2019 traditional gas-powered businesses are projecting robust profits for 2024.\n\nInvestors will be looking for Stellantis to offer more of the same with an outlook that sees profit growth and limits EV capital expenditure outlays.\n\nEarnings breadth expands\n\nBroadly earnings have been coming in increasingly positive. With 75% of S&P 500 companies havingreported earnings, the benchmark index is on pace to report its second straight quarter of earnings growth. And, notably, analysts see earnings growth continuing throughout the next two years.\n\nIn a note to clients on Friday, Deutsche Bank chief equity strategist Binky Chadha highlighted that 83% of US companies are beating earnings estimates. Per Chadha's research, this is the highest mark in two years and \"well above the upper end of its pre-pandemic range.\" It's also significantly higher than the beat rates in other countries, which could be an indicator of why US stocks are outperforming other markets.\n\n\"Such elevated beats have historically been seen only in the early stages of recovery from major cyclical downturns,\" Chadha wrote.\n\nSeveral strategists recently noted a similar trend to Yahoo Finance when explaining how the S&P 500 could rise to new highs later this year without outsized contributions from a few large tech stocks that have been driving the market action as of late.\n\n\"As investors stop worrying so much about exactly when the Fed will start to cut rates, I think we'll see a lot of these companies outside of the Magnificent Seven have pretty strong earnings growth, and that will cause them to do pretty well in turn,\" Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance.\n\nWeekly calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations, January (3.01% previously)\n\nEarnings:Avis Budget Group (CAR), Monday.com (MNDY), Waste Management (WM), Zoominfo Technologies (ZI)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, January (91.9 previously) Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, January (+0.2% expected, +0.3% previously); Core CPI, month-over-month, January (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); CPI, year-over-year, January (+2.9% expected, +3.4% previously); Core CPI, year-over-year, January (+3.7% expected, +3.9% previously); Real average hourly earnings, year-over-year, January (+0.8% previously)\n\nEarnings: Airbnb (ABNB), AutoNation (AN), Biogen (BIIB), Coca-Cola (KO), Datadog (DDOG), Hasbro (HAS), Instacart (CART), Marriott International (MAR), Lyft (LYFT), MGM Resorts (MGM), Moody's (MCO), Robinhood (HOOD), Shopify (SHOP), Upstart (UPST), Zillow Group (ZG)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Feb. 9 (+3.7%)\n\nEarnings: Albermarle (ALB), Cisco (CSCO), CME Group (CME), Generac (GNRC), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Occidental (OXY), Sony (SONY), Sunoco (SUN), Twilio (TWLO)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Initial jobless claims, week ending Feb. 10 (218,000 previously); Retail sales, month-over-month, January (-0.2% expected, +0.6% previously); Retail sales ex auto and gas, January (+0.2% expected, +0.6% previously); Import prices, month-over-month, January (-0.1% expected, +0.0% previously); Export prices, month-over-month, January (-3.2% previously); Industrial production, month-over-month, January (+0.4% expected, +0.1% previously); NAHB housing market index, February (44 prior)\n\nEarnings:Applied Materials (AMAT), Coinbase (COIN), Crocs (CROX), DoorDash (DASH), DraftKings (DKNG), John Deere (DE), Penn National (PENN), Oatly (OTLY), Roku (ROKU), Stellantis (STLA), The Trade Desk (TTD), Toast (TOST), Wendy's (WEN), Yeti (YETI)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic data: Producer Price Index, month-over-month, January (+0.1% expected, -0.1% previously); PPI, year-over-year, January (+1% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, February preliminary (79.0 expected, 79.0 previously); Building permits month-over-month, January (1.5% expected, 1.8% previously)\n\nEarnings: Air Canda (ACDVF), Cinemark (CNK)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Why Mazda says hybrid crossover SUVs are the 'sweet spot' for the US market",
        "content": "Count Mazda (MZDAY) among the automakers who were criticized for dragging their feet into EVs, but the company is likely now glad it did.\n\nGlobally, for the first three quarters of its fiscal year, Mazda on Friday reported record earnings of 200.2 billion yen ($1.32 billion), up 83% year over year, with global sales volume up 17% to 930K units. The company is forecasting \u201crecord results for all profit levels\u201d when it reports fiscal full year results after the quarter ending on March 31.\n\nWhile Mazda does not currently offer a pure electric EV in the US (it killed off the MX-30 EV that was only sold in California), the Japanese automaker intends to be fully electrified by 2030 \u2014 meaning 75% hybrid and 25% pure electric vehicles.\n\nFor the time being a conservative approach from the relatively nimble Mazda in the US is working out, as evidenced by the company\u2019s best sales year in America since 1994. Mazda North America CEO Tom Donnelly said Mazda\u2019s transition plan was deliberate, even in the face of a shifting marketplace. The Mazda CX-70 crossover utility (Mazda) (Mazda)\n\n\u201cNo question it is a dynamic marketplace right now, but we've had a strategy all along that we call multi-solution, meaning all along our plans were around hybrids and plug-in hybrids and ultimately electrification,\u201d Donnelly said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\n\nDonnelly notes the Mazda plan is a three-phase approach, starting with its flagship CX-90 plug-in hybrid CUV (crossover utility vehicle) that debuted last year, the just-revealed CX-70 plug-in hybrid, and the CX-50 hybrid coming later this year.\n\nThose three vehicles will take Mazda through 2030 when the brand will feature exclusively electrified powertrains. \u201cWe think the pacing and our overall strategy is right for the market today,\u201d Donnelly said.\n\nThough the company may be performing well here based on its initial pure electric hesitance, Mazda has been criticized for moving too slowly toward electrification, and still may be too far behind other mass market players like GM, Ford, and even Toyota if electrification hits a tipping point in a few years' time.\n\nStory continues\n\nGM, Ford, and Toyota have pledged billions toward that transition, and though they may be delaying or curtailing some, the sheer scale of those investments dwarfs what Mazda can spend on battery and EV powertrain development. Late last year Mazda reiterated plans to spend $10.7 billion on electrification efforts through 2030, whereas Toyota intends to spend $37 billion in the same time period.\n\nDonnelly deflects the criticism, claiming that Mazda has been an \u201cintentional follower\u201d in the space, an interesting turn of phrase considering most companies want to be seen as \u201cleaders.\u201d The Mazda CX-90 crossover utility. (Mazda) (Mazda)\n\n\u201cWe want to time the market and ensure that we introduce products, technologies, powertrains that the market demands, and we're clearly seeing a slowdown in BEV adoption, [but] we're seeing acceleration in hybrid demand, and that's why we think the introduction of the two plugins that we have this year, as well as the hybrid and CX-50 later this year, we think we're timing the market right,\u201d he said.\n\nDonnelly believes the mix of crossover utility vehicles paired with hybrid powertrains is the \u201csweet spot\u201d for Mazda\u2019s customers, who he says are for the most part affluent empty nesters who appreciate Mazda vehicles' driving dynamics, which he says is Mazda\u2019s strength.\n\nIt\u2019s the thinking that the smaller, spunkier Mazda doesn\u2019t have to be all things to all people, like Toyota or GM. It\u2019s a playbook even Ford has turned to, getting rid of middling cars and focusing on trucks, SUVs, and sports cars like the Mustang: vehicles that speak to their core audience.\n\n\u201cWe had our best December ever in terms of retail sales, our best January ever in terms of retail sales,\u201d Donnelly said. \u201cWe think our strategy is right for today's marketplace and really for the next couple of years.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Auto File-The Big Cost Down",
        "content": "Feb 9 - Joe White Global Autos Correspondent Greetings from the Motor City! Happy Year of the Dragon! And a festive pre-Mardi Gras weekend! If you happen to be in Belgium on Tuesday, head for the Carnival in Binche. You won\u2019t be sorry. The auto industry, however, appears to be cutting past Fat Tuesday and Lunar New Year parades and bracing for a season of belt-tightening. That sound you hear in the background as auto CEOs conduct earnings season calls with analysts is the sharpening of knives (and pencils) for more cost-cutting. The pandemic price bubble is deflating, huge EV investments aren\u2019t paying off and China\u2019s economy is going sideways. There are new signs that U.S. consumers \u2013 for so long the wind beneath the industry\u2019s wings - are reaching the limits of the car loan debt they can carry. Tesla, Ford, GM \u2013 everyone\u2019s talking about cutting the fat. It's not 2008 all over again. But it\u2019s not 2019, either. We\u2019ll take stock of the uncertain environment, and lots more. Have a great weekend! Laissez les bon temps rouler! Today \u2013\n\n* Tesla\u2019s weight problem\n\n* The U.S. investigates Waymo\n\n* Nissan falls hard Tesla and the new season of austerity Elon Musk signaled to Tesla staffers this week that he\u2019s looking into why the electric vehicle company has 140,000 employees \u2013 31% more workers per dollar of revenue than General Motors. Tesla is structured differently from GM or Ford. Tesla produces more vehicle parts in house, it has energy and solar units, and it owns its dealer, service and charging networks. Legacy automakers outsourced sales and service to franchised dealers a century ago. Still \u2013 Tesla\u2019s overhead costs (SG&A) were up 24% in the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier. Revenue increased by just 3.5%. And Musk warned that Tesla does not expect significant growth this year. Those are all leading indicators for a retrenchment \u2013 which is part of the cycle for companies that make cars, including Tesla, which likes to present itself as a technology company. Speaking of technology companies, they are laying off staff by the thousands as they reassess the wisdom of pandemic-era hiring sprees. Legacy automakers are squeezing budgets too. The EV capital investment and technology arms race of the past five years has given way to more sober assessments of how much \u201cinnovation\u201d mainstream consumers are willing or able to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nFord, for example, dug into the data streaming from connected vehicles and discovered that almost nobody was using an automated parking system that helped execute a parallel parking maneuver. That feature is now off the menu, saving $60 per vehicle \u2013 which rolls up to $10 million a year, Ford COO Kumar Galhotra told analysts. A bigger austerity driver for Ford and GM are demands from investors that the Detroit automakers hand them more of the cash being spun up by their combustion truck franchises.\n\nFord on Tuesday obliged with an 18 cents a share special dividend \u2013 a move that helped send the stock up 10% since the start of the week. Gone are the days when automakers boasted about rising \u201cATPs\u201d \u2013 industry shorthand for average transaction prices. The industry is now bracing for prices to downshift. More U.S. consumers are defaulting on hefty car loans taken on during the pandemic years as car prices soared, the New York Fed reported. Read the NY Fed blog post on auto loan trouble here. In the fourth quarter, Tesla\u2019s average revenue per vehicle delivered fell by 18% to $44,505, reflecting the impact of a year of price cutting to keep volumes from contracting. Tesla\u2019s price chopping has had jolting knock-on effects for rival automakers, and big customers such as Hertz that relied on re-selling their used Tesla\u2019s at yesterday's higher prices. No Mardi Gras for the auto business. It\u2019s already Ash Wednesday in the World of Cars. Essential Reading\n\n* A pinch of salt could upend the EV industry\n\n* Paris triples parking fees for SUVs\n\n* Bad climate news will make it hot for automakers Has EV hesitation hit China? Sales of \u201cnew energy vehicles\u201d \u2013 EVs and hybrids \u2013 fell in China last month for the first time since last August. One month does not make for a reliable trend. The January slump could be payback for sales pulled in to December by automakers\u2019 sales promotions. China\u2019s economy overall is wobbly \u2013 prices are falling as consumers shut wallets. Still, China\u2019s NEV sector \u2013 which includes Tesla - can ill afford a slowdown in growth, given its excess capacity. Beijing is urging Chinese automakers to invest in production abroad to counter trade barriers \u2013 copying a page from the playbook Japanese and South Korean automakers used to respond to U.S. protectionism. That makes sense \u2013 but what happens to existing NEV factories in China if electrified vehicle growth stalls out? Now Waymo has an accident problem A Waymo robo-taxi clipped a cyclist in San Francisco. The cyclist apparently suffered only scratches and left the scene. Such minor incidents between human-driven cars and cyclists happen every day. But when a robot car is involved, it\u2019s a federal case. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating the incident. Waymo reported the incident on the same day that the top lawyer for General Motors, now doubling as caretaker at the Cruise robo-taxi unit, was apologizing for Cruise\u2019s mishandling of a much more serious incident in San Francisco last October. GM told an administrative law judge it was prepared to pay $112,500 to settle the California Public Utilities Commission\u2019s investigation of the failure by Cruise operatives to fully disclose that a Cruise vehicle had dragged a pedestrian down a street after the victim was hit by another car. GM had initially offered to pay a $75,000 penalty. Either amount is trivial to GM. The CPUC\u2019s suspension of Cruise\u2019s license to operate in San Francisco and the resulting layoffs and losses at Cruise are not. Waymo is seeking approval from state regulators to expand its service in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay area. The Cruise hearing and Waymo\u2019s scrape illustrate the challenges facing widespread commercial deployment of automated vehicles \u2013 obstacles that last week led auto tech supplier Aptiv to throw in the towel on its investments in Motional, a would-be rival to Cruise and Waymo. Nissan takes a tumble Investors dumped shares in Nissan Friday after the company reported disappointing results, sending the automaker\u2019s shares down by 12% - the biggest drop in two decades. The sell-off reflects the reality \u2013 obvious for some time \u2013 that Nissan is getting squeezed as Chinese automakers grab share in the world\u2019s largest market, and South Korea\u2019s Hyundai and Kia and other brands gain ground in the United States. In China, Nissan\u2019s margins are crumbling as BYD and other domestic brands slash prices. In the United States, Hyundai and Kia last year accounted for 9.8% of U.S. car and light truck sales \u2013 solidifying their position as a leading alternative for customers who don\u2019t want a Detroit brand truck or a crossover from Toyota or Honda. Nissan\u2019s U.S. share slid to 4.7%, according to sales data compiled by Automotive News. Nissan and its now-estranged partner Renault are both hitting rough seas as they sail on separate strategic journeys. Renault, whose weakness is fueling merger rumors, closed the week on a positive note. The French champion is close to clinching a deal with China\u2019s Geely to create a combustion engine joint venture. That news comes days after Renault scuttled plans for an IPO of its Ampere EV unit. Uber: Ride services are a business after all Uber turned a full-year profit for the first time since it went public in 2019. Surging demand for rides and delivery services boosted by the post-pandemic recovery in travel converged with stricter cost discipline. After years of effectively offering rides below cost, Uber is cashing in on its dominant scale in key markets, starting with the United States. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and other executives have scheduled a more detailed strategy briefing for investors on Feb. 14 at 8 AM Eastern time. Uber did not announce plans to return cash to shareholders with a share buyback, which disappointed some investors. But Uber shares have gained 145% since hitting a 52-week low last April. Fast Laps Volkswagen isn\u2019t giving up on plans to bring 25 electric vehicle models from its group of brands to the North American market by 2030, despite the uncertain near-term outlook for U.S. EV sales growth. VW is especially optimistic about the reception for its electric reincarnation of the 1960s micro-bus, the ID. Buzz, which lands in the United States late this year in numbers VW of America head Pablo Di Si expects to be insufficient to meet demand. Penske Automotive offered a revealing take on the health of competing automotive brands and the value of investing in automotive retail. Just 1% of the auto dealership operator\u2019s stores represent Detroit brands, the company said in its Q4 investor presentation. Another point: In 2018, Penske spent $1.50 on capex for every dollar it returned to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. In 2023, that ratio flipped. Penske delivered $1.52 to shareholders for every dollar in capex. LG Chem said it agreed on a $19 billion, 10-year deal to supply EV battery cathodes to General Motors through 2035. The cathodes \u2013 enough for 5 million EVs - would come from a new U.S. factory LG plans in Tennessee. LG and GM want to capitalize on U.S. EV battery production subsidies tied to domestic production. Magna and BorgWarner warned investors of slowing growth for 2024 as demand for EV and other technology slows down, and automakers shift investment toward ramping up production of combustion vehicles. Hyundai has picked banks to run a $3 billion IPO for its Indian operations, Reuters reported.\n\nAuto File is published on Tuesdays and Fridays. Think your friend or colleague should know about us?

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 states that have America's strongest unions. We have also discussed the latest unionization events. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 States That Have America's Strongest Unions.\n\nDating back to the 19th century, unions have fought for benefits like healthcare and retirement plans. They negotiate collective bargaining agreements with employers to secure better pay and benefits for their members. However, union membership has seen a decline since the mid-20th century, attributed to factors like globalization and anti-union legislation. It is worth mentioning that Union membership in the United States reached its highest point in 1954, with nearly 35% of workers belonging to a union. The total number of union members peaked in 1979, reaching an estimated 21.0 million.\n\nToday, the four largest unions in the United States are the National Education Association (NEA), established in 1857 with approximately 3 million members, representing public school employees such as teachers, support staff, and counselors. NEA is also considered the most powerful union in America. Following NEA is the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), founded in 1921, with approximately 1.9 million members, including healthcare professionals, janitors, and public service workers. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), established in 1932, claims around 1.5 million members, comprising employees of various government levels. Lastly, the Teamsters, with 1.4 million members, represent truck drivers, warehouse workers, and different trades.\n\nThe three least unionized states in the United States are South Carolina, North Carolina, and Dakota whereas the most unionized states are Hawaii and New York. According to Ziprecruiter, Washington leads for offering the highest union wages by state.\n\nIn recent years, coffee shops have become hotspots for labor organizing, with hundreds of workers across various locations fighting for unionization. However, the path from signing union cards to securing a contract can be fraught with challenges. The playbook used by companies, both large and small, often involves tactics from specialized law firms in union busting, leading to a protracted process.\n\nStory continues\n\nStarbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX), a prominent example, has seen unions certified at 375 locations, covering around 9,000 employees. Despite this, none have successfully negotiated a contract in over two years. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has docketed 725 charges against Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX), with allegations ranging from unfair labor practices to store closures aimed at suppressing union efforts.\n\nThe struggle at Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) has inspired workers beyond the coffee industry to consider unionizing, reflecting a broader trend of unions becoming trendy and appealing to a younger generation. The challenges faced by union baristas, including store closures and firings, highlight the risks involved in organizing at coffee shops, where owners may resort to drastic measures to thwart unionization efforts.\n\nSpeaking of Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX), it is one of the most popular fast food restaurants in America.\n\nRecently, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union have reached a tentative agreement. The development effectively ends the coordinated strikes against the Detroit Three automakers, including Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) and Stellantis NV. The agreement includes a record wage and benefit hikes which confirm major victories for auto laborers after years of stagnant wages and concessions made by the union post-2008 financial crisis.\n\nAnother example to highlight the strength of unions is how currently, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s Bessemer fulfilment center is facing the possibility of a third union election, with a crucial hearing scheduled for April 22. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) will assess objections raised by Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the Retail, Wholesale & Department Store Union (RWDSU) regarding the 2022 union election, determining if any unfair labor practices occurred. This dispute has persisted for three years and there was also a previous union vote in 2021 that was set aside by the NLRB due to Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) interference. In the second election on March 31, 2022, initial results showed 875 votes in favor of RWDSU representation, 993 against, and 416 challenged ballots, with 311 challenges remaining. Both the union and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) filed objections, and the upcoming hearing will address 14 objections from the union and seven from Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). 20 States That Have America's Strongest Unions\n\na katz / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the states that have America\u2019s strongest unions, we have relied on the percentage of employed wage and salary workers who are either members of labor unions or represented by labor unions, relative to the total employed workforce in each state for the year 2023. We obtained the percentages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The list is presented in ascending order.\n\nHere is a list of the states that have america's strongest unions\n\n20. New Hampshire\n\nUnion Members Employed: 9.3%\n\nThe New Hampshire State Employees\u2019 Association/SEIU Local 1984, one of the largest labor unions in the state, announced in 2023 that it will not endorse President Biden for reelection. In a statement, the union cited Biden's \"record and actions\" during his first two years in office and called for a \"competitive\" Democratic 2024 primary.\n\n19. Maryland\n\nUnion Members Employed: 10.7%\n\nCurrently, Maryland legislators and union leaders are advocating for three bills to extend labor rights. The Library Workers Empowerment Act aims to allow librarians at public libraries statewide to unionize. Another bill seeks to grant collective bargaining rights to over 4,000 state supervisors, addressing disparities. The third bill aims to extend collective bargaining rights to graduate students and faculty at Maryland universities. Proponents argue that unions reduce the wealth gap and improve conditions.\n\n18. Montana\n\nUnion Members Employed: 11.8%\n\nIn Montana, labor unions have been involved in advocating for workers' rights and fair treatment. One important union in the state is the Montana AFL-CIO, representing a range of workers across different industries, including mining, agriculture, and healthcare. They negotiate contracts and strive for better working conditions.\n\n17. Rhode Island\n\nUnion Members Employed: 12.3%\n\nThe offshore wind industry is gaining momentum in Rhode Island, with a focus on workforce planning and training. The state aims to build offshore wind as a renewable energy source, supported by federal policies and funding.\n\nConstruction labor unions are playing an important role in training and supporting the industry, ensuring projects are done efficiently. Various programs, such as Building Futures and WindWinRI, provide pre-apprenticeship courses and specific training for working on wind turbines.\n\n16. Nevada\n\nUnion Members Employed: 12.4%\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is reportedly planning a 10% or higher hourly pay rate increase for some workers at its Nevada Gigafactory starting in early January 2024. Internal sources reveal that hourly workers could see raises from $2 to $8.30 an hour. The decision is seen as an attempt to prevent unionization efforts and collective bargaining by addressing workers' concerns. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing increased competition for talent and potential union challenges, with the United Auto Workers expressing intentions to target non-unionized automakers like Tesla.\n\n15. Ohio\n\nUnion Members Employed: 12.5%\n\nOhio's union membership declined to 12.5% in 2023, slightly down from 12.8% in 2022 but still above the national rate. Despite a stable number of unionized workers (641,000), the state's workforce growth contributed to the percentage drop. The US saw a record low of 10% unionized workers in 2023. Public workers had a higher union rate (32.5%) than private-sector workers (6%). Ohio lost manufacturing jobs but gained in education and health services, witnessing recent unionization efforts.\n\n14. Massachusetts\n\nUnion Members Employed: 12.6%\n\nThe share of Massachusetts workers in unions has declined over the past decade, though less steeply than the national average. Notably, 32.5% of public-sector workers in Massachusetts were union members, while only 6% of private-sector workers belonged to unions in 2023.\n\n13. Illinois\n\nUnion Members Employed: 12.8%\n\nIn 2023, union membership in Illinois hit a record low as 27,000 workers across public and private sectors rejected union affiliation, bringing the overall membership rate to just 12.8%, the lowest in 34 years. This decline continued a 34-year trend, with the state's union membership dropping from 20.8% in 1989 to the current low.\n\nThis trend raises concerns about union leadership's alignment with member interests, as exemplified by major drops in major government unions like AFSCME Council 31 and the Illinois Federation of Teachers. Even SEIU HCII, which reported an increase in membership, still showed a huge discrepancy between reported and actual numbers, indicating potential dissatisfaction among workers.\n\n12. Michigan\n\nUnion Members Employed: 12.8%\n\nMichigan's unionization rate has declined over the past two decades, dropping from nearly 25% in 2003 to around 12.8% in 2023. Despite increased union approval in 2022, the state experienced a slight decrease from 14% in 2022. Nationally, the unionization rate was 10% in 2023, down from 10.1% in 2022 and a peak of 20.1% in 1983. Despite prominent achievements by unions, such as the UAW securing contracts and Teamsters winning concessions, the overall trend shows a decline in union membership.\n\n11. Pennsylvania\n\nUnion Members Employed: 12.9%\n\nUnion membership in Pennsylvania increased to 12.9% in 2023, up from 12.7% the previous year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This contrasts with the national trend, where union membership fell to a historic low of 10% in 2023 from a high of 20.1% in 1983. In 2000, Pennsylvania had a higher union membership at about 17%.\n\n10. Minnesota\n\nUnion Members Employed: 13.3%\n\nMinnesota labor unions, particularly the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters, are addressing the high rates of suicide among construction workers by treating mental health as a workplace safety issue. The unions offer no-cost counseling and training to members, aiming to connect workers with available help.\n\n9. Oregon\n\nUnion Members Employed: 14.1%\n\nIn Oregon, an increase in independent unionization is reshaping the labor market, with a record-breaking 126 petitions for new unions filed last year alone. The trend is notably driven by workers in different sectors, from strippers to vegan donut makers, opting for independent unions instead of affiliating with larger organizations like AFL-CIO or SEIU.\n\nThere are noteworthy examples like Burgerville Workers Union and Doughnut Workers United, inspired by the success of Burgerville's independent union in 2018. The movement is has a \"grow your own\" approach, as workers are seeking autonomy in crafting unions that represent their unique needs and concerns.\n\n8. Vermont\n\nUnion Members Employed: 14.3%\n\nBen & Jerry's has successfully reached a contract agreement with approximately 40 workers at its original Vermont location after the employees expressed a desire to unionize last year. The ice cream maker, known for its social activism, received support from its parent company, Unilever. It is one of the parts of the United States with the largest union membership.\n\n7. Alaska\n\nUnion Members Employed: 14.8%\n\nIn Alaska, 15.2% of the employed population is represented by Unions. In 2023, there were 45000 labor union members in the state.\n\nIn 2023, the Alaska State Employees Association, representing 8,000 state workers, filed a grievance alleging payroll issues due to chronic understaffing among state payroll workers. The union claims hundreds of members were paid incorrectly, some not receiving pay or only partial amounts in the past year. The state's payroll staff, handling 14,000 employees, has faced a high vacancy rate, reaching around 45% for months. The union demanded state response to pay-related complaints and compensation for affected workers, asserting it's a management issue.\n\n6. California\n\nUnion Members Employed: 15.4%\n\nIn 2023, there were 2,514,000 labor union members in California. Moreover, 16.9% of the employed population is represented by the unions.\n\nIt is interesting to note that half of California's union members are now women, and the majority hail from different ethnic and racial backgrounds. Furthermore, a large proportion of union members are employed in the public sector, constituting half of the total.\n\nClick here to see the 5 States That Have America's Strongest Unions.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Countries With The Highest Labor Shortages In The World 35 Low-Stress High-Paying Jobs In The World 25 States with Highest Average Salary in America\n\nDisclosure: None. 20 States That Have America's Strongest Unions is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 12 highest-paid women CEOs. We have also discussed the struggles and achievements of women CEOs. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest-Paid Women CEOs.\n\nChief Executive Officers play a pertinent role in shaping organizational strategies, fostering innovation, and driving overall success. Owing to their critical role, they are known to have one of the highest-paying jobs in the world. It is also one of the most profitable professions in the world.\n\nWomen CEOs, breaking traditional barriers, bring unique perspectives to boardrooms that eventually foster diversity, and enhance corporate resilience. Their leadership is essential for dismantling gender stereotypes, promoting inclusivity, and inspiring future generations. Women CEOs contribute not only to the bottom line but also to a more equitable and sustainable business environment. It is worth mentioning that Rosalind G. Brewer was the highest paid women CEO in 2021. Moreover, women are increasingly taking the lead in different domains, including sports and athletics. To read more about female athletes, see the highest paid female athletes in the world.\n\nIn 2023, Fortune's Global 500 list revealed a major rise in female CEOs, reaching a record-high 5.8% of the listed companies. This was a 20% increase from the previous year, with 29 women now leading major international businesses. Notably, the Fortune 500 still outpaces the Global 500 in gender diversity, with women heading 10.4% of US companies. For example, Karen Lynch from CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) is the largest woman-led Global 500 company.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Karen Lynch assumed the role of President and CEO of CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) on February 1, 2021, becoming the highest-ranking female CEO on the Fortune 500 list. Under her leadership, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) played an important role in administering the COVID-19 vaccine across long-term care facilities and CVS Pharmacy locations nationwide. Lynch successfully revamped the drug pricing business model at CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), introducing CVS CostVantage, a transparent cost-plus approach that reduced consumer costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe latest study by Germany's DIW Economic Institute reveals a concerning trend in gender representation at the top echelons of the country's corporate landscape. In 2023, the number of female CEOs at Germany's 200 largest firms dropped to nine, down from 10 in 2022 and 14 in 2021. This decline highlights the persistent gender disparity in leadership roles, with the CEO position remaining a stronghold for men.\n\nInterestingly, the study also notes a contrasting increase in female representation at the management board level. In 2023, 17.5% of management board positions were held by women, compared to 15.6% in 2022. However, the majority of firms (44%) still have no women on their management boards, indicating that women remain underrepresented in key decision-making roles.\n\nHowever, it is also worth noting that women\u2019s leadership in businesses does not come without challenges. Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), has completed a decade with her role and is currently facing critical challenges in 2024 that will shape her legacy. Despite guiding General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) through crises and achieving record profits, Barra's recent initiatives, particularly in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs), have faced setbacks. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)\u2019s stock has dropped 10.5% under her tenure.\n\nGeneral Motors Co (NYSE:GM)\u2019s EV plans which include a shift to exclusive EV production by 2035, have been hampered by slow rollout and production issues, with the Chevy Blazer EV sales paused due to software problems. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)\u2019s EV sales in 2023 were 2.9% of total sales, trailing Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Hyundai Motor Co. 12 Highest-Paid Women CEOs\n\ngoodluz/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the 12 highest-paid women CEOs, we are using Equilar's CEO Pay at the Largest Companies by Revenue to determine the total compensation for the 10 CEOs.

        "title": "The 7 Most Undervalued Penny Stocks to Buy in February 2024",
        "content": "Undervalued penny stocks are probably the most sought-after names for retail investors. Besides the low-price factor, penny stocks are known for providing some high adrenalin price-action. However, it\u2019s also a space for speculation and losses can be significant if wrong bets are made. My basic idea is to screen undervalued penny stocks and hold them for the medium term.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that speculative activity is high among undervalued penny stocks. Then again, we also have to consider that not all penny stocks have poor fundamentals. After all, there are some quality ideas that can deliver multi-bagger returns.\n\nI would, however, refrain from considering more than 10% to 15% exposure to undervalued penny stocks. It\u2019s a high-beta bet and considering the global macroeconomic scenario, I would remain overweight on blue-chip and high-quality growth stocks instead. That said, here are a few of the top, most undervalued penny stocks to bet on.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArcher Aviation (ACHR) Person holding cellphone with logo of American eVTOL aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nArcher Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) is a deeply undervalued name among flying car penny stocks. My view is based on the potential growth in the next five years with the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft due in 2025. Helping, Archer announced a collaboration under the NASA Space Act Agreement. This partnership will focus on achieving the highest levels of battery cell safety and systems for Advanced Air Mobility and space applications.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Archer has stitched partnerships for expansion in the UAE and India in 2026. With strong collaborations, the company is positioned for stellar growth once certifications are received.\n\nFrom a backlog perspective, Archer has orders worth $142 million from the U.S. Air Force. Further, in November 2023, the company won a contract worth $500 million from Air Chateau International for 100 Midnight aircraft. I expect the order backlog to swell further this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) a blink charging station, BLNK stock\n\nSource: David Tonelson/Shutterstock.com\n\nBlink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) fell by nearly 80% in the last 12 months. However, I do expect a strong rally from deeply oversold levels backed by positive business developments. With short interest in the stock at 37%, a massive short-squeeze rally seems likely.\n\nFor Q3 2023, Blink Charging reported stellar revenue growth of 152% on a year-on-year basis to $43.4 million. Further, the Company reported a 167% increase in gross profit to $12.8 million.\n\nWith significant room for penetration in the U.S. and Europe, revenue growth is unlikely to be a concern. The U.S. market alone is expected to require an investment of $100 billion by 2040 to boost the EV charging infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the good news is that Blink Charging expects to deliver positive adjusted EBITDA by December 2024. It\u2019s likely that EBITDA margin will continue to expand in the next few years with operating leverage.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) fell 36% for year-to-date. This does not come as a surprise with sentiments remaining negative for lithium. However, I am bullish on LAC stock for the long-term considering the asset potential.\n\nAs an overview, Lithium Americas has ownership of the Thacker Pass asset. It\u2019s the largest known measured and indicated lithium resource in North America. The asset has a mine life of 40 years with an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion. With an average annual EBITDA potential of $1.1 billion, Thacker Pass promises to be a cash flow machine.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that General Motors (NYSE:GM) is a strategic partner in the asset and has committed to invest $650 million. Further, GM has an offtake agreement for phase one production for ten years. This ensures clear cash flow visibility once production commences.\n\nBitfarms (BITF) Bitcoin and crypto mining farm. Big data center. High tech server computers at work. Bitfarms (BITF) mines crypto.\n\nSource: PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor investors bullish on Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF) is an attractive pick. The Bitcoin miner looks undervalued even after a rally of 100% in the last 12 months. With significant expansion plans, the company is positioned for stellar revenue and cash flow growth.\n\nTo put things into perspective, Bitfarms reported a hash rate capacity of 6.5EH/s as of January. The Company is targeting a capacity of 12EH/s in the first half of the year. Capacity is further expected to expand to 21EH/s by the end of the year. With visibility to triple capacity, the growth outlook is robust.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Bitfarms reported a liquidity buffer of $117 million as of December 2023. Further, the company expects to be debt-free this month. Therefore, financial flexibility is high for financing aggressive growth. If Bitcoin trades at new all-time highs this year, Bitfarms will generate ample cash flows to pursue the next leg of expansion in 2025.\n\nHecla Mining (HL) Gold bars and Financial concept, studio shots. Costco's gold bars, cost stock\n\nSource: Misunseo / Shutterstock.com\n\nHecla Mining (NYSE:HL) is an interesting bet among precious metal penny stocks to buy. With a strong jobs report for January, HL stock has corrected as expansionary policies might not come relatively soon. However, the correction is a good accumulation opportunity with the Company positioned for healthy production growth.\n\nFor 2023, Hecla announced silver production of 14.3 million ounces. With the restart of operations at Lucky Friday and Keno Hill ramp-up, production growth is likely to be robust. Hecla has guided for 20 million ounces in silver production by 2025. If this is associated with upside in gold and silver prices, the Company will be positioned to report healthy free cash flows.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Hecla reported a liquidity buffer of $165 million as of Q3 2023. Further, with a net leverage ratio of 2.2, the Company has high financial flexibility. This is important to mention as Hecla has pursued acquisition driven addition to its portfolio of assets.\n\nBlade Air Mobility (BLDE) The Blade Air Mobility (BLDE) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlade Air Mobility (NASDAQ:BLDE) has been weak in the last few quarters. However, fundamentals have improved and the stock looks undervalued considering the growth outlook.\n\nAs an overview, Blade Air is a provider of air transportation alternatives to the congested ground routes in the United States. The Company has an asset-light business model and growth seems to be gaining traction.\n\nFor Q3 2023, the Company reported 56% revenue growth on a year-on-year basis to $71.4 million. It\u2019s important to note that the Company achieved adjusted EBITDA profitability during the quarter. It\u2019s likely that EBITDA margin expansion will sustain in the coming quarters on the back of operating leverage.\n\nI must add that that the Company\u2019s medical segment revenue growth has been healthy. Blade Air is involved in the air transportation of human organs for transplant in the United States. Being a necessity, this segment is likely to continue growing at a strong pace.\n\nOverall, the business model is unique and there is increasing demand for air transport. BLDE stock is a potential multibagger from current levels of $2.9.\n\nSolid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) is working towards the commercialization of solid-state batteries. If the Company can achieve success, I believe that SLDP stock can deliver 10x or 20x returns from current levels. Without doubt, it\u2019s a high-risk bet, but some exposure can be considered after a correction of 55% in 12 months.\n\nIn terms of business progress, Solid Power shipped its first A-1 EV cell to BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) to formally enter automotive qualification. If the validation testing yields positive results, SLDP stock is likely to skyrocket.\n\nIn another recent development, the Company has deepened its partnership with SK On. Under the agreement, Solid Power will install a pilot cell production line for SK On at the Korea facility. SK On will also be using Solid Power\u2019s cell technology for research and development and to produce batteries. This agreement provides revenue visibility besides creating a parallel research and development platform.\n\nPenny Stocks\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "title": "3 Strong Buy Large-Cap Stocks to Add to Your February Must-Watch List",
        "content": "Without a doubt, large-cap stocks have been performing much better than small-cap stocks since the beginning of this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is made up of all large-cap stocks, has climbed 2.5% so far this year, while the S&P 500, whose performance is primarily driven by several strong buy large-cap stocks, is up 4.6% in 2024. Conversely, the Russell 2000, which tracks small-cap stocks is down 4% so far in 2024.\n\nGiven this data, it seems as though investors\u2019 phobia of small-cap companies that are not yet profitable, which took a highly justified hiatus late last year, has returned. Consequently, momentum traders and momentum investors should look to buy large-cap, highly profitable stocks whose issuers have strong balance sheets. Here are three strong buy large-cap stocks for them to consider.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nDriven by strong demand for its AI software and services, as well as its hybrid cloud offerings, IBM (NYSE:IBM) reported impressive fourth-quarter results on Jan. 25.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSpecifically, its income from continuing operations climbed 14.5% year-over-year to $3.285 billion. Moreover, Big Blue\u2019s free cash flow surged 1.7% year-over-year to $6.09 billion. Finally, the firm provided 2024 free cash flow guidance of $12 billion, well above Bank of America\u2019s (NYSE:BAC) estimate of $11 billion to $11.5 billion.\n\nIBM\u2019s AI business is growing rapidly, as its bookings related to the technology soared 100% in Q4 versus Q3. With many companies quickly integrating AI and turning to IBM for help with doing so, the phenomenon should continue to provide a major positive catalyst for the firm\u2019s profitability and for IBM stock going forward. This raid growth makes IBM one of the market\u2019s strong buy large-cap stocks.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) develops computer chips for many different products, and it\u2019s also a leader in the Wi-Fi and server storage sectors. Like IBM, AVGO has been a major beneficiary of the AI Revolution.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) recently began coverage of AVGO stock with an \u201coverweight\u201d rating, based on the strength of its AI chips business. Specifically, the bank expects the firm to benefit from strong demand for its chips used by datacenters which are both creating AI and facilitating much of its utilization at this point.\n\nMoreover, Broadcom\u2019s partnerships with both Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) should also boost its top and bottom lines in the medium-term and the long-term.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that AVGO has acquired Vmware, which should benefit from its alliance with the largest AI chipmaker, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Additionally, VMware has made Broadcom less dependent on its four largest customers, decreasing the risk that it faces.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) stock surged on Jan. 30 after the automaker delivered fourth-quarter results that came in significantly above analysts\u2019 average estimates. While the shares have largely tread water since then, they do appear to have formed a bullish reverse head-and-shoulder pattern this month.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as we get closer to the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, I believe that the shares are likely too pop. That\u2019s because lower rates makes buying vehicles much cheaper for the vast majority of purchasers who take out loans on them.\n\nAnother factor that could boost GM this year is the rapid winding down of the work-from-home phenomenon. As many more Americans resume commuting five days per week, the demand for GM\u2019s vehicles should surge.\n\nBank of America has a $75 price target on the shares, far above their current level of around $39.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Battery Stocks With Serious Potential to Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "You can\u2019t look at the electric vehicle (EV) sector without considering battery stocks. That\u2019s because batteries, specifically lithium-ion batteries, are as essential to the EV market as semiconductor chips. In this emerging sector, there are still many battery stocks with millionaire potential.\n\nHere\u2019s why: A 2022 analysis by McKinsey forecasts that the entire lithium-ion battery chain could reach a value of $400 billion by 2030. This would equate to growth of more than 30% annually between 2022 and 2030.\n\nMany EV companies are making significant investments to ensure an uninterrupted supply. However, despite the attention the EV market is receiving, growth is still in the early stages.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat being said, the pace of EV sales is slowing. Nevertheless, the long-term direction is higher and could begin to accelerate if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates as is expected at some point in 2024. That means, just like investors in artificial intelligence (AI) look to buy chip stocks, if you\u2019re looking to invest in EVs, it\u2019s a good time to consider battery stocks.\n\nHere are three battery stocks with millionaire potential for investors with a long-term outlook.\n\nPanasonic (PCRFY) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing/Shutterstock.com\n\nPanasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) is one of the undisputed leaders in this sector, yet it remains one of the battery stocks with millionaire potential. The company has an existing contract with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). However as the last few months have shown, this is why investors need to have patience with battery stocks.\n\nPanasonic cut battery production by 60% in October as a harbinger of falling EV sales. This announcement led to a 26% drop in PCRFY. However, since that point, the stock has recovered about 10%. Over the last 12 months, the stock has posted an 11.2% gain despite the volatility in the sector.\n\nThe growth in Panasonic stock is expected to come from the company\u2019s goal of increasing output at its Nevada facility by 10% in fiscal year 2025.\u00a0In addition to the increased output, Panasonic has plans to improve the energy density of its batteries.\n\nStory continues\n\nSixteen analysts have issued a price target for PCRFY stock and give it a consensus target of $13.37 which is a 41% price increase from Feb. 6.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) provides investors a different way to invest in battery stocks. As a lithium miner, Lithium Americas holds 100% interest in the Thacker Pass, the largest measured and indicated lithium resource in the United States. The potential output is one reason that General Motors (NYSE:GM) is investing $650 million in the project\u2019s financing.\n\nLithium remains an essential component of the lithium-ion battery. However, similar to the EV market, 2023 was a difficult time for lithium miners like Lithium Americas as lithium prices normalized after rising to all-time highs in 2022.\n\nDespite the recent challenge, lithium prices are unlikely to remain depressed, especially if the Federal Reserve cuts rates as expected. That would stoke demand for EVs which in turn will raise the price of lithium.\n\nLithium Americas is a small-cap company with a $653 million market cap and no revenue coming in the door. Production won\u2019t begin in the Thacker Pass until 2026 at the earliest. However, analysts remain optimistic and have established a $10.23 consensus price target, which is a 150% upside.\n\nAmprius (AMPX) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American company Amprius Technologies (AMPX) Inc. on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs I frequently do, I\u2019m leaving you with a speculative stock, but one that may be one of the best battery stocks with millionaire potential. Amprius (NYSE:AMPX) is not your ordinary manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries. The company is taking the challenge of energy density head on.\n\nA battery with higher density equates to more capacity in less space, leading to faster and less frequent charging. Amprius achieves this with a battery design that uses a silicon anode design in place of graphite to improve both energy density and cost.\n\nThis is a tiny company with a $363 million market cap. Currently, the company\u2019s customer base is mostly tied to aviation applications including drones, high-altitude satellites, and electric vertical take off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles.\n\nWhile, AMPX stock is down 27% in the last 12 months, it has improved in the last three months, rising 27%. Seven analysts have a consensus price target for the stock at $11.57 which would be a gain of over 158%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Ford's EV ambitions shift to big trucks and small cars after 'seismic change' in the market",
        "content": "Ford (F) reported strong earnings and an upbeat 2024 profit outlook and said the company will keep spending more on its EV transformation. But it's the details of this last strategy shift that have investors most excited.\n\n\"We think there has been a seismic change in the past six months,\u201d Ford CEO Jim Farley said on the conference call regarding the EV market in the US, in which \u201cEV manufacturers [are] cutting their price by 20% across all major geographies, and a tremendous amount of capital is flowing and a ton of new capacity into one single segment \u2014 two-row crossovers.\u201d\n\nFord\u2019s rethink of the EV market is still to invest, and somewhat heavily, it seems, into its Model e business unit but focus more on its Gen 2 EVs, which will bypass that \u201ctwo-row crossover market\u201d dominated by Tesla and other manufacturers. Farley said Ford will push into larger EVs like trucks and also try to capitalize on the new space.\n\n\u201cWe're going to focus those large EVs on geographies and product segments where we have a dominant advantage like trucks and vans,\u201d Farley said, then revealing that Ford is also \u201cadjusting our capital, switching more focus on to smaller EV products.\u201d\n\nThis means Farley and Ford essentially are abandoning that middle market for EVs. Unsold 2024 F150 Lightning electric pickup trucks sit in a long row at a Ford dealership Sunday, Jan. 21, 2024, in Broomfield, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe pivot to smaller EVs is a new wrinkle for Ford, which had pulled out of the entry-level sedan/compact market for its gas-powered cars in recent years, focusing its EV efforts on upmarket products like the Mustang Mach-E crossover and full-size Lightning pickup.\n\nFarley revealed more of Ford\u2019s small EV plans, claiming they had been in the works for some time. Over the past two years, Ford has had a hidden startup, or \"skunk works\" team, working internally on making a low-cost EV platform, he said.\n\nThis was music to the ears of Morgan Stanley\u2019sAdam Jonas. The analyst has criticized Ford for using its profitable Ford Pro commercial business, which he dubbed Ford\u2019s \u201cFerrari,\u201d to subsidize its \u201cEV science project.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWhat matters for the Dearborn re-rating story? More efficient build-partner-buy decisions on Model e, where we see scope for Ford to leverage its strong relationships with Chinese EV partners who we think can give them the best chance,\u201d Jonas wrote on Wednesday morning. Attendees admire the 2024 Ford Mustang Mach-E Rally during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, on Sept. 14, 2023. (Photo by MATTHEW HATCHER/AFP via Getty Images) (MATTHEW HATCHER via Getty Images)\n\nFarley didn\u2019t say whether the Ford team would collaborate with its Chinese partners, only that they were a threat to the business. \u201cAll of our EV teams are ruthlessly focused on cost and efficiency in our EV products because the ultimate competition is going to be the affordable Tesla and the Chinese OEMs,\u201d Farley said, adding that Ford\u2019s \u201cnext Gen 2 products will be profitable in the first 12 months of their launch.\u201d\n\nBarclays analyst Dan Levy also liked Ford\u2019s change in EV spending.\n\n\u201cWhile the EV transition remains central for Ford, commentary on the call indicated some pivot on EV strategy for Ford \u2014 reflecting the broader market challenges in EV demand. Overall, Ford is pushing to be more mindful of capital requirements and vehicle economics,\u201d Levy wrote.\n\nThe pivot to making a smaller EV poses a risk, however, Levy noted. \u201cWhile there is a white space for this offering, this is a sharp contrast from Ford\u2019s efforts to electrify with its leading franchises, and begging the question of what type of economics Ford could ultimately achieve with such a vehicle,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom a competition point of view, Tesla is the only Western-based automaker that makes EVs with a healthy profit margin. The thinking goes that Tesla is likely the only automaker (aside from Chinese rivals like BYD) that can make a cheap EV affordable. At least that\u2019s the goal for Tesla and its upcoming $25,000 EV.\n\nWhether Ford can accomplish its pivot \u2014 abandoning the middle market for EVs and going high-end with trucks and low-end with small EVs \u2014 is the risk investors in the long-term are making with Ford. But as Ford indicated, for the near term at least, the auto business will be strong based on the performance of its traditional gas-powered business and Ford Pro\u2019s continued growth \u2014 now its most profitable business with $1.8 billion in EBIT last quarter alone.\n\nCount Barclay\u2019s Levy in the group that is happy to see Ford soldier on with its ICE (internal combustion engine) business, while the EV world sorts itself out.\n\n\u201cWhile we believe an overhang remains on the EV transition for Ford and other legacy automakers, we nevertheless appreciate the near-term benefits of stronger ICE earnings,\u201d Levy said.\n\nFor Ford and Farley, hopefully the profits from the ICE and Pro businesses can keep funding an EV transformation that\u2019s seemingly evolving in real time.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "General Motors (GM) Inks a $19B Deal for EV Battery Materials",
        "content": "In a move aimed at fortifying the electric vehicle (EV) market, U.S. auto giant General Motors GM and South Korean battery supplier LG Chem inked a monumental $19 billion deal. The agreement, spanning roughly the next decade, is set to redefine the landscape of EV production and marks one of the largest supply contracts in GM's history.\n\nThe deal outlines LG Chem's commitment to supplying GM with more than 500,000 tons of crucial cathode materials between 2026 and 2035. These materials, including nickel, cobalt, manganese and aluminum, are vital components for EV batteries, powering vehicles with a range exceeding 300 miles. Notably, this supply is projected to fuel approximately five million EVs, underlining GM's ambitious EV production targets.\n\nThe cathode materials will be sourced from LG Chem's state-of-the-art plant, which is currently under construction in Tennessee. This strategic location aligns with GM's joint venture battery cell plants across North America, including Ultium Cells LLC, an entity formed in collaboration with LG Energy Solution. By strengthening the regional supply chain, the partnership aims to bolster EV production in North America, catering to the burgeoning market demand.\n\nJeff Morrison, GM's vice president of Global Purchasing and Supply Chain, emphasized the significance of this contract in reinforcing GM's commitment to building a robust and sustainable EV supply chain. He highlighted the pivotal role of the agreement in supporting GM's rapidly expanding EV production requirements. Additionally, Morrison stressed the importance of localizing production in Tennessee, thereby enhancing the resilience of the North American supply chain.\n\nLG Chem's CEO, Shin Hak-cheol, echoed Morrison's sentiments, emphasizing the strategic cooperation between the two companies in spearheading the North American EV market toward a sustainable future. He underscored the shared goal of delivering unique customer value through enhanced productivity and the expansion of global production capacities.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis groundbreaking deal builds upon the foundation laid by GM and LG Chem's initial agreement in 2022, wherein LG Chem committed to supplying GM with 968,000 tons of cathode active material through 2030. The extension of the partnership underscores GM's enduring commitment to EVs despite the industry's slower-than-anticipated adoption rate. It signifies a strategic pivot toward long-term planning, adapting to evolving market dynamics while reaffirming GM's position as a frontrunner in the EV revolution.\n\nMoreover, the agreement holds broader implications for the EV market, signaling a paradigm shift toward sustainable transportation solutions. As governments worldwide ramp up efforts to combat climate change, the electrification of transportation emerges as a critical strategy. GM's substantial investment in EV battery materials underscores its dedication to driving this transformation forward, setting a precedent for other auto giants to follow suit.\n\nWith a focus on sustainability, innovation, and strategic collaboration, the partnership sets the stage for accelerated growth and technological advancement in electric mobility. As GM and LG Chem pave the way for a greener automotive future, the ripples of their collaboration are poised to reshape the automotive landscape for years to come.\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nGeneral Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nSome top-ranked players in the auto industry are\u00a0Goodyear Tire GT, PACCAR PCAR and Oshkosh Corporation OSK, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

        "content": "There are many reasons for individuals to buy an electric vehicle (EV) in 2024. And a lot more reasons for stock investors to add some up-and-coming EV giants in their portfolios.\n\nFor one, climate change is on everyone\u2019s minds. Buying electric vehicles is seen as one of the key and easy ways consumers can help. EVs offer carbon footprint reduction and portfolio growth potential, aligning with the shift to zero-emission transportation.\n\nAdditionally, in response to China\u2019s declining lithium prices, potential has emerged for investors in undervalued EV stocks. Amidst the nascent EV revolution, these companies overlooked by Wall Street, hold substantial upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI think three strong and potential EV stocks deserve attention from EV fans and investors.\n\nByd Co. (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nBYDCo. (OTCMKTS:BYDDF), the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle manufacturer, has now expanded beyond roads to seas. In January, the company\u2019s inaugural vessel, \u201cBYD Explorer No. 1,\u201d set sail with 5,000 cars. This strategic move to launch the company\u2019s own shipping fleet addresses global demand and cost efficiencies. It\u2019s also one I\u2019m very keen on, and think other major players in this space will likely copy.\n\nNotably, BYD surpassed its ambitious three million unit sales target, topping global new electric vehicle sales for the second consecutive year. Entering the top 10 global auto sales, it remains China\u2019s best-selling brand with a remarkable 62% year-over-year growth. Despite December\u2019s impressive 45% sales surge to 341,000 units, aggressive sales tactics like discounts and cash prizes impacted profit margins, with an anticipated 86.5% increase in profits for 2023.\n\nIn a press release, BYD announced plans to expand its fleet with seven additional vessels within two years. This vertical integration move is one long-term investors will want to consider. And with the stock still trading at an impressively low multiple of 17-times earnings, there\u2019s plenty of room for upside from here.\n\nStory continues\n\nPolestar Automotive Holding (PSNY) Close up Polestar logo with electric car in store. Polestar (PSNY) is a Swedish automotive brand owned by Volvo Cars and Geely\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nKnown to be Volvo\u2019s (OTCMKTS:VLVLY) biggest partner, Sweden-based Polestar (NASDAQ:PSNY) recently revealed their latest SUV model, the Polestar 3. Set to be the EV market\u2019s biggest challenger yet, the model EV will drive Polestar to growth. With an impressive 300-mile range and excellent reviews from those who have bought it, it\u2019s expected to rival Tesla\u2019s Model Y. That said, the stock also trades at a low forward price-sales ratio, which is a good opportunity for investors to buy.\n\nPresently, PSNY stock has declined as Hertz (NADSAQ:HTZ) delayed purchasing its EVs, opting to sell some Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) models instead. Hertz previously ordered 100,000 Tesla Model 3s in 2021, followed by adding Model Ys the next year. Later, it struck a deal with Polestar for up to 65,000 EVs, aiming for a quarter of its fleet to be electric by 2024. However, the plans have now been abandoned.\n\nHowever, Polestar did see upward earnings estimate revisions, a bullish sign for long-term investors. Over the past month, Polestar\u2019s consensus EPS estimate for the year rose by 1.7%, indicating analysts anticipate improved earnings.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) GM Chevy Bolt EV electric car is seen charging at a Volta Charging Station in a parking lot. EV stocks\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is set for higher heights this 2024 especially after it revealed a successful Q4 earnings report and an optimistic 2024 guidance. The report showed an impressive $1.8 billion profit and an equally-impressive earnings per share number of $1.24. Thus, the company surpassed guidance and expectations on both the top and the bottom-line, providing a reprieve for investors who know how tough 2023 was for the auto maker.\n\nIn Q4, GMC and Cadillac saw declines of 6.5% and 7% in higher-priced vehicle sales. A key strike cost GM $1.3 billion. However, the guidance for this year is skewed positively, with GM anticipating a $14 billion profit at most and $9.50 earnings per share. The company also aims to produce over 250,000 battery EVs, about 30% more than they produced in the past 12 months.\n\nCurrent GM CEO Mary Barra has outlined her priorities. These include: optimizing the company\u2019s ICE lineup, expanding the profitable EV business and revamping Cruise\u2019s autonomous vehicle unit. Following incidents in California, Cruise testing ceased in October, with CEO Kyle Vogt resigning the following month. After a challenging 2023, GM\u2019s recovery may already be underway, making it an opportune time for a buy-and-hold strategy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Ford's (F) latest quarterly results out Tuesday were the latest to underscore the challenge facing an auto industry moving towards an electric future \u2014 high prices.\n\n\"We learned that as you scale EVs to 5,000, to 7,000 units a month, and you move into the early majority customer, they are not willing to pay a significant premium for EVs,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley said on Tuesday's earnings call.\n\nFarley added that as subsidies for EV purchases rolled off, pricing for EVs \"quickly converged to hybrids.\"\n\n\"Now, Tesla (TSLA) found out this first but we were right behind that ... But we learned very quickly, and I want to say that no one will be immune to this reality,\" Farley said.\n\nFarley's comments come as Ford reported quarterly results that saw revenues and profits top expectations, while the company forecasted increased losses in its EV-focused unit as it gets more competitive on pricing.\n\nFord shares were up as much as 4% on Wednesday.\n\nThe conversation about pricing power \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 from automakers looking to turn their fleets toward EVs continues to be the biggest theme in the industry in 2023.\n\n\"I just can't emphasize enough how important cost is,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said back in the fall. \"\u2026We have to make our products more affordable so people can buy [them].\"\n\nAccording to data from Bank of America published last month, of 62 electric vehicle models currently sold in the US, only 20 have a starting manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price below $45,000.\n\n\"A lack of affordability, limited choice and 'range anxiety' are likely key reasons for the relatively sluggish mass market EV adoption,\" the firm wrote.\n\nTheir findings also show \"hybrid vehicles are bridging some of the gap to full EV transition, while the choice and affordability of EVs should improve from here.\" More expensive vehicles are making up a larger share of hybrids purchased in recent months. (Source: Bank of America)\n\nThe demand for gasoline-powered vehicles has, in part, prompted energy companies to continue their oil and refined fuels production, while at the same time investing in technologies for the energy transition.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, ExxonMobil (XOM) announced a lithium initiative to become a major provider of the critical metal used to make electric vehicle batteries.\n\n\"We see an opportunity to supply approximately 1 million electric vehicles per year by 2030,\" said ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods during the company's earnings call last week. \"With economically advantaged production, it has a much smaller environmental impact than today's supply.\"\n\nThe transition, at least in the US, is also not evenly distributed geographically, creating additional dynamics for the company to work through.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, for instance, sales of the F-150 truck, Ford's best-selling vehicle, saw a 50/50 mix of hybrid or EV vehicles and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. In Dallas, Farley said the split in favor of ICE vehicles was more like 85/15. \"Hybrids will play [an] increasingly important role in our industry's transition, and will be here for the long run,\" Farley told analysts on Tuesday. A Ford electric F-150 truck is displayed outside of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on March 23, 2023, in New York City. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Spencer Platt via Getty Images)\n\nFord is also betting that giving customers more choice will be crucial in the transition away from traditional ICE vehicles and towards EVs, both in terms of price and performance.\n\n\"All of our EV teams are ruthlessly focused on cost and efficiency in our EV products because the ultimate competition is going to be the affordable Tesla and the Chinese OEMs,\" Farley said.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "The EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) entered the new year by missing analyst estimates along with a warning of slower growth this year. But\u00a0Chinese EV makers\u00a0Nio\u00a0(NYSE: NIO),\u00a0XPeng\u00a0(NYSE: XPEV), and\u00a0Li Auto\u00a0(NASDAQ: LI) kicked off 2024 with rising YoY deliveries, with BYD Company Limited (OTC: BYDDY)\u00a0seeing its best January yet with a 33% YoY rise, although even BYD experienced a MoM drop from December for about a third. BYD also ended 2023 by surpassing Tesla for the first time during the last quarter of the year. But although even the mighty\u00a0Tesla reported a dismal quarter, a pickup accessory maker Worksport (NASDAQ: WKSP) who is promising to bring game-changing products to the EV front,\u00a0reported impressive fourth quarter figures on Tuesday.\n\nTesla reported weak auto revenue during the fourth quarter.\n\nTesla also warned its\u00a0vehicle volume growth\u00a0this year could be notably lowered to 2023.For its fourth quarter, Tesla reported revenue rose 3% to\u00a0$25.17 billion, coming short of LSEG\u2019s\u00a0$25.6 billion\u00a0estimate. Tesla also reported its operating margin almost halved from last year\u2019s comparable quarter when it amounted to 16% to\u00a08.2%. This year, Tesla will be focused on\u00a0launching its \u201cnext-generation\u201d\u00a0vehicle\u00a0and therefore, it finds itself between two major growth waves. Tesla ended 2023 by getting the long-anticipated electric pickup to the market but it warned that ramping up the production of the Cybertruck will take longer compared to its other models due to the vehicle\u2019s increased complexity.\n\nWorksport, who specializes in pickup accessories, told a different quarterly story today. Its unaudited revenue for its fourth quarter skyrocketed\u00a02,050%\u00a0YoY to\u00a0$839,690, after already reporting an impressive growth of\u00a02,400%\u00a0in its third quarter.\n\nDuring the reported quarter, Worksport launched a second production line at its state-of-art U.S. facility as it continues to confidently march ahead to make its mark in the field of sustainable automotive innovation. Both quarters are a reflection of Worksport\u2019s strategic execution as it ramped up production of its \u201cmade in the USA\u2019tonneau covers that will be available even on Amazon and Walmart. Besides redefining standards when it comes to light bed tonneau covers, Worksport is preparing for the alpha release of its COR portable battery system, which will be followed by the SOLIS solar-powered tonneau cover. The power duo that Worksport is bringing to the market promises to address range anxiety and bring the opportunity to power remote locations, redefining off-road driving and enhancing camping experiences across the globe.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile some fear the EV progress is slowing down with traditional automakers like General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F) switching gears and scaling down their efforts in response to challenges that are even slowing down Tesla, companies like Worksport could be the ones to turbocharge EVs back to growth with their innovations.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors have had a miserable year. The stock is already down more than 20% in 2024. And it could get worse for Elon Musk before it gets better.\n\nThat\u2019s because two of the electric vehicle maker\u2019s biggest traditional automotive rivals\u2026 Ford (NYSE:F) and Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) just both reported phenomenal results, in large part due to the success of their hybrid offerings.\n\nFord, Toyota Head Up on Hybrids\n\nShares of Toyota briefly touched new all-time highs Tuesday after the Japanese auto giant reported strong earnings and lifted its outlook for 2024. The stock is now up more than 20% this year. Toyota noted that demand for hybrid vehicles, which have both gas-fueled internal combustion engines and electric-battery powered motors, surged nearly 38% in the first three quarters of its most recent fiscal year. The company added that sales of hybrid Toyota and Lexus models in China were steady and strong.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFord posted strong earnings as well after the closing bell Tuesday, lifting its stock 2% Wednesday morning and pushing shares into positive territory for 2024 in the process. Ford CEO Jim Farley said in the earnings release that its Ford Blue gas and hybrid unit is booming, thanks largely to sales of its hybrid F-150 and Maverick trucks.\n\n\u201cWe sold about 700,000 hybrids worldwide over the past three years and Ford is the only brand in the top three in both hybrids and EVs in the U.S.,\u201d Farley said in the earnings release. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting double-digit hybrid growth again in 2024.\u201d\n\nThe healthy earnings from Ford and Toyota come just one week after General Motors (NYSE:GM) indicated that it was going to start selling some plug-in hybrids in the U.S. after discontinuing its Chevrolet Volt a few years ago in favor of all-electric cars.\n\nGM CEO Mary Barra said on a conference call that the company \u201cremains committed\u201d to going fully electric by 2035 but conceded that it will be a challenge for both the company and consumers that still want gas-powered cars and trucks. \u201cDeploying plug-in technology in strategic segments will deliver some of the environmental benefits of EVs as the nation continues to build its charging infrastructure,\u201d she noted. GM shares are also outperforming Tesla so far this year, rising about 6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTesla, meanwhile, has been struggling due to concerns about intense competition in the U.S. and China. Rivals are offering cheaper EV models, which has prompted Tesla to cut prices. That may be good news for consumers, but it\u2019s not what Tesla investors want to hear. Analyst worries about the Cybertruck being a flop, coupled with continued concerns about how committed Musk is to Tesla after a Delaware judge voided his massive compensation package, could be weighing on the stock as well.\n\nAnd the latest earnings from Ford and Toyota are just one more reason why legacy auto stocks are probably a better bet right now. The fact that other major car companies are finding success with their own EVs as well as hybrids is just one more headache that Tesla doesn\u2019t need.\n\nAs of this writing, Paul R.

With each STEM badge earned, girls across the country are provided with a multitude of activities that blend technical skills with the Girl Scout Leadership Experience (GSLE). Through these badges, Girl Scouts expand their identities as users, shapers and creators while gaining the skills, confidence and ambition needed to address the problems that directly affect their local communities.\n\nWith the new playbook in hand, all Girl Scout staff and supportive adults are equipped with resources and expertise to support girls through their very own tailor-made STEM journeys. This playbook serves as a comprehensive guide, walking readers through a wide variety of topics, including the need for women and girls in STEM, barriers that often deter girls from exploring STEM and what can be done to improve accessibility. It provides a resource directory with topical information, examples of careers, Girl Scout programs and other opportunities to grow Girl Scouts' interests and skills. The playbook also uplifts stories of Girl Scouts and Girl Scout councils already making a difference.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We are grateful for our partnership with General Motors,\" said Bonnie Barczykowski, chief executive officer of GSUSA. \"This new playbook provides the support our troop leaders and volunteers want and need as they engage in STEM activities with their Girl Scouts in exciting new ways.\"\n\nWith Girl Scouts earning more than 5 million STEM badges since 2018, Girl Scout councils have voiced a need for additional resources to support Girl Scouts' participation in STEM experiences. With increased investment in STEM programming,\u00a0councils can ensure that troop leaders and supportive adults have easily accessible support and resources to confidently usher girls though their individual journeys. Many adults who work with Girl Scouts are not science or engineering experts, and that's okay\u2014Girl Scouts' program is designed for non-experts. Offering resources like this playbook will make the supportive adults in Girl Scouts' lives more comfortable with engaging in STEM activities and make it easier for them to facilitate opportunities for girls to explore their interests and possible career paths.\n\n\"From the launch of the Automotive Badge series to this new STEM playbook, General Motors is proud of our work with Girl Scouts of the USA over the last five years,\" said Kristen Puchek, chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer at General Motors. \"Programs like these are inspiring the next generation of women leaders and visionaries in STEM fields and are a real asset to our industry.\"\n\nGirl Scouts is dedicated to ensuring girls across the nation have the confidence, courage, and character needed to take on the world of STEM.

        "title": "Is It Worth Investing in General Motors Company (GM) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about General Motors Company (GM).\n\nGeneral Motors Company currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.83, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 21 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.83 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 21 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 9.5% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GM Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for GM\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for General Motors Company here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying General Motors Company, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs GM Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for General Motors Company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 17.2% over the past month to $8.83.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for General Motors Company. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for General Motors Company may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "General Motors (GM) Recalls 300K+ Vehicles Amid Tailgate Woes",
        "content": "General Motors GM has issued a recall affecting 323,232 vehicles due to safety concerns related to the tailgate mechanism. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has highlighted a potential issue where the electronic gate-release system could unlatch the tailgate while the vehicle is in motion, posing a significant road hazard and increasing the risk of a crash. This recall encompasses certain models of Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks manufactured between 2020 and 2024.\n\nThe affected models include the Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500, as well as the GMC Sierra 2500 and 3500. The problem extends to the gate potentially unlocking even when the truck is parked, adding another layer of risk. General Motors received numerous complaints regarding this \"unwanted tailgate opening\" between Sep 1, 2020, and Aug 1, 2023.\n\nGeneral Motors made the decision to initiate a safety recall on Jan 25, approximately 20 days after concluding an analysis of field incidents potentially related to the issue. Owners of the affected trucks have been advised to ensure that the tailgate is securely closed and latched before driving until they receive formal notification of the recall, which is expected by Mar 18.\n\nThe inspection and repair of the affected exterior switch pad assemblies will be performed at no cost to the customer. However, due to the unavailability of necessary parts, owners will be notified by dealers once they become accessible, according to the NHTSA.\n\nThe company has been facing several recall issues in recent months. In December, a recall was issued for 2024 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks due to concerns about mysteriously cracking roofs, affecting over 3000 models.\n\nEarly last month, the Chevrolet Blazer EV was also subject to a recall due to potential door striker fractures, affecting a limited number of vehicles. This issue was traced back to improper heat treatment of parts manufactured by the Brano Group, leading to an elevated risk of failure.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, General Motors recalled several BrightDrop all-electric delivery vans following incidents where front drive units caught fire. A total of 66 of the 2022 model year EV600 BrightDrop delivery trucks were recalled last month due to a manufacturing defect in the front drive unit.\n\nThese recalls underscore the importance of proactive safety measures in the automotive industry. General Motors is taking necessary steps to address these issues promptly and ensure the safety of its customers.\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nGeneral Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nSome top-ranked players in the auto industry are Goodyear Tire GT, PACCAR PCAR and Oshkosh Corporation OSK, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GT\u2019s 2024 sales and earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 2.7% and 2,152.6%, respectively. The EPS estimate for 2024 has improved by 15 cents in the past 30 days. Goodyear has a Value Score of A.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PCAR\u2019s 2024 and 2025 EPS has improved by 51 cents and 34 cents, respectively, in the past 30 days. The company surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 17.1%.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 7, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are Itron, Inc. ITRI, EnerSys ENS, Centene Corp. CNC and General Motors Co. GM.\n\n4 Low P/CF Stocks to Navigate the Economic Landscape in 2024\n\nAfter an impressive 2023, the trajectory of the economy in 2024 hinges significantly on the dynamics of the labor market and the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates. The Fed faces a delicate balancing act, contemplating policy choices that could either stifle economic momentum or risk reigniting inflationary pressure.\n\nThe job market has been painting a promising picture lately, with nonfarm payrolls expanding by 353,000 in January, surpassing expectations. The unemployment rate, holding steady at 3.7%, coupled with decent wage growth of 4.5% year over year, reinforces the robustness of the job market.\n\nThe recent decision of the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged underscores the need for consistent evidence of inflation easing before considering rate cuts. The interplay between economic growth and inflation containment will require astute and adaptive investment strategies to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate risks.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the best investment strategy for 2024? We believe investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential. Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company\u2019s business.\n\nOne such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis \u2014 the lower the number, the better. Itron, Inc., EnerSys, Centene Corp. and General Motors Co. and boast a low P/CF ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy P/CF Ratio?\n\nYou must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, an important factor that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company\u2019s financial health.\n\nAnalysts caution that a company\u2019s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.\n\nA positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company\u2019s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company\u2019s liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.\n\nHowever, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.\n\nHere are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nItron, a technology and service company that offers products and services for energy and water resource management, sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 289.3%, on average.

Itron has a Value Score of B. The stock has rallied 21.9% in the past year.\n\nEnerSys, the global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications, sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10.4%, on average.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for EnerSys\u2019 current financial year EPS suggests growth of 60.3%, respectively, from the year-ago period.

It may take some time for all the EV stocks to recover, but a few stocks are trading at a discount today, and they have the potential to double in 2024. If you believe in the future of EVs and are ready to make the most of the transition, here are the EV stocks to double this year.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of the best Chinese EV makers in 2023, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) has a lot working for it this year. The company has impressed investors with strong deliveries and financials. After reporting over 50,000 deliveries in December, the company reported deliveries of 31,165 vehicles for January. While it is a month-over-month drop, it is a 105% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Its cumulative deliveries at the end of January stood at 664,529 vehicles. It aims to deliver 800,000 vehicles annually.\n\nLi will start delivering Li MEGA next month and it could help Li Auto report stronger delivery numbers. LI stock is trading at $30.56 today and is up 22% in the year. However, it is down 11% year-to-date (YTD) and this is a chance to grab the stock. It has the potential to double this year and you could take home big gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLi Auto is a highly reliable company as compared to several other EV makers today, and it plans to introduce eight competitive models this year. It is also working on enhancing the technical capabilities of its autonomous driving features to meet the consumers\u2019 expectations. In the third quarter, the company reported a net income of $385 million.\n\nIf you are looking for EV stocks to double, consider Li Auto as a top choice. This is one EV maker that has big plans for the year and is working on expanding its lineup. As the macroeconomic conditions improve, Li Auto will be one of the best out there. Yes, the January deliveries could have been better, but it is still a sharp YOY rise, and the upcoming results will beat expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nBYD Company (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the biggest EV makers today, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) is on an aggressive expansion spree and has been growing its network. The company is also the second-largest battery maker in the world and has reported impressive deliveries. Due to the price war in 2023, BYD had to resort to several price cuts and this led to massive sales. It has dethroned Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) with the highest deliveries and has also dethroned Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY)\u00a0as the best-selling car brand in Germany.\n\nIn the nine months ended September 30, the company saw a 57% YOY rise in revenue to $59.32 billion, and the profit saw a 115% rise YOY to hit $3.66 billion. The company has recently entered the shipping business and has set 5,000 cars on its vehicle carrier which is named BYD Explorer No.1.\n\nThis is a very important move for the company as it will make it easier for it to deliver cars to various countries while reducing the cost. This is a new roll-on, roll-off carrier that will head to India after making stops in Germany and the Netherlands. It speaks a lot about the demand for BYD cars. The company aims to add another seven vessels to the fleet over the next two years.\n\nBYD has a diversified portfolio which works as a catalyst for the business, and it enjoys a strong pricing power that allows it to export and cater to the demand of the consumers. BYDDF is one of the best EV stocks today and it is down 13% YTD. Trading at $23.42, the stock is much lower than the 52-week high of $36, but it has the potential to hit $40s in the near term.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) GM Chevy Bolt EV electric car is seen charging at a Volta Charging Station in a parking lot. EV stocks\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a renowned automaker that is making a shift towards EVs. The company is investing in electric vehicles and aims to report a profit in the EV segment by 2025. Currently, the company is using the profits from the combustion engine models to fund the costs of the EV segment, and it aims to spend about $11 billion to $13 billion annually through 2025.\n\nWhile it is not a pure-play EV maker, General Motors has been around the auto industry for years and understands the way it works. It reported strong quarterly results and impressed investors with solid guidance for the year. Its revenue came in at $43.0 billion and generated $11.7 in free cash flow in the year. Despite the disruption caused to the finances by the United Auto Workers strike, the company has recovered well. Its EPS came in at $1.24 and the stock rallied after the results.\n\nIt has issued strong guidance and expects a free cash flow in the range of $8 billion to $10 billion for the year and an EPS in the range of $8.50 to $9.50. The projections show that GM is committed to continuing the same momentum while the stock looks undervalued to me. GM stock is trading at $37 and is lower than the 52-week high of $43. It remains one of the top EV stocks to own after the results. The future is bright for GM, and owning the stock while it is trading at a discount is a smart move.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy in February 2024",
        "content": "Since betting on the individual companies of the Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 offers a solid chance for long-term profitability, it stands to reason that going for undervalued S&P 500 stocks could potentially net you robust returns. In a way, it\u2019s like having your cake and eating it too.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, sports fans have long wondered what would happen if the weakest team in the NFL went head-to-head with the strongest team in college football. Chances are, the pro team should run circles around the college team because we\u2019re dealing with professionals. And that\u2019s somewhat analogous to the idea of undervalued S&P 500 stocks.\n\nIf we\u2019re dealing with a framework of 10 to 20 years, betting on established large-capitalization giants that are going through a rough time still arguably present better odds than gambling on some penny stock on a hot streak. Even if the upstart enterprise pulled some impressive quarters together, it still must overcome credibility concerns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn the other hand, the large cap simply needs to get its head on straight. With that, below are enticing undervalued S&P 500 stocks to consider.\n\nLyondellBasell (LYB) A LyondellBasell production plant in Wesseling, Germany is seen at dusk.\n\nSource: Flagmania / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpecialty chemicals giant LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB) isn\u2019t exactly in a great place right now. Recently, the company\u2019s profit and revenue fell in the fourth quarter of 2023. That stemmed from soft global demand in the petrochemical markets and lower gasoline crack spreads. Subsequently, LyondellBasell also missed the consensus target for earnings per share, though it beat on revenue.\n\nNevertheless, the positive aspect is that LYB represents one of the undervalued S&P 500 stocks. Presently, shares trade at only 9.82X forward earnings, below the industry median print of 15.7X. Also, while acknowledging the recent revenue fallout, over the past three years, it enjoys a 16.1% sales growth rate. Nevertheless, LYB trades at a discount to revenue of 0.73X.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, with the U.S. economy booming, it\u2019s quite possible that other countries could follow suit. And that would imply more resource consumption and therefore greater demand for specialty chemicals. Not surprisingly, analysts view LYB as a consensus moderate buy with a $103.67 average price target.\n\nCVS Health (CVS)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs one of the most recognizable names in the broader pharmaceutical space, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is a relevant enterprise. However, most investors don\u2019t see it that way. For example, it suffered a lackluster performance in 2023, largely due to fears of rising competition in the retail pharmacy space. Still, even with the encroachment, CVS presents an intriguing market idea.\n\nFor one thing, Fortune Business Insights notes that the U.S. pharmacy market size reached a valuation of about $534.21 billion in 2020. By 2028, this segment could be worth $861.67 billion. If so, this would represent a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.3%. There should be plenty of room for key competitors to grow, especially with the aging baby boomer population.\n\nAnd speaking of which, CVS enjoys a massive footprint, allowing for better service for boomers. Since this demographic is usually big on tradition, CVS may win out on brand trust.\n\nLastly, CVS trades for only 8.6X forward earnings, below the underlying sector\u2019s median print of 13.35X. With a strong buy assessment from analysts, CVS is one of the undervalued S&P 500 stocks to consider.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn iconic automotive manufacturing firm, General Motors (NYSE:GM) has had a difficult year in 2023. Perhaps most notably, GM along with other domestic rivals suffered from the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike. However, with that headwind largely out of the way, GM stock has been steadily rising higher since early November. It\u2019s possible that the company can continue on its upward trek.\n\nFor one thing, General Motors offers a credible pivot to electric vehicles. Sure, the field is crowded. However, with the industry\u2019s low-hanging fruit plucked, it\u2019s all about selling EVs to average-income customers. Frankly, GM can scale production to meet this forward demand profile. As well, it enjoys a vast dealership network and brand trust \u2013 relatively speaking.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s not abandoning its motorhead heritage, as its eighth-generation Corvette demonstrates. So, I think it\u2019s an exciting brand which is on a credible discount. Shares trade at 5.05X forward earnings, well below the sector median 10.87X. And analysts anticipate shares hitting $48.29, making GM one of the undervalued S&P 500 stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor Co., buffeted by electric vehicle losses and rising labor costs, posted fourth quarter results that soundly beat expectations and forecast higher profits in 2024.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Denied Immunity in DC Election Case by Appeals Court Xi to Discuss China Stocks With Regulators as Rescue Bets Build King Charles Treated for Cancer in New Royal Health Scare Wall Street Snubs China for India in a Historic Markets Shift Treasuries Rally Before Record 10-Year Bond Sale: Markets Wrap\n\nThe automaker Tuesday posted adjusted earnings per share of 29 cents, more than double the 13 cents analysts expected on average. Fourth quarter revenue of $46 billion surpassed the $40.3 billion analysts expected.\n\nFor the current year, Ford forecast earnings of $10 billion to $12 billion before interest and taxes, compared with $10.4 billion on that basis in 2023. That result was on the high end of the $10 billion to $10.5 billion the company predicted in November, when it lowered guidance following a six-week strike the by the United Auto Workers union.\n\nFord shares pared a gain of as much as 8.8% in postmarket trading, rising 6.3% to $12.83 as of 4:26 p.m. in New York. The stock closed regular trading down 1% on the year.\n\nAs electric vehicle sales slow, Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley is attempting to thread the needle between scaling back the company\u2019s EV spending by $12 billion while dialing up output of traditional internal combustion engine models, which generate profits needed to fund future growth. The automaker just halved production of electric F-150 Lightning pickups, while boosting output of its highly profitable Bronco sport-utility vehicles and Ranger pickup trucks.\n\n\u201cThey have a very strong combustion engine business they can fall back on to help subsidize the transition to EVs and also make money now,\u201d David Whiston, an analyst with Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said in an interview before Ford posted results. \u201cThey absolutely should be trying to crank out a ton of Broncos right now.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nEV Red Ink\n\nThe automaker lost $4.7 billion on electric vehicles last year before interest and taxes, more than the $4.5 billion EV deficit Farley predicted in July. That translates to a loss of roughly $38,000 on each battery powered model Ford sold last year, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Joel Levington, who noted those losses are \u201cunsustainable.\u201d\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Ford\u2019s EV unit, known as Model e, posted a loss of $1.57 billion, which was greater than the $1.34 billion loss analysts expected.\n\n\u201cThe Model e unit may improve its loss per vehicle by more than $10,000 in 2024,\u201d Levington wrote in a Feb. 1 note. \u201cYet at an estimated $28,000 loss per unit, the segment will slice more than $4 billion off Ford\u2019s profitability in addition to capital investments.\u201d\n\nThe Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker also faces higher labor costs than its crosstown rival General Motors Co., which wowed Wall Street last week with a 2024 forecast of $12 billion to $14 billion in earnings before interest and taxes. GM has said the contract it struck with the UAW will add about $575 in costs per car, while Ford predicts an increase of up to $900 per vehicle due to the record deal that increases workers\u2019 wages by 33% over four and a half years.\n\n\u201cGM is better set up to absorb those labor costs because they already had a healthier cost base in North America,\u201d Whiston said. \u201cAnd Ford has more UAW employees in the US than GM.\u201d\n\nIn its traditional internal combustion engine business, known as Ford Blue, the company earned $813 million before interest and taxes in the fourth quarter, less than the $866.5 million analysts expected. Ford\u2019s US sales rose less than 1% in the fourth quarter as the UAW strike cost it production of high profit models such as the F-Series Super Duty pickup truck and the Explorer SUV.\n\nIn its commercial business, known as Ford Pro, the automaker earned $1.81 billion before interest and taxes, more than the $1.43 Billion analysts expected. Bloomberg Intelligence predicts Ford Pro will see margins expand this year while its Ford Blue unit will experience margin pressure as pricing drops because dealers have replenished their lots with inventory after pandemic-related shortages.\n\n\u201cFord profit is on a tightrope as the transition to electric vehicles takes longer than expected, requiring right-sizing to cut EV losses while managing increased pricing competition for Ford Blue,\u201d BI analysts Steve Man and Peter Lau wrote in a Feb. 2 note. \u201cOur scenario sees US electric-vehicle sales climbing 9% this year after growing at a compounded annual rate of 65% over the past three years.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Ed Ludlow.\n\n(Updates from fourth paragraph with postmarket shares; adds details from earnings release.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong The Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

        "content": "This year is going to offer a lot of opportunities for risk seeking investors. The world of penny stocks is well known to be speculative and is usually the domain of investors possessing a risk seeking profile.\n\nThe year is shaping up to be a strong one for speculative investment. The Federal Reserve is slated to cut interest rates multiple times this year, which should cause a flood of liquidity in the markets as lending rates fall. Cheaper lending will lead to increased risk appetites overall, benefiting speculative penny stocks.\n\nBearing that in mind, let\u2019s look at seven penny stocks that can triple your capital based on target prices.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAgilon Health (AGL) Medicine and healthcare concept - team or group of doctors and nurses\n\nSource: Supavadee butradee / Shutterstock.com\n\nAgilon Health (NYSE:AGL) is a healthcare stock that has not started 2024 as it had hoped. On Jan. 5 the company updated guidance to reflect its expectation of higher costs in late 2023.\n\nThe Austin-based healthcare provider that primarily serves Medicare Advantage members updated guidance to reflect higher overall costs on that date. The result has been a halving of share prices, which have fallen from $12 to below $6 in the subsequent weeks.\n\nThe company has experienced a higher number of outpatient surgeries, specialist visits, and increases to Part B drugs and supplemental benefits. The slight offset from lower overall admissions has not been enough to prevent the company from revising guidance downward.\n\nAs bad as all of that may sound, Agilon Health share prices are rising and should continue to rise throughout the year.\n\nThe current consensus forecast is that the shares should rise to $18 over the next 12 to 18 months. In other words, 200% returns are entirely possible. The highest forecast suggests shares could reach $30 over the same period.\n\nBilibili (BILI) picture of bilibili (BILI) logo on a phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nBilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Is a penny stock trading at $9 and as such may soon lose its penny stock status.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company provides video based content throughout China that includes user-generated videos and contents, audio, comics, mobile games and more.\n\nThe bullish news for investors is that analysts expect it could rise as high as $120. It currently trades for $9 and benefits from a consensus share price above $28.\n\nDuring the third quarter, Bilibili Reported an average of 103 million daily users. Of its 341 million monthly active users, 29 million were paid. Users spent an average of 100 minutes on its content during the third quarter.\n\nYet problems continue to play the Chinese economy overall. That resulted in flat revenues during the quarter. However, the company reported a 21% increase in ad revenues in Q3. Given how high it\u2019s expected to rise, now is an excellent time to consider investing.\n\nWheels Up Experience (UP) Private jet waiting to be boarded on runway with snowy mountains in the background. UP stock\n\nSource: bruno talledo / Shutterstock.com\n\nWheels Up Experience (NYSE:UP) provides on demand aviation services and is one of the largest private charter firms in the world. The platform serves a base of 11,000 members connecting them to a network of 1,500 private aircraft.\n\nThe bad news about the company is that its most recent earning period was not strong. Revenues fell by $100 million, dipping to $320 million overall. Net losses were substantial but flat, reaching $145 million.\n\nYet, there continue to be a lot of reasons for bullishness. For one, Delta (NYSE:DAL) invested $450 million in capital along with several other partners. Strong industry leader backing is an obvious benefit.\n\nBeyond that, there\u2019s a reason to believe that on demand Aviation Services will grow in 2024. The macroeconomic outlook continues to improve and lending rates will fall in 2024. That alone could be enough to spike demand for the company\u2019s services.\n\nIHS Holding (IHS) A digital illustration of the telecom industry.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIHS Holding (NYSE:IHS) owns, operates, and develops telecommunications infrastructure across several emerging market nations.\n\nThe company\u2019s presence spans Latin America, the Middle East, and both North and sub-Saharan Africa. The consensus forecast is that the stock will double from its current price of $7. However, analysts believe it could rise as high as $23.\n\nIt has not been smooth sailing for IHS Holding of late. During the third quarter, revenues fell by over 10%. a large part of that decline was because of unfavorable foreign exchange rates for the Nigerian Naira.\n\nThe Naira declined in value by over 78% during the period. The company remains confident that it will not suffer as much because of the unfavorable foreign exchange rate. CEO Sam Darwish maintains that FX protection mechanisms will result in stronger fundamentals in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe company upheld its previous guidance for all of 2023, which shows that it truly believes FX headwinds will not affect it further.\n\nRelay Therapeutics (RLAY) Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocks\n\nSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlmost every list of high potential penny stocks includes a biotech firm like Relay Therapeutics (NASDAQ:RLAY).\n\nThe company develops precision medicine, including small molecule therapeutics designed to aid in the treatment of cancer and genetic diseases.\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, there is a lot to like about Relay Therapeutics. Many high potential biotech penny stocks are pre-revenue.\n\nHowever, Relay Therapeutics is not one of them. During the third quarter, the company reported $25.2 million in revenues. That is a dramatic increase from a year prior when the company reported a mere $0.3 million in revenues. The company continues to produce net losses, with a 65.7 million net loss in the most recent period.\n\nRevenues improved as rapidly as they did, primarily because of milestone payments that are part of a collaboration agreement with Genentech.\n\nThe company will report updates for two of its clinical stage programs in 2024. Those will continue to be significant catalysts. further, the company will also disclose new pre-clinical programs during the year.\n\nSeabridge Gold (SA) Gold bars and Financial concept, studio shots. Costco's gold bars, cost stock\n\nSource: Misunseo / Shutterstock.com\n\nSeabridge Gold (NYSE:SA) acquires and explores gold properties throughout North America. Mining exploration stocks are speculative. That is true of Seabridge Gold, which experiences rapid swings in its ability to generate revenues from period to period.\n\nFor example, Seabridge Gold posted a $5.3 million net loss during Q3 of 2023. A year prior, it posted $5 million in net income. Ultimately, investing in mining exploration companies is simply a gamble.\n\nSeabridge Gold, like all others, buys property rights and attempts to derive profits from those projects. During the third quarter, the company spent $73.7 million to acquire additional mineral rights on various properties.\n\nWhether that investment pans out remains to be seen, but the single analyst with coverage of the company expects its shares to rise to $25 in the future. Shares currently trade for $10 so a 200% return is a bit of a stretch goal.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) a lithium ion battery\n\nSource: Olivier Le Moal/ShutterStock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is the best known and highest potential stock on this list. The company recently separated its operations in order to isolate its development of the Thacker Pass lithium deposit in Nevada.\n\nSacropass is the second largest confirmed lithium deposit globally. it is geopolitically important given its location entirely within the United States.\n\nHowever, it remains a gamble given a few factors. For one, lithium prices have collapsed. No one knows when they will rebound. Some experts suggest that a rebound could begin later in 2024, while others think it may not materialize until 2026.\n\nFurther, Lithium Americas remains in the early stages of development. Site construction is scheduled to occur throughout 2024. The company should begin producing lithium in mid-2026.\n\nThe company has developed a major partnership with General Motors (NYSE:GM). Although GM\u2019s early development of electric vehicles has not gone to plan, the company continues to have substantial resources. That\u2019s part of the reason that analysts are so bullish on LAC shares overall.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Despite recent headwinds reflected in subpar results, the company\u2019s strategic move to triple its lithium conversion capacity to 600ktpa by 2027 showcases a bold commitment to seizing the EV market\u2019s long-term upward ascent. This expansion, aligning with the anticipated resurgence in lithium prices, heralds a future of robust cash flows for its business.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, despite the headwinds, Albemarle\u2019s resilience shines through its financial guidance, projecting a substantial operating cash flow of $600 to $800 million for 2023.

        "title": "4 Low P/CF Stocks to Navigate the Economic Landscape in 2024",
        "content": "After an impressive 2023, the trajectory of the economy in 2024 hinges significantly on the dynamics of the labor market and the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates. The Fed faces a delicate balancing act, contemplating policy choices that could either stifle economic momentum or risk reigniting inflationary pressure.\r\n\r\nThe job market has been painting a promising picture lately, with nonfarm payrolls expanding by 353,000 in January, surpassing expectations. The unemployment rate, holding steady at 3.7%, coupled with decent wage growth of 4.5% year over year, reinforces the robustness of the job market.\r\n\r\nThe recent decision of the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged underscores the need for consistent evidence of inflation easing before considering rate cuts. The interplay between economic growth and inflation containment will require astute and adaptive investment strategies to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate risks.\r\n\r\nSo, what\u2019s the best investment strategy for 2024? We believe investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential. Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company\u2019s business.\r\n\r\nOne such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis \u2014 the lower the number, the better. Itron, Inc. ITRI, EnerSys ENS, Centene Corporation CNC and General Motors Company GM and boast a low P/CF ratio.\n\nWhy P/CF Ratio?\n\nYou must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, an important factor that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company\u2019s financial health.\r\n\r\nAnalysts caution that a company\u2019s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.\r\n\r\nA positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company\u2019s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company\u2019s liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.\r\n\r\nHowever, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bargain Hunting Strategy\n\nHere are the parameters for selecting true-value stocks:\r\n\r\nP/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.\r\n\r\nPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\r\n\r\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\r\n\r\nP/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.\r\n\r\nP/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.\r\n\r\nP/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company\u2019s sales \u2014 the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.\r\n\r\nPEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\r\n\r\nValue Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.\r\n\r\nHere are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:\r\n\r\nItron, a technology and service company that offers products and services for energy and water resource management, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

        "title": "Can General Motors' Rally Continue?",
        "content": "Shares of General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) have moved sharply higher over the past three months, delivering a total return of nearly 40%. The stock has benefited from a number of positive developments, including an end to the UAW strike against the company, a massive accelerated share repurchase program and strong 2024 guidance provided by management.\n\nWhile a significant number of shares have already been delivered under the ASR, the banks managing the program still have a significant number of shares which need to be repurchased to complete the program. Consensus fiscal 2024 estimates remain well below the company's recent guidance, which sets the automaker up to potentially deliver better-than-expected earnings per share for the year. Additionally, despite the recently rally, the stock trades at under 5 times forward earnings compared to an average price-earnings ratio of 6.80 over the past few years. For these reasons, I believe GM shares can continue to move higher from current levels.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with GM. Can General Motors' Rally Continue?\n\nGM Data by GuruFocus\n\nRepurchase program will continue to be supportive of the stock\n\nOn Nov. 29, GM announced a $10 billion ASR program that represented about 25% of the company's shares outstanding at the time. On Dec. 1, the company advanced $10 billion to a group of banks and received approximately 215 million shares of stock with a value of $6.80 billion. Thus, these shares were repurchased at a price of roughly $31.60 per share. Final settlement of the transaction is expected to occur no later than Dec. 31, 2024. By this time, the banks managing the ASR will be required to deliver GM roughly an additional $3.20 billion worth of shares. The repurchase price will be based on the average daily volume weighted average price of GM shares during the term of the ASR agreements less a discount.\n\nGiven these facts, the banks managing the ASR will continue to be active buyers of GM shares throughout much of 2024 in order to acquire shares they need to deliver under the agreement. In addition to the ASR, GM has a remaining authorization of roughly $1.30 billion based on prior repurchase authorizations, which the company can complete if it chooses to do so based on market conditions.\n\nStory continues\n\nI view the repurchase program as a solid capital allocation decision given the stock's low valuation. Based on a forward price-earnings ratio of 4.50, GM is repurchasing shares at an earnings yield of more than 20%. Given the highly competitive nature of the auto business, I do not believe the company would be able to earn this level of return on capital by reinvesting in the business itself given the historically low ROIC that the company has generated.\n\nConsensus earnings estimates are below company guidance\n\nCurrently, Wall Street analysts' consensus for fiscal 2024 call for the company to report adjustd earnings of $7.80 per share. Comparably, during the company's fourth-quarter 2023 earnings release, the company guided for a range of $8.50 to $9.50 for the year. Based on this difference, I believe the company is poised to deliver better than consensus results.\n\nMoreover, the company's guidance itself may prove to be conservative. Historically, around 78% of companies in the S&P 500 have beaten their estimates on a quarterly basis. One reason for this is that company executives generally do not want to disappoint investors.\n\nIn early 2023, GM guided for 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $6 to $7 and ultimately delivered adjusted earings of $7.68. The beat came despite the fact the company faced a crippling UAW strike, which had a negative impact on the company.\n\nIf the company is able to deliver a similar beat on a percentage basis, as was the case in 2023, versus initial guidance midpoint, the adjusted earnings per share for 2024 would be approximately $10.60 per share.\n\nValuation is still compelling\n\nGM currently trades at roughly 5 times consensus 2024 earnings per shares. This compares to the broader market, which trades at approximately 22 times consensus 2024 earnings. Surely GM should trade at a multiple which is well below the broader market given the highly cyclical nature of its business and historically low return on invested capital. However, I think the current discount is too extreme. Over the past three years, the stock has traded at an average earnings multiple of 6.80 times. Additionally, GM's closest peer, Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F), trades at roughly 6.60 times consensus 2024 earnings.\n\nThe stock currently has a GF Value of roughly $53 per share, which would imply a forward price-earnings ratio of roughly 6.80 times the current consensus and 5.90 times its 2024 guidance. In this case, I agree with the GF Value and believe the stock can trade in the $50 range. Can General Motors' Rally Continue? Can General Motors' Rally Continue?\n\nGM Data by GuruFocus\n\nKey risks to the bulls\n\nThe most significant risk the GM bulls face is a significant economic slowdown. The auto business is highly cyclical and thus GM would experience a hit to financial performance in the event of an economic slowdown. However, it should be noted the company currently has a very strong balance sheet with just over $36 billion in automotive liquidity. This liquidity buffer should allow the company to ride out an economic storm and make it through the cycle, but the stock price may suffer during the interim.\n\nAnother risk GM faces is potential market share losses to competitors as the automobile business is highly competitive and currently experiencing a secular shift toward electric vehicles. For 2023, GM reported total U.S. market share of 16.20%, which represents a roughly 0.30% increase from market share the previous year. The company's share of the EV market as of the fourth quarter of 2023 is estimated at 6.9% and thus, a rapid shift toward EVs has the potential to result in decreased market share for GM.\n\nConclusion\n\nGM shares have rallied sharply over the past three months due to a number of positive developments, but the bullish move may not be done.\n\nThe company's massive ASR program will continue to serve as an upside catalyst in 2024 as banks work to complete the necessary purchases. Additionally, consensus estimates for 2024 adjusted earnings per share remain well below company guidance, which is likely conservative. Thus, I believe the company is poised to deliver better-than-expected earnings results. Finally, GM's valuation remains fairly cheap despite the massive move higher over the past few months.\n\nFor these reasons, I believe the recent rally can continue.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 States With the Most EV Chargers Per Person.\n\nUS Boosts EV Infrastructure\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, the sales of electric vehicles in the US surged to over 300,000 for the first time, according to an article published by Reuters, on October 12, 2023. The article cites a report by Cox Automotive, which states that the sales in 2023 were reported to be nearly 2 times more compared to 2022. Electric vehicles accounted for 7.9% of the industry sales in the US in 2023. However, multiple challenges hinder the growth of the EV market including high prices and restricted charging infrastructure.\n\nOn January 19, Reuters reported that the US Department of Transportation and Energy will be making a $325 million investment across three different programs, aiming to advance EV technologies, repair chargers, and cut battery costs. Moreover, it awarded nearly $150 million for repairing and replacing around 4,500 existing electric vehicle charging ports in 20 states. The new funds for electric vehicle chargers are a part of the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. The program is funded by a $1 trillion 2021 infrastructure law, which says that the states must employ federally-funded EV charging ports for a minimum of 5 years operating 97% of the time. These efforts are expected to contribute positively to the US EV market.\n\nKey Players in the US EV Market\n\nSome of the major companies in the electric vehicle market include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM).\n\nOn January 31, Reuters reported that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has decided to expand its battery production to Nevada. The company aims to bring cheaper lithium iron phosphate batteries (LFP) to the US. This strategic move by Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will reduce reliance on foreign sources for raw materials such as Nickel and Cobalt. The company will buy the equipment from Contemporary Amperex Technology Limited (SHE:300750). The new plant in Nevada will have an initial capacity of nearly 10 gigawatt-hours.\n\nStory continues\n\nLucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) is a leading EV manufacturer in the US. On November 16, 2023, the company announced the launch of its new electric SUV, Lucid Gravity luxury electric SUV. The high-performance vehicle will accommodate up to seven adults and will feature a driving range of 440 miles. Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) will start the production of the Lucid Gravity SUV in late 2024.\n\nTalking about the Lucid Gravity SUV, CEO and CTO of Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID), Peter Rawlinson said:\n\n\u201cThe Gravity SUV represents a significant leap forward for Lucid\u2019s world-leading technology and design. Customers will find an unprecedented combination of space and maneuverability, luxury, and versatility, all seamlessly integrated into one remarkable vehicle with the driving experience and range of a true Lucid. Lucid\u2019s innovative proprietary EV powertrain technology and our holistic approach to vehicle engineering already enabled the Air sedan to redefine what was thought possible from a luxury sports sedan. With Gravity, these innovations evolved and our next generation technology is applied with even greater effect, resulting in an electric SUV that can achieve over 440 miles\u00b9 of range with a battery pack a little more than half the size of some of our battery-hungry competitors.\u201d\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is a leader in the EV market in the US. On January 30, the company announced its earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. The company reported an EPS of $1.20 and beat estimates by $0.10. The company reported a revenue of $42.98 billion for the quarter and outperformed estimates by $3.51 billion. Here are some of the comments from General Motors Company's (NYSE:GM) Q4 2023 earnings call:\n\n\"At GM we expect healthy industry sales of about 16 million units. We have an unmatched ICE portfolio in North America, rising EV production on the LTM platform and GM Financial continues to perform well. We're building on a foundation of products that our customers love. In 2023, GM sold more vehicles in the US than anyone else. All of our US brands grew their sales year-over-year and gained US market share with healthy margins, thanks to stable pricing and incentives that were more than 20% below the industry average. The Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV had record sales. We led the industry in initial quality for the second year in a row according to J.D. Power. And we now have led the industry in combined pickup, full-size van, and full-size SUV sales for 10 consecutive years, making us the leader in the highest ATP quadrant of the market and helping us lead the commercial fleet market. And we have passed Honda and Toyota in the most affordable quadrant, thanks to attractive and profitable vehicles like the Chevrolet Trax, which is one of Car and Driver's 10 best trucks and SUVs, and the Buick Envista, which is winning with younger buyers. In fact, more than one in four Envista customers are between the ages of 18 and 35. The broad-based momentum we have today is important for our future because our customers are the most loyal in the industry.\"\n\nOn November 8, 2023, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) announced that it had partnered with Niron Magnetics, a pioneer producer of low-cost and high-performance permanent magnets free from critical materials. The partnership aims to develop rare earth-free magnets for EV motors. The cheap and environment-friendly magnets will enable General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) to create a sustainable and affordable supply chain for an all-electric future. The company had also invested in Niron Magnetics to help them commercialize their sustainable magnets.\n\nWith this context, let's have a look at the 15 states with the most EV chargers per person. 15 States With the Most EV Chargers Per Person\n\n15 States With the Most EV Chargers Per Person\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 15 states with the most EV chargers per person, we sourced the data for EV charging ports from the Alternative Fuels Data Center of the US Department of Energy.

        "content": "General Motors (GM) continues to see a future in its troubled Cruise robotaxi fleet \u2014 but in what form remains unclear.\n\n\"We're still very committed, and we still see that as a big growth opportunity for us,\" GM CFO Paul Jacobson said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above).\n\nThe support for the beleaguered Cruise \u2014 GM's self-driving division \u2014 came after GM told investors on its fourth quarter earnings release a week ago that it's aiming to slash expenses related to the brand by a whopping $1 billion this year.\n\nThis level of expense slashing at Cruise would suggest the potential for the robotaxi fleet to go away entirely and have its tech advancements folded into GM's cars and trucks or licensed out to other transportation parties.\n\nJacobson added that a more complete view of Cruise's operating structure will arrive later this year for investors.\n\n\"We're still focused on the tech,\" Jacobson said. \"We're still investing heavily in our engineering staff, and we're committed to [doing] that. We're going to reassess that strategy and think about what's the right way to roll it out and how ... we think about capital structure in the weeks and months ahead. There's more information to come later this year as we think about what the right approach to bring Cruise to the market is.\"\n\nFor now, Cruise remains in park after a rough 2023 of headlines and financial performance.\n\nOn Oct. 2, a Cruise vehicle ran over a woman in San Francisco. The woman was struck by a human-driven car and thrown in front of the self-driving Cruise vehicle, the LA Times reported. The Cruise robotaxi didn't process the incident correctly, which caused the woman severe injuries, as the car reportedly dragged her 20 feet.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles suspended Cruise's license to operate in the state. The agency determined that Cruise's vehicles are not safe for public operation. Cruise also misrepresented safety information about the driverless technology, the department said.\n\nStory continues\n\nCruise paused all its driverless operations.\n\nThe incident led to the departure of Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt, who boasted in 2022 that the brand would hit $1 billion in sales by 2025. It also led to a series of ongoing investigations and inquiries by various government agencies, according to Yahoo Finance's review of GM's new annual report.\n\n\"In addition, certain federal and state agencies, including the California DMV, the California Public Utilities Commission, NHTSA, the US Department of Justice, and the SEC, have opened investigations or made inquiries in connection with the incident,\" GM outlined in the report. \"We and Cruise are investigating these matters internally and intend to cooperate with all government regulators and agencies in connection with these matters. At this time, we are not able to predict when Cruise will resume driverless testing or commercial AV operations.\"\n\nGM acquired Cruise in 2016 for $1.1 billion. In 2021, Cruise played a starring role in GM's guidance to double revenue by 2030. Cruise was projected to increase its sales to $50 billion by the end of the decade from virtually nothing at the time. General Motors continued its public support of Cruise but acknowledged it will be updating its strategy for the autonomous driving unit.\n\nAuto experts tell Yahoo Finance that Cruise's major stumbles highlight the challenges of safely scaling up driverless taxis and whether they need to exist at all. GM may be better served by following the path of its peers and permanently shelving Cruise, given the hit to public trust in the brand.\n\n\"Cruise is a distraction for General Motors,\" said Gregory Migliore, editor in chief of Autoblog, a sister publication to Yahoo Finance. \"It\u2019s a troubled company whose time may never come.\"\n\nIf the headlines aren't enough for GM to wave goodbye to Cruise, then the numbers perhaps would do the trick.\n\nCruise generated a mere $102 million in sales last year and lost $2.7 billion on an adjusted operating basis, per GM's annual report. In 2023 and 2022, Cruise lost a combined $4.6 billion on an adjusted operating basis as GM invested in the segment's autonomous tech and platform more broadly.\n\nThe $102 million in sales for Cruise is a fraction of the $141.4 billion GM generated from selling cars, trucks, and SUVs in North America last year. GM has paused the operations of its Cruise robotaxi business. (Terry Chea/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"Cruise, and the now-defunct Argo AI, highlight the dangers of trying to create a market without demand,\" Migliore continued. \"Frankly, nobody is asking for robot taxis. Ford and Volkswagen were smart to pull the plug on Argo AI in 2022 and reallocate those resources to driver assistance technology consumers will actually get in cars. I think it\u2019s curious GM has stayed with Cruise for so long, when the automaker has shown an ability to adapt in other areas, like its recent pivot back to hybrids.\"\n\nWith GM spending billions of dollars to roll out electric vehicles, an argument could be made that EVs should be the area of focus, not Cruise robotaxis that would somehow challenge nonexistent Tesla (TSLA) robotaxis.\n\nTo that end, GM's annual report shows the Cruise division has $1.3 billion in cash on hand that could likely be allocated to more productive venues.\n\nStaying committed to Cruise's original vision also doesn't align with a GM in the process of cutting billions in costs and being more shareholder friendly \u2014 as seen in a massive new $10 billion stock buyback.\n\n\"We see capital allocation as the primary catalyst that is likely to lead to a re-rating in the shares,\" JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman explained in a note to clients.\n\nThere continues to be some support for Cruise on Wall Street, though it has waned considerably in the past 12 months of negative headlines.\n\n\"I think Cruise is essential to the future of GM, as autonomous is a next-generation technology that will transform the auto world,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance. \"We see by 2030 10% of cars will be autonomous and GM wants in on that market with Tesla well ahead.\"\n\nIves gave GM stock an Outperform rating with a $40 price target, about 5.2% above current levels.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "Does General Motors Company (GM) Have the Potential to Rally 25.98% as Wall Street Analysts Expect?",
        "content": "General Motors Company (GM) closed the last trading session at $38.91, gaining 8.1% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $49.02 indicates a 26% upside potential.\n\nThe average comprises 20 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $27 to a high of $95, with a standard deviation of $17.94. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 30.6% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 144.2% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.\n\nWhile the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.\n\nBut, for GM, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.\n\nHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price Targets\n\nAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.\n\nWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?\n\nStory continues\n\nThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.\n\nHowever, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.\n\nThat said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.\n\nHere's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in GM\n\nThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 17.7%, as six estimates have moved higher while one has gone lower.\n\nMoreover, GM currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much GM could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Trending Stock General Motors Company (GM) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "General Motors Company (GM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +8.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors Company falls in, has lost 19.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nGeneral Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.99 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -10%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.8%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.73 points to a change of +13.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +17.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.90 indicates a change of +2% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +17.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for General Motors Company.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate of $41.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4%. The $174.54 billion and $176.94 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.6% and +1.4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $42.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.3%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $2.12 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.78 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.4%. The EPS surprise was +10.71%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGeneral Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Despite Fast-paced Momentum, General Motors Company (GM) Is Still a Bargain Stock",
        "content": "Momentum investors typically don't time the market or \"buy low and sell high.\" In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that \"buying high and selling higher\" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.\n\nWho doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.\n\nA safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (GM) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:\n\nInvestors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 8.1% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this company well in this regard.\n\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. GM meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 44.9% over the past 12 weeks.\n\nMoreover, the momentum for GM is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.49. This indicates that the stock moves 49% higher than the market in either direction.\n\nGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that GM has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped GM earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nMost importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, GM is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. GM is currently trading at 0.26 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 26 cents for each dollar of sales.\n\nSo, GM appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.\n\nIn addition to GM, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.\n\nThis is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick.

        "content": "Last week, many auto biggies released U.S. vehicle sales data for the month of January 2024. According to GlobalData, the daily selling rate last month averaged 42,300 units, a significant decline from December's rate of 56,800. The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales, reported at 14.8 million by GlobalData, fell well below initial forecasts, ranging from 15.2 million to 15.8 million. This figure also represents a decrease from December's 16.08 million and January 2023's 15.26 million. While January typically records lower new vehicle sales, the latest SAAR reading marks the lowest for the month since 2012, a period when the industry was still recovering from the 2008-09 financial crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, quarterly results of U.S. auto giant General Motors GM, auto retailer Group 1 Automotive GPI and heavy equipment maker Oshkosh Corp OSK were released last week. General Motors\u2019 fourth-quarter 2023 earnings and sales beat estimates but declined year over year. Group 1 missed earnings estimates but beat on revenues. While the bottom line fell 12.5% year over year, revenues rose 10%. Oshkosh\u2019s earnings topped estimates and also increased on a yearly basis. Revenues missed the consensus mark but increased year over year.\n\nOne of the leading auto retailers, Lithia Motors LAD, strengthened its foothold in the UK market with the acquisition of Pendragon PLC's UK motor and fleet management divisions, rebranding the latter as Pinewood Technologies Group PLC. The integration of Pendragon Vehicle Management and the adoption of Pinewood's technology position Lithia as a leading player in the UK automotive landscape, offering diversified solutions and unmatched advantages to competitors.\n\nElectric vehicle (EV) titan Tesla TSLA recalled 2.2 million vehicles in the United States over small font size in warning lights, heightening safety concerns.\n\nWhile OSK sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), GM carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). TSLA, LAD and GPI are currently #3 Ranked (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast Week\u2019s Top Stories\n\nGeneral Motors reported fourth-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12. The bottom line, however, decreased from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level of $2.12. Revenues of $42.98 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.78 billion but decreased from $43.1 billion recorded in the year-ago period. It recorded adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $1.75 billion, lower than $3.79 billion in the prior-year quarter. The automaker\u2019s share in the GM market was 8.5% in the reported quarter compared with 9.1% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nGeneral Motors had cash/cash equivalents of $18.85 billion as of Dec 31, 2023. The long-term automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $15.98 billion. The company recorded an adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.34 billion in fourth-quarter 2023. It declared its first-quarter dividend of 12 cents per share, marking a 35% increase from the prior payout. The dividend will be paid on Mar 14, 2024, to shareholders as of Mar 1, 2024.\n\nFor full-year 2024, GM expects adjusted EBIT in the range of $12-$14 billion. Adjusted EPS is anticipated in the range of $8.50-$9.50. Capex is predicted to be in the $10-$11 billion range. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is expected in the band of $8-$10 billion.\n\nTesla issued a recall for 2.2 million vehicles in the United States due to concerns regarding the font size of warning lights on the instrument panel. The small font size, particularly for brake, park, and antilock brake system warnings, poses readability challenges, potentially increasing the risk of accidents, as indicated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). This font size discrepancy is reported to be in violation of federal safety standards. The NHTSA announced the recall following a routine audit of Tesla vehicles.\n\nTesla stated no knowledge of any accidents or injuries resulting from this issue. The recall affects various models, including the Model S (2012-2023), Model X (2016-2024), Model 3 (2017-2023), Model Y (2019-2024), and 2024 Cybertruck vehicles. The company plans to address the problem through an over-the-air software update, eliminating the need for owners to visit a Tesla service center. Owner notification letters will be sent out starting Mar 30.\n\nIn a separate development, the NHTSA disclosed a preliminary evaluation concerning reports of power steering issues in certain Tesla vehicles on Thursday. Specifically, 2,388 complaints have been identified regarding steering control loss in select 2023 Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. Tesla has issued a number of recalls recently, targeting backup camera malfunctions and autopilot system flaws, following extensive investigations by the NHTSA into related incidents.\n\nLithia has acquired U.K. car dealership group Pendragon, solidifying its expansion into Britain and venturing into the dealership management system (DMS) sector. The deal, valued at nearly $500 million, marks a significant milestone for both companies. After a period of acquisition interest from various parties, Pendragon shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of Lithia's revised higher-priced offer. With the closure of the deal, Lithia owns Pendragon's 160 stores, predominantly new-car dealerships, along with its fleet business and a portion of its DMS company, Pinewood.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to add around $4.5 billion to Lithia\u2019s annualized revenues. This aligns with Lithia's ambitious goal of reaching $50 billion in annual revenues by the end of 2025, with acquisitions serving as a key strategy. Neil Williamson, Lithia's U.K. regional president, emphasized the strategic significance of the acquisition, underscoring the expanded footprint, brand portfolio, and technological advancements that position Lithia as a formidable player in the U.K. automotive industry. This move signifies Lithia's commitment to growth and innovation, solidifying its position as a leader in the global automotive market.\n\nPendragon is to be rebranded as Pinewood Technologies. This strategic move bolsters LAD's digital capabilities in the United Kingdom by incorporating Pinewood's technology platform across all locations and co-developing automotive solutions for the North American market. Pinewood Technologies will transition into a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business, enhancing its focus on dealer management software.\n\nGroup 1 reported fourth-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $9.50, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.49. The bottom line also decreased from the prior-year quarter\u2019s earnings of $10.86 per share. It registered net sales of $4.48 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.38 billion.

        "content": "EV industry stocks should be on your watchlist for 2024. If you are interested in the idea of a cleaner future while also growing your portfolio, these companies can help you achieve both goals.\n\nAlthough electric vehicles may have been overshadowed in the past year by artificial intelligence and other sectors, I still think there\u2019s plenty of room for these EV industry stocks to continue to deliver strong gains to investors. It\u2019s also important to remember that we\u2019re just at the very beginning of seeing their widespread adoption, so I think there\u2019s only a clear upside from here.\n\nHere are the best EV industry stocks for investors to consider for February.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFord (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord (NYSE:F) is a traditional automaker that is aggressively moving into the EV space. Although the company has made a slow and bumpy start into its entry into the market, it appears committed to making its presence felt in the market.\n\nIts commitment to the EV industry is evident in its investments in the EV segment. This includes $50 billion and aims for an 8% operating margin by the end of 2026 despite current negative margins. Also, in the same year, it expects a 2 million EV run rate despite facing a decrease in sales for models like the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning last year.\n\nIn the near term, the company is aiming for 600,000 EVs per year, a delay from the initial 2023 target\u200b, but it\u2019s still good news for investors who aim to hold Ford for the long term.\n\nTrading at just 7.94 times earnings, Ford is a buy considering its efforts to diversify into EVs and its solid commitment to the strategy.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Ford, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is investing in electric vehicles and is making a gradual pivot towards offering an all-electric range for consumers to enjoy.\n\nI feel that GM\u2019s trajectory is slightly more bullish than Ford\u2019s. This is because GM anticipates its EVs will be profitable by 2025, with federal subsidies helping substantially in the process. Initiatives such as Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Supercharger network will do wonders for smaller EV makers, too. Plans are in place that would let other manufacturers use the network so more consumers can charge their vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nGM is also committed to making its pivot success to EVs. The profits from combustion engine models are funding GM\u2019s transition to electric, with $11 billion to $13 billion in annual capital spending through 2025 planned.\n\nWall Street appears bullish on GM\u2019s outlook for the short term. There\u2019s a consensus upside of 29.35% for its stock price, to be reached within the next twelve months. It also has a \u201cBuy\u201d rating.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer that specializes in SUVs.\n\nLI stock is one of my favorite picks for investors who want to diversify away from non-U.S.-made EVs. The reason is that it has a huge presence in the Asian market, which is where I think a substantial amount of growth will come from in the future.\n\nThe company also has some huge plans. It\u2019s preparing to nearly triple its electric model lineup to 11 by 2025, up from four current models. This strategy also goes hand in hand with targeting mid and high-range models that are above $29,100 in value.\n\nMeanwhile, in China, LI stock is in the process of completing 300 high-speed supercharging stations, which should be done by the end of the year. There could be over 3,000 stations built by 2025.\n\nWall Street is expecting a huge surge in LI\u2019s revenues and EPS growth this year. Earnings are expected to climb by 91.30% in the coming year. This development would bring EPS up from $0.92 to $1.76 per share.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Several major companies, including five of the Magnificent Seven \u2014 Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT) \u2013 reported quarterly earnings this week. Yahoo Finance spoke to executives, experts, and analysts across the industry to break down everything investors need to know, including the winners and losers from this week's results.\n\nYahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer broke down the big earnings week ahead and what to expect from these mega-cap tech companies. Schafer said, \"Really, you're only missing Nvidia in terms of massive tech companies to report this week. And really I think the story here is understanding how big this is going to be for the overall market.\"\n\nGM (00:00:14)\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson discussed the results, EV adoption, and the company's growth plans.\n\nJacobson said, \"It was another year of overcoming a lot of challenges. As we think about 2024, it really is a year of execution. For us, we've got the roadmap. We talked about 200,000 to 300,000 EVs being produced this year.\"\n\nAlphabet (00:00:36)\n\nAlphabet reported better-than-expected revenue and profit, but ad revenue came in weaker than analyst estimates of $65.94 billion. Baird Technology Desk Sector Strategist Ted Mortonson provided insight into the results and the impacts of AI on Google and other tech companies.\n\nMortonson said, \"People are really focused on this move to generative AI and that seems to be a very big focus longer term for The Street, where Google has had basically a monopoly on search. With generative AI, you've got different players at least trying to dethrone them in some way.\"\n\nMicrosoft (00:00:52)\n\nMicrosoft's fiscal second-quarter earnings beat estimates, but Wall Street supposedly expected more from AI-driven revenue streams. Brent Bracelin, Piper Sandler Equity Research Analyst on Cloud, discussed the results and outlook for future revenues as generative AI turns roughly one-year-old in its adoption by tech giants.\n\nStory continues\n\nBracelin said, \"Generative AI is one-year-old. We're one year into this new AI cycle of Microsoft. They disclosed their AI business actually doubled sequentially. It's now a $4.4 billion run rate business in year one.\"\n\nStarbucks (00:01:10)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) released its latest quarterly earnings with results missing revenue expectations despite growing over 8% year-over-year. In addition, the company is cutting its original full-year guidance for 2024. Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri discussed the latest earnings report, what the company plans to change, and ongoing headwinds for the company.\n\nRuggeri said, \"We had a strong quarter in Q1, and it was really driven by our most loyal customers remaining engaged across the globe. And so as we think about going forward ... what we're really focused on is continuing to drive customers into our rewards program.\"\n\nBoeing (00:01:29)\n\nBoeing (BA) narrowed its fourth-quarter losses as outlined in its latest earnings results, but is withholding 2024 guidance amid questions surrounding the manufacturing of its 737 Max 9 jet series. Melius Research Managing Director of Aerospace, Defense & Space Robert Spingarn broke down the implications for Boeing.\n\nSpingarn said, \"The fact that there's no guide here isn't really a suspension so far as I can tell ... The FAA has asked for a freeze on the 737, arguably the most important product they do. And I think they're just being smart and not trying to get ahead of the regulator.\"\n\nNovo Nordisk (00:01:47)\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) reported a 36% surge in sales thanks to high demand for weight loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Novo Nordisk CFO Karsten Munk Knudsen discussed the company\u2019s results and what it has in store in the coming months.\n\nKnudsen said, \"We are really happy and very proud about the results we delivered this morning. Being able to grow the company by 36% is historic in our context and in an industrial context.\"\n\nQualcomm (00:02:08)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) posted its first-quarter earnings results, revealing a quarterly revenue of $9.94 billion, $6.69 billion of which came from its handsets division, a 16% increase year-over-year. Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Akash Palkhiwala discussed the chipmaker's performance, the current transition to AI-based tech, and China's economic environment.\n\nPalkhiwala said, \"When people buy a new phone, they're buying a more expensive phone. And so we are seeing this tremendous make shift towards more expensive devices, towards more expensive chips. And that shows up in our revenue growth.\"\n\nMeta (00:02:21)\n\nMeta Platforms outpaced Wall Street estimates for its fourth-quarter earnings, posting $40.1 billion in revenue and earnings of $5.33 per share. Seaport Global Analyst Aaron Kessler discussed Meta's earnings and its guidance around pivots into AI.\n\nKessler said, \"Obviously investors are going to like that showing continued expense discipline on their part. And so I think investors are really more focused on the guidance and the dividend for Meta.\"\n\nAmazon (00:02:36)\n\nAmazon reported its fourth-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street estimates with $170 billion in revenue versus an expected $166.2 billion. Wedbush Securities Managing Director Scott Devitt broke down the results and the performance of the online retailer's various segments and business properties.\n\nDevitt said, \"At $13.2 billion, which is what they did in the quarter, you have a trajectory that's leading the company towards kind of a 10% bogey in 2025 now, which is not something that investors were expecting.\"\n\nApple (00:02:50)\n\nApple's first-quarter earnings results blew past Wall Street estimates, posting over $119.5 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $2.18. However, net sales across Apple's categories and devices fell below expectations, particularly in its services and performance in China. Manhattan Venture Partners Head of Research Santosh Rao discussed Apple's sales miss and how Apple will proceed in generative AI investments.\n\nRao said, \"The number is a miss overall, but I think it's not a major disaster because it's all about the future here going forward, how they get the generative AI into their whole mix and all that. So there are a lot of other levers that they can pull, but at this point it is definitely a disappointment that two areas that we were concerned about did disappoint.\"",

        "content": "General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 14th of March to $0.12. Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 1.2% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns.\n\nWhile the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that General Motors' stock price has increased by 31% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield.\n\nSee our latest analysis for General Motors\n\nGeneral Motors' Dividend Is Well Covered By Earnings\n\nEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. However, General Motors' earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 21.2% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 3.3% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range. historic-dividend\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.20 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.48. This works out to be a decline of approximately 8.8% per year over that time. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for.\n\nGeneral Motors Could Grow Its Dividend\n\nGiven that the track record hasn't been stellar, we really want to see earnings per share growing over time. It's encouraging to see that General Motors has been growing its earnings per share at 8.9% a year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for General Motors' prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeneral Motors Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock\n\nIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.\n\nIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. As an example, we've identified 2 warning signs for General Motors that you should be aware of before investing. Is General Motors not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

        "content": "General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript January 30, 2024\n\nGeneral Motors Company beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $1.24, expectations were $1.12. General Motors Company\u00a0isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter\u00a0(see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good morning, and welcome to the General Motors Company Fourth Quarter and Calendar Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. During the open remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the open remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, January 30, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAshish Kohli: Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter and calendar year 2023. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. On today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\n\nThese risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the Safe Harbor Statements on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nMary Barra: Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. As we begin 2024, I believe GM is well positioned for a year of strong financial performance that builds on everything we accomplished and importantly learned in 2023. Consensus is growing that the US economy, the job market, and auto sales will continue to be resilient. At GM we expect healthy industry sales of about 16 million units. We have an unmatched ICE portfolio in North America, rising EV production on the LTM platform and GM Financial continues to perform well. We're building on a foundation of products that our customers love. In 2023, GM sold more vehicles in the US than anyone else. All of our US brands grew their sales year-over-year and gained US market share with healthy margins, thanks to stable pricing and incentives that were more than 20% below the industry average.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV had record sales. We led the industry in initial quality for the second year in a row according to J.D. Power. And we now have led the industry in combined pickup, full-size van, and full-size SUV sales for 10 consecutive years, making us the leader in the highest ATP quadrant of the market and helping us lead the commercial fleet market. And we have passed Honda and Toyota in the most affordable quadrant, thanks to attractive and profitable vehicles like the Chevrolet Trax, which is one of Car and Driver's 10 best trucks and SUVs, and the Buick Envista, which is winning with younger buyers. In fact, more than one in four Envista customers are between the ages of 18 and 35. The broad-based momentum we have today is important for our future because our customers are the most loyal in the industry.\n\nAll of this success contributed to full year EBIT-adjusted of $12.4 billion and adjusted auto-free cash flow of $11.7 billion in 2023, which brings our total to more than $22 billion for 2022 and 2023. Almost two-thirds of that cash is being returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including the impact of the $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we announced in November. Through the ASR, we immediately retired 215 million common shares in the fourth quarter. Our current share count is less than 1.2 billion and we are working to reduce this even further to less than 1 billion common shares outstanding, which would be about 600 million fewer than at our peak. As we look ahead, our priorities and our commitments are clear.\n\nThey are to maximize the opportunities we have with our winning ICE portfolio, grow our EV business profitably, deliver strong margins and cash flow, and refocus and relaunch crews. Across the enterprise, we are taking important steps to deliver on each priority. Let's start with our ICE portfolio. Chevrolet's crossover lineup had record sales last year, and this year we're enhancing two of its most important models which compete in growing segments. For example, Super Cruise will be available on the Traverse for the first time and we will introduce a new premium Z71 off-road model. The 2025 Chevrolet Equinox that we unveiled last week is another great example. It has more standard safety equipment, new truck-inspired styling, and a strong focus on technology.\n\nAnd importantly, both the Traverse and Equinox will have higher projected margins than the outgoing model. Buick and GMC are also launching new crossovers this year to keep our momentum going. In our EV business, we expect our US portfolio to be variable profit positive in the second half of the year based on our current expectations for EV demand and production growth. Strong interest in our vehicles, lower commodity prices and other factors will support this. Our plan is to produce in wholesale 200,000 to 300,000 Altium-based Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac and BrightDrop EVs in North America this year, but we will be guided by customer demand. It's true, the pace of EV growth has slowed, which has created some uncertainty. We will build to demand and we are encouraged that many third party forecasts have US EV deliveries rising from about 7% of the industry in 2023 to at least 10% in 2024, which would mean another year of record EV sales.\n\nWe believe our competitive position will improve throughout the year based on higher production of the Cadillac LYRIQ, the GMC Hummer EV, the Chevrolet Blazer EV, and the Silverado EV work truck. We're also excited to have the Chevrolet Equinox EV and the Silverado EV RST, the GMC Sierra EV Denali, and the Cadillac Escalade IQ arriving in showrooms over the course of the year. We are confident in the design and performance of these vehicles. For example, the LYRIQ is driving growth at Cadillac. Its sales have increased sequentially every month since September and January deliveries should be in line with December despite winter storms across the country. We also have more than 10,000 -- excuse me, 100,000 reservations and orders for EV pickups that we expect to fulfill in 2024 and 2025.\n\nHowever, if demand conditions change, we'll take advantage of our manufacturing flexibility in Spring Hill and Ramos to build more ICE models and fewer EVs. We can also mix between different EV products at Factory ZERO. Ultimately, we will follow the customer. The supply chain, manufacturing, and software changes we have made will support our growth. On the battery front, our Ultium Cells joint venture is at full production in Ohio, and the new plant in Tennessee will begin shipping cells this quarter. In addition, our supply chain team has moved very quickly to resource two minor cell components after the US Treasury published its updated IRA guidelines in December. This change means that new production going forward of the Chevrolet Blazer EV and the Cadillac LYRIQ will qualify for the full $7,500 consumer credit.\n\nWe work closely with our dealers to ensure consistent pricing for our customers, which we estimate will impact no more than about 25,000 vehicles. Our battery module production is on schedule. The team has improved the automated equipment at our assembly plant used to build modules and installation of new high capacity assembly lines should be complete by mid-year. Our software and services team is also in the process of resolving the stability issues some customers have experienced with the Chevrolet Blazer EV that impacted their screens and charging experience. And they are working with a huge sense of urgency to lift the stop sales soon. We disappointed these customers and we know it. We are determined to get the software right and we will.\n\nWe have made several organizational and process improvements that will help us deliver the best possible customer experience going forward. Among several important organizational realignments, we established a software quality division within the software and services team that has been performing a retrospective on the Blazer EV and has improved the current software development and test processes across the enterprise. Outcomes of this activity are getting applied to all programs going forward and they include improved standardization of the software development and release process, increased focus on test automation at the vehicle level, and additional quality gates and metrics for software at the vehicle level. From a margin and cash flow perspective, we are making good progress on cost reduction and capital efficiency.\n\nCompared with 2022, our fixed cost net of depreciation and amortization will be down $2 billion as we exit 2024, which will offset the higher impact -- the impact of higher labor costs. We are also beginning to see savings from winning with simplicity, and all of our current and future programs have embraced this very important way of designing products. Each team is responsible for creating trim series that make vehicles easy to order with the content customers want and far fewer standalone options. By making more equipment standard in trim series with logical price swaps, we can eliminate literally thousands of unique part numbers and dozens of software releases. For example, we have eliminated over 1,000 selectable options across our current and near-term product programs, which is reducing hardware, software, ordering and manufacturing complexity, and importantly, all the costs associated with them.\n\nIn 2024, the savings are expected to be about $200 million. To be clear, we're talking about $200 million of savings to execute the same product plan. These savings will grow over time as we apply the discipline to future products like our next generation full-size pickups. We're also continuing to balance capital priorities and consistent free cash flow generation. We expect that our 2024 capital spending will be in the $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, which is roughly flat year-over-year and down considerably from the $13 billion top of our end initial 2023 guidance. Our forward plans include bringing our plug-in hybrid technology to select vehicles in North America. Let me be clear, GM remains committed to eliminating tailpipe emissions from our light duty vehicles by 2035.\n\nBut in the interim, deploying plug-in technology in strategic segments will deliver some of the environmental benefits of EVs as the nation continues to build its charging infrastructure. We are timing the launches to help us comply with the more stringent fuel economy and tailpipe emission standards that are being proposed. And we plan to deliver the program in a capital and cost-efficient way because the technology is already in production in other markets. We'll have more to share about this down the road. Moving to Cruise. Last week we released the results of the third-party reviews and we've already begun to implement significant changes to build a better Cruise. We are committed to earning back the trust with our regulators and the public through our actions. A group of technicians in a garage, inspecting car parts and ensuring safety compliance.\n\nOur plan 2024 investment in Cruise reflects our more deliberate and cadence go-to-market strategy and we are developing new financial targets and a new roadmap. Spending will be down considerably this year, but we will continue to invest in the people who are advancing the software, specialized hardware, and AI capabilities. This reflects our commitment to our vision, which is to deliver the safety benefits of self-driving technology and a scalable, profitable business. I look forward to sharing our timetable for returning Cruise EVs to the road soon. To summarize, we learned a lot in 2023, and those learnings are helping us build our strengths and addressing our challenges. Everyone on the team is committed to building on our momentum and creating shareholding value.\n\nYou'll see in our proxy statement this spring, executive compensation is tied even more closely to delivering our comprehensive ICE, EV, AV, and software plans, while meeting our financial targets. So our goals are truly aligned with yours. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I would like to share some thoughts about our next Investor Day. Because of the significant changes that are underway at GM and Cruise, we think it makes sense to wait until later in the year to host an event. This will give our software team the time to focus on software for our upcoming launches, and we will be able to share more tangible proof points on all four pillars of our strategy, ICE, EV, AV, and software. When we do get together, we will show you what we've done, not just tell you what we're going to do.\n\nIn the meantime, we've already provided a roadmap for EV profitability in 2025, and we'll share updates on Cruise as we finalize the technology and relaunch plans. With that, I'll turn it over to Paul to go through our 2023 financials and provide more details on our 2024 outlook. Then we'll take your questions.\n\nPaul Jacobson: Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you all joining us this morning. I'd like to begin by recognizing the entire GM team for what they accomplished in 2023. When you look back over the last couple of years, the results show an impressive trend in revenue growth, EPS consistency, and cash generation. For the full year, our EBIT-adjusted of $12.4 billion came in slightly above the midpoint of the range we guided to in November, thanks to the continued strength of the core business. We grew revenue by 10% year-over-year to a record $172 billion and generated $7.68 of EPS diluted adjustments. A key focus has been profitable growth. And for the full year, we demonstrated this by growing U.S. market share by 30 basis points, while keeping incentives well below industry averages.\n\nIt's important to mention the 2023 actions we've taken to reduce fixed costs and the progress made on the $2 billion net cost reduction program. For example, automotive engineering was reduced by $400 million, driven by portfolio simplification, realizing the benefits from winning with simplicity as well as our drive to virtual engineering. Marketing spend was reduced by $500 million and we expect another $400 million this year. And we saw approximately $500 million from lower BrightDrop and other growth business spend, along with the impact of the voluntary separation program across the enterprise. These $1.4 billion of fixed cost reductions were partially offset by $400 million of higher depreciation and amortization, meeting our target to achieve half of the $2 billion program in 2023.\n\nWe began 2023 with $24 billion of auto cash and marketable securities, generated full year adjusted auto-free cash flow of $11.7 billion, and returned approximately $12 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including the impact of the $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program initiated in Q4. Coming into 2024, we are well positioned with roughly $20 billion of auto cash and marketable securities and will appropriately balance our capital allocation priorities with the plan to continue to return capital to our shareholder through repurchases and our new higher dividend rate. Let's get into Q4 results. Total company revenue was $43 billion, consistent year-over-year, despite the impact of the strike. However, we did have a number of cost items that we do not expect to reoccur in 2024 that impacted our margin performance in the quarter.\n\nWe achieved $1.8 billion in EBIT adjusted, 4.1% EBIT adjusted margins, and $1.24 in EPS diluted adjusted. These results were also impacted by the strike, which had a $900 million EBIT adjusted impact in Q4 and a $1.1 billion impact for the full year, primarily from losing an estimated 95,000 units of production. Additionally, we increased our inventory valuation allowances by $1.1 billion to remeasure battery cell and EV inventory held at year end. This adjustment was significantly larger in Q4 versus prior quarters, driven by a combination of increasing cell production in preparation for our 2024 EV acceleration and holding more EVs in company inventory. Adjustments for the full year totaled $1.7 billion. We expect this to be substantially lower in 2024 as we continue to make progress toward our EBIT margin targets on EVs. North America delivered Q4 EBIT-adjusted of $2 billion, down $1.6 billion year-over-year, driven primarily by the $900 million strike impact and $1 billion of inventory adjustments I just discussed.\n\nThe performance was also driven by higher pricing and lower fixed costs, which more than offset mixed headwinds. North America margin of 8.7% was within our targeted 8% to 10% range for the full year and included a 1.6 percentage point impact from the strike and the inventory adjustments. Part of this performance is from proactively managing our inventory levels, helping to minimize incentives. I'm pleased that we ended the year at 50 days of U.S. inventory, which is at the low end of our 50 to 60 day target range, and incentives that were more than 20% below the industry average. GM International had another solid quarter with Q4 EBIT-adjusted of $300 million, which was consistent year-over-year. I want to thank the entire international team for another year of good execution and delivering $1.2 billion of EBIT adjusted.\n\nGM Financial also performed well with Q4 EBIT-adjusted of $700 million. down slightly year-over-year. Full year results were $3 billion at the top end of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion guidance range. Portfolio credit metrics continue to be strong, in part due to a predominantly prime credit mix with net charge off up slightly due to moderation in credit performance. GM financial has consistently been an integral part of the business supporting our customers, supporting our dealers and paying dividends of $1.8 billion to GM in 2023. Cruise expenses were $800 million in the quarter, up $300 million year-over-year and similar to the spend level in Q3. So let's look ahead to 2024. We expect EBIT-adjusted in the $12 billion to $14 billion range.\n\nEPS diluted adjusted to be in the $8.50 to $9.50 range, including an estimated $1.45 per share benefit from last year's accelerated share repurchase based on the current share price, which will be partially offset by roughly $0.50 headwind from a higher tax rate and lower interest income on lower cash balances, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $8 billion, $10 billion range for the year. I want to summarize a few items in 2023 that we don't expect to repeat and will help to contribute to our higher outlook for this year despite some of the potential macro headwinds. These include the $800 million EBIT-adjusted impact from the LG agreements. And as a reminder, this will save us an additional $1,000 per vehicle going forward on our path to EV profitability.\n\n$1.1 billion EBIT adjusted impact from the strike and a substantial amount of the $1.7 billion of net realizable value adjustments as we work through the sell inventory, improve EV profitability, and benefit from lower lithium prices. In light of the current macro environment, we anticipate a market similar to 2023 with total US industry volumes of around 16 million units. We expect wholesale volume to grow as we rebound from the impact of the strike and continue our track record of market share gains, primarily from higher EV volumes. However, we do assume mixed headwinds from our ICE production driven by anticipated actions to proactively manage full size truck inventory levels. We also assume a 2% to 2.5% pricing headwind year-over-year, but overall we remain confident in our ability to balance production, inventory levels and profitability, while growing revenues and sustain our North America margins in the 8% to 10% range.\n\nWe are on track to realize the remaining $1 billion of net fixed cost savings with the benefits coming from similar areas to last year, including marketing, engineering, and the full year benefit of the actions we took in 2023. We expect $1.3 billion in higher labor costs, along with logistics being a slight headwind year-over-year, primarily driven by higher finished vehicle shipping costs. Cruise expenses are expected to be around $1 billion lower, given the new operational plan Mary mentioned earlier. In November we gave an update on our path to EV profitability with an estimated EBIT margin improvement of more than 60 percentage points and a lower overall EV loss in 2024 compared to 2023, even when you exclude the impact of the inventory adjustments.\n\nThis will largely be driven by higher EV volumes and fixed cost leverage from both EV and battery cell manufacturing, along with the benefit of all of our North America volume being on the Ultium platform. We are already seeing an improvement in cell cost today, driven by significantly lower raw materials prices and better pricing on cells produced at our first battery JV plant from higher capacity utilization. For GM International, we expect relative stability in our South America and Middle East operations, however, we anticipate ongoing pressure in China, including the plan to reduce production in Q1 to balance dealer inventory levels. These actions will likely result in Q1 China equity income being a slight loss, with a return to profitability starting in Q2.\n\nFor GM Financial, we expect EBIT-adjusted again in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range with credit performance and used vehicle prices returning to normal throughout the year, along with earning asset growth from retail loan originations and the commercial loan portfolio. We are forecasting another year of robust automotive adjusted free cash flow, but we anticipate modest year-over-year headwinds from 2023 working capital benefits that we assume will not repeat and the timing of payments associated with accruals recognized last year. For example, warranty, tax, and higher assumed inventory levels. From a modeling perspective, remember that Q1 is our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter of the year. We expect our capital spend to be similar to 2023, inclusive of $500 million to $1 billion of investments in our battery JVs. Our 2024 effective tax rate is assumed to be in the range of 18% to 20%, up from last year, primarily due to the global mix of earnings and lower R&D credits primarily due to lower Cruise spend.\n\nAnd our full year EPS guidance assumes the weighted-average fully diluted share count of slightly below 1.15 billion shares. This includes the impact of the remaining shares to be purchased through the ASR, which we expect will reduce our fully diluted share count to below 1.1 billion shares once completed. The actual share count will depend on several factors that impact the final ASR settlement, including the average share price during execution and excludes the impact of any incremental share repurchases beyond the ASR. In closing, we know the EV market is not going to grow linearly and we are prepared to flex between ICE and EV production, given our unique manufacturing capabilities to balance inventory levels and to build customer demand.\n\nThis will help support pricing and our continued incentive discipline. While we have faced some challenges in our EV transition, we are actively working to address them and remain excited about our future and look forward to a successful 2024. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nSee also 20 Highest Quality Fabrics in the World and 15 Cheapest Countries to Get Permanent Residency Heading into 2024.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is undergoing a reset in 2024. Shares are down 22% after just a month of trading as the electric vehicle maker dialed back expectations for growth. It says this year won\u2019t be able to keep pace with what investors saw last year.\u00a0As overall EV demand weakens, a Tesla stock analysis indicates the carmaker is in a tough spot.\n\nPrice cuts aren\u2019t boosting sales which will lead to further margin erosion. Inventory is rising and profits are taking a hit. Yet with the stock now tumbling to under $200 a share is this the time to buy in? Let\u2019s see whether this is a great opportunity for long-term investors or if there is still further to fall.\n\nA Tesla Stock Analysis\n\nCEO Elon Musk told analysts, \u201cTesla is currently between two major growth waves.\u201d The first one was the release of the Model 3 and Y globally which allowed Tesla to set production and delivery records.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow it\u2019s in a lull. The next wave won\u2019t start until it releases its next-generation vehicle. And because Tesla is focusing on that iteration, volume growth will be lower in 2024. Maybe beyond.\n\nThe EV industry is experiencing growing pains. While much of that was because of rampant inflation that jacked up the cost of everything, including EV prices, manufacturers priced themselves out of the market of what consumers could afford.\n\nThe price cuts by Tesla and other EV makers helped narrow the gap considerably. Government subsidies in the form of tax credits have virtually eliminated any difference. The average cost of a new EV is just under $51,000 while the average gas-powered vehicle is $48,000.\u00a0That\u2019s still expensive, no matter which way you go.\n\nConsumers are also unimpressed with the limitations of EVs whether it\u2019s distance on a single charge, the need for more charging stations, or the difficulty of charging EVs in cold weather.\n\nIt\u2019s slowing EV sales growth. Cox Automotive says EVs accounted for 3.2% of all vehicles in 2021 and grew to 5.6% in 2022, a 2.6% increase. Although EVs now represent over 7% of all vehicles sold, the growth rate was just 1.8% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe EV Market Evolved\n\nMany buyers believe a hybrid vehicle is the preferable option. A record 1 million-plus hybrid vehicles were sold last year, a 76% increase from 2022. Unlike U.S. automakers, Toyota (NYSE:TM) presciently saw going all-in was not a smart option.\n\nInstead, it invested across the full spectrum of energy options: fossil fuels and EVs, especially in its hybrid vehicles. Quarterly profits doubled.\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F) both made big bets on full-electrics and are paying the price. General Motors gave up on selling 400,000 EVs by the middle of this year while Ford canceled or postponed investments totalling $12 billion for EVs.\n\nFord, though, is the second-biggest hybrid manufacturer behind Toyota. It plans on producing enough hybrids to quadruple sales within five years. Now GM is planning on including plug-in hybrids in its product lineup.\n\nThis puts Tesla in a tight spot. As the leading EV maker, any industry slowdown is going to show up in its sales numbers. Plus it sounds like it\u2019s not even really trying at the moment. Instead it is betting on its next-generation EV to move the needle.\n\nInvestors Should Plug in Elsewhere\n\nInvestors are better served waiting for that to happen because there\u2019s no guarantee it will happen. Tesla EVs are a modern marvel and the technology packed into them is awe-inspiring. But we\u2019ve moved beyond the early adopter phase.\n\nMost everyone who really wanted an EV has one. Now manufacturers, including Tesla, need to convince the rest of the buying public EVs truly are the future.\n\nPricey, new, gizmo-filled vehicles aren\u2019t necessarily it. Besides new cars, Tesla may find its Cybertruck is a no-go. Demand for a pickup truck whose base price starts at $60,000 will be weak.\u00a0Ford recently cut production of its Lightning F-150 pickup.\n\nMusk has the right idea in one respect to cut the prices of his cars to make them more affordable. But until they\u2019re at a price point where the masses can afford them, Tesla faces a bumpy road. TSLA stock trading at 44 times earnings, 6 times sales, and well over 100x free cash flow at a time the EV maker is facing even stronger headwinds says this is not a time to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Demand for electric vehicles (EVs) remains price-sensitive, but there\u2019s a notable improvement in potential demand retention \u2014 the percentage of respondents considering an EV at higher price points. That metric, along with the potential revenue pool (demand retention multiplied by adjusted price), has strengthened. In this piece, we look at solid EV options trades to ride the global EV adoption trend.\n\nAccording to Citi (NYSE:C), 65% of current new vehicle owners considered buying an EV in 2023, up from 59% in 2022. There\u2019s also an increase in EV consideration among leases and an even faster growth rate among cash or loan buyers.\n\nDespite lagging behind other regions, the U.S. market shows potential for a rapid increase in EV demand. This potential is supported by the country\u2019s high vehicle density \u2014 the highest globally \u2014 and the growing popularity of EVs, not just for their electric nature but also for advanced features like connectivity and over-the-air software updates.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGlobally, Citi\u2019s assessment predicts higher plug-in hybrid (PHEV) penetration in China, a slightly lower U.S. EV penetration through 2030, stronger EV adoption in Europe and a modest increase in EV penetration in China, Europe and the U.S. by 2025.\n\nRivian (RIVN) rivn stock sign outside the company's HQ in Silicon Valley\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nRivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is positioning itself as a formidable competitor to industry giants like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM). The year 2023 ended positively for Rivian, particularly with the growing interest in electric pickup trucks, buoyed by the initial deliveries of Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck.\n\nHowever, the beginning of 2024 brought challenges, with RIVN shares experiencing a rapid decline amid weakening EV sentiment. Rivian is scheduled to announce its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings and revenue on February 21. Wall Street is predicting a loss of $1.34 per share, an improvement from the $1.73 per share loss in 2022. Expectations are also set for the Q4 revenue to reach $1.32 billion, potentially doubling its previous figures.\n\nStory continues\n\nBack in December 2023, Baird recognized RIVN as a \u201cbest idea\u201d for 2024, citing the company\u2019s continued demand-supply constraints, which have lasted longer than many of its peers in the EV sector. Baird\u2019s analysis suggested Rivian is poised for a strong performance in 2024.\n\n\u201cProduction improvements, the use of inhouse developed components, and streamlining supply chain relationships are levers for margin upside, and we expect RIVN to flip to gross margin positive in Q424,\u201d Baird analysts said in a note.\n\nWith its shares down 28% year-to-date (YTD), Rivian could rebound sharply as EV market sentiment improves. That is why investors should consider RIVN as one of the EV options trades for 2024.\n\nThe open interest for Rivian\u2019s options has seen a slight increase of 0.9%, reaching 1.5 million contracts. That figure is notably higher than the 52-week average of 1.4 million contracts. The open interest percentile rank currently stands at 60%, indicating current open interest has exceeded 40% of the time over the past year.\n\nNio (NIO) NIO logo and the Nio's user center, NIO House. Retail display of store at downtown LCM mall daytime NIO is a Chinese electric car brand sales person and customers inside\n\nSource: Andy Feng / Shutterstock.com\n\nNio (NYSE:NIO) is another beaten-down EV stock, down 35.5% YTD. Shares have been trading lower in recent months amid concerns over potentially higher operating expenses, which could affect the company\u2019s outlook.\n\nThe EV maker, facing intense competition in the market, may need to reduce prices on its existing models and increase marketing expenditures to successfully launch its second and third brands. That strategy is particularly pertinent for the introduction of the ET9, the newest addition to NIO\u2019s product line.\n\nThe ET9, priced at $112,000, is a high-end sedan equipped with a 900-volt electrical system and capable of charging speeds up to 600kW. However, customers will have to wait for this model, as deliveries likely won\u2019t begin until early 2025.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are positive aspects for the company. Notably, there is an optimistic sales volume outlook for the end of this year and into 2025. Additionally, the company has secured a significant financial boost with a $2.2 billion investment from Abu Dhabi\u2019s CYVN Holdings.\n\nThe improved liquidity situation is likely to mitigate investor concerns about the EV marker\u2019s financial situation. Moreover, the Chinese government has pledged to support its embattled stock market, which may boost China-based companies listed overseas, like Nio.\n\nNio\u2019s option open interest has risen by 1.7% to 2.2 million contracts, surpassing the 52-week average of 1.9 million contracts. The current percentile rank of open interest\u2014a key metric when gauging the sentiment of open interest \u2014 at 84% \u2014 suggesting Nio\u2019s open interest was higher only on 16% of the days in the past year. That indicates an unusually high demand for trading and holding options in Nio.\n\nWith the stock trading below $6, NIO could easily return to trade above $10 a share \u2014 levels last seen in September 2023. Recently reports show that traders are increasingly targeting Nio stock.\n\nBYD (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) made headlines across the globe recently after the Asian EV maker surpassed Tesla to become the world\u2019s largest electric car manufacturer in the last quarter of 2023. That achievement underscores the rapid growth and expanding influence of China\u2019s EV sector.\n\nAccording to a stock exchange filing, BYD set a record by selling 526,000 battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in the quarter ending on December 31, 2023. In comparison, Tesla, led by Elon Musk, delivered 484,500 vehicles in the same period, a record for the company.\n\nOver the entire year, Tesla maintained its lead with 1.8 million electric car sales. BYD, however, was not far behind, with 1.57 million electric vehicles sold, marking a substantial 73% increase from 2022. Additionally, BYD sold 1.44 million hybrid vehicles.\n\nMoreover, Tesla\u2019s lead over BYD narrowed significantly in 2023, standing at about 230,000 units, compared to a 400,000 unit difference in 2022. For many, BYD\u2019s success, backed by investor Warren Buffett, symbolizes the rapid advancement of China\u2019s EV industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the current stock market investment trends, and go directly to read 5 Best Low Cost Stocks To Buy Under $75.\n\nThe latest economic indicators suggest that the US economy remains resilient and is in better shape than anticipated, defying concerns of a recession. According to the Commerce Department's report on economic growth, the US economy expanded by 3.1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by robust consumer spending on healthcare, dining out, and automobiles. Additionally, holiday season sales surpassed expectations, reaching $964.4 billion during November and December, according to data from the National Retail Federation.\n\nThe strength of the US economy, coupled with the possibility of future rate cuts, has emboldened market bulls to make more optimistic predictions and set higher targets for the S&P 500. For instance, Katie Stockon, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, suggested on CNBC that the S&P 500 could potentially reach 6,100 in the long term if new highs are achieved. Despite some stocks being overbought, Stockon noted signs of strength in the market, indicating the beginning of a bull market. Furthermore, Lori Calvasina from RBC Capital Markets remarked in December that while the market is expected to grow gradually in the second half of 2024, investors may need to pause to digest the significant gains witnessed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nIn such an environment, potential investors looking to dip their feet in the stock market often seek out low-cost yet potentially lucrative stocks to navigate the world of finance. While these stocks may not provide the same level of security as mega-cap firms like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), they offer the potential for decent short-term returns due to their volatility. In this context, some of the best cheap stocks to buy include CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), along with others listed below.\n\nStory continues 15 Best low cost Stocks To Buy Under $75\n\nA trader on the floor of a bustling stock exchange, surrounded by a sea of monitors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used stock screeners to shortlist stocks that were trading at a share price of less than $75. The compilation of cheap stocks is derived from their popularity among the 910 hedge funds monitored by Insider Monkey. The roster of 15 best cheap stocks to buy under $75 is organized in ascending order based on the count of hedge funds that held each stock. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years\u00a0(see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n15. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)\n\nShare Price as of January 27: $46.30\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 41\n\nThe Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), commonly known as Kroger, is a prominent American retail corporation operating an extensive network of supermarkets and multi-department stores across 35 states in the United States. With a presence in over 2,700 supermarkets and multi-department stores, The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) holds a significant position in the global food retail industry.\n\nKroger Co (NYSE:KR) disclosed its third-quarter financial results earlier in November of 2023. The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.95 for the period, surpassing expectations by $0.03. Additionally, the reported revenue stood at $33.96 billion, exceeding estimates by $60 million.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 41 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had investments in The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), representing a slight decline from 43 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes amounted to over $3.13 billion.\n\nOakmark Funds funds mentioned The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter.\u00a0Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n\u201cThe Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is the second-largest grocery retailer in America behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger\u2019s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery. However, we believe the company\u2019s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year\u2019s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger\u2019s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return approximately 25% of its market cap to shareholders.\u201d\n\nMuch like CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) ranks as one of the best cheap stocks to buy.\n\n14. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)\n\nShare Price as of January 27: $55.44\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\n\nMonster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) is a U.S.-based company that focuses on creating, promoting, selling, and distributing energy drink beverages and concentrates. Ranking as one of the best cheap stocks to buy, it features well-known brands such as Monster Energy, Relentless, and Burn. On November 13, financial firm Jefferies began coverage of Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) stock with a Buy rating and set a price target of $65. The analysis highlighted the robustness of the company\u2019s core business. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, 42 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.05 billion in Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), compared to 44 in the preceding quarter worth $1.19 billion.\n\n13. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)\n\nShare Price as of January 27: $11.38\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 43\n\nHeadquartered in Dearborn, Michigan, United States, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) stands as an American multinational automobile manufacturer, specializing in the sale of automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand, while luxury cars are marketed under the distinguished Lincoln brand. Earlier this month, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) reported its domestic sales volumes for the fourth quarter, revealing record numbers in electric vehicle (EV) sales. The company sold 25,937 EVs during the period, marking a notable 24% year-over-year growth.\n\nOn November 1, Barclays upgraded the rating of Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) stock to Overweight and maintained a $14 price target. Analyst Dan Levy highlighted the stock's historically cheap valuation, suggesting the potential for an attractive upside in the event of a modest reversal of sharply negative sentiment.\n\nAs of Q3 2023, 43 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held shares of Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), with a total valuation of $1.3 billion. Among them, Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management emerged as the largest hedge fund shareholder, owning 55.6 million shares valued at $691 million.\n\n12.

The company reported a 5% year-on-year increase in total revenues, reaching $3.3 billion. Additionally, there was a significant 75% year-on-year reduction in net loss, amounting to $144 million.

Tiger Global Management LLC emerged as the leading hedge fund, owning 11.7 million shares valued at $514 million.\n\n11. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nShare Price as of January 27: $59.40\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 57\n\nHighly regarded as one of the best cheap stocks to buy, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a renowned multinational American corporation celebrated for producing the iconic beverage, Coca-Cola.

In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform. CAR-T is a cell therapy that activates the body\u2019s immune system to target cancers. This will be a key growth vector alongside M&A in overcoming the company\u2019s patent cliff.\u201d\n\n8.

        "title": "3 Standout Stocks That Crushed Q4 Earnings Estimates",
        "content": "Earnings season rolled on with corporate results issued at a fast clip. Overall, results continue to trend in a positive direction. With 25% of S&P 500-listed companies having released financial results for the final months of 2023, 69% have beaten profit expectations and 68% have reported better-than-expected revenue figures, according to data from FactSet. Among the prints issued to date, there have been some big misses and big beats. Stock prices have risen or fallen by as much as 20% in a single trading day, depending on whether a company exceeded or missed analyst forecasts for its financial results. That demonstrates the power earnings season has on individual stocks and the market as a whole. Investors can expect more highs and lows in the weeks ahead as we continue moving through Q4 2023 earnings. Here are three standout stocks crushing Q4 earnings estimates.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) issued a very strong fourth quarter that crushed Wall Street forecasts, sending its share price up 8%. The Q4 beat was surprising coming in as it did months after the Detroit automaker endured a six-week strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union that disrupted operations and cost it billions of dollars in lost productivity. Still, GM reported Q4 2023 earnings per share (EPS) of $1.24 versus $1.16, the consensus expectation of analysts.\n\nRevenue came in at $42.98 billion versus the $38.67 billion estimated. Sales at the company were flat from a year earlier. Looking ahead, General Motors also issued strong guidance, saying it expects EPS of $8.50 to $9.50 and free cash flow of $8 billion to $10 billion for all of 2024. The earnings guidance is better than the company\u2019s 2023 results and higher than Wall Street forecasts that called for flat results this year. GM stock has now gained 39% over the last three months and is on an upswing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStory continues\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) got the attention of investors by reporting a surprise profit for Q4 2023 as sales of its COVID-19 medications performed better than expected. The drug maker reported Q4 EPS of 10 cents, which was much better than a loss of 22 cents expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $14.25 billion versus $14.42 billion forecasted on Wall Street. Overall sales were down 41% from a year earlier, but the result was not nearly as bad as feared.\n\nPfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine sales totaled $5.36 billion in Q4, down 53% from a year earlier but better than the $4.99 billion estimated by analysts tracking the company\u2019s progress. Pfizer has struggled with a sharp decline in its COVID-19 business as infection rates around the world dwindle. However, gazing forward, the pharmaceutical company reiterated its full-year 2024 guidance that calls for revenue of $58.50 billion to $61.50 billion. Pfizer said it expects 2024 earnings of $2.05 to $2.25 per share.\n\nPfizer added in its earnings release that it hopes its $43 billion acquisition of cancer drug maker Seagen, which closed during Q4, will restore investor confidence in the company. PFE stock has declined 37% in the last 12 months.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of credit card giant American Express (NYSE:AXP) also got a big boost, rising 7% after it issued financial results that crushed Q4 earnings estimates and announced that it is raising its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by 17%. For Q4 2023, American Express reported EPS of $2.62. That missed Wall Street forecasts of $2.64. Revenue of $15.80 billion was below estimates that called for $16 billion in sales. However, the misses were due to total provisions set aside for credit losses of $1.44 billion in Q4.\n\nIn terms of guidance, American Express offered a sunny outlook for 2024, saying that it expects revenue growth of 9% to 11% and EPS of $12.65 to $13.15. That was better than the earnings outlook of $12.38 a share expected on Wall Street. AXP stock also got a boost from news that American Express will pay a dividend of 70 cents a share, up 17% from 60 cents previously. The increased dividend payout will begin with the first quarter 2024 dividend declaration, the company said. AXP stock is up 17% in the last year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "*\n\nFormula One rejects Andretti bid to enter in 2025\n\n*\n\nU.S.-based team had sought a slot with GM backing\n\n*\n\nF1 holds open possibility of 2028 entry\n\n(10 Adds details, quotes)\n\nBy Alan Baldwin\n\nLONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Formula One on Wednesday rejected an Andretti-Cadillac bid to enter as an 11th team in 2025, saying it did not believe the proposed outfit would be competitive or add value to the championship.\n\nIt said, however, that it would look differently on an application for 2028 with a General Motors power unit \"either as a GM works team or as a GM customer team designing all allowable components in-house\".\n\nThe governing FIA last year approved Andretti's application and sent it on to Liberty Media-owned Formula One Management (FOM) last October for commercial discussions.\n\nThe existing teams had opposed expanding the grid, a move they argued would reduce their value and dilute their share of the revenues.\n\n\"Our assessment process has established that the presence of an 11th team would not, on its own, provide value to the Championship,\" Formula One said.\n\n\"The most significant way in which a new entrant would bring value is by being competitive. We do not believe that the Applicant would be a competitive participant.\"\n\nFormula One said it did not believe there was a basis for any new applicant to be admitted in 2025 \"given that this would involve a novice entrant building two completely different cars in its first two years of existence\".\n\n\"The fact that the Applicant proposes to do so gives us reason to question their understanding of the scope of the challenge involved.\"\n\nFormula One's engine rules are changing significantly in 2026 and an Andretti entry would have relied on an obligation for one of the existing manufacturers to supply them until at least 2028.\n\nGeneral Motors has\n\nformally registered\n\nwith the FIA to provide power units for the proposed U.S.-based team but only from 2028.\n\nFormula One said the initial 'dependency' on a compulsory power unit supply led it to believe the proposed team would not be competitive.

        "content": "Investors who buy small-cap stocks usually want to hit \u201chome runs.\u201d In other words, they want to make huge amounts of money. One way to accomplish that goal is by choosing names that Wall Street is falling in love with, as seen in the huge, recent gains in stock prices. Equities undergoing such rallies are often referred to as \u201chot stocks.\u201d As always, it\u2019s important to choose companies that can capitalize on strong, ongoing trends and show evidence of having top-notch products. By finding hot small-cap stocks that meet these criteria, investors can, in the words of Investopedia, find the \u201clarge-cap stocks of the future.\u201d With all that said, here are three hot small-cap stocks for January 2024.\n\nAmerican Superconductor (AMSC) A wind turbine appears in silhouette against a bright orange and blue sky.\n\nSource: Khanthachai C / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC) stock has been on fire since the company reported a 65% YOY revenue surge last quarter. Specifically, AMSC has jumped 40% since it released its quarterly results.\n\nMoreover, the company\u2019s net income, excluding certain items, came in at $900,00, way better than the adjusted loss of $7.7 million during the same period a year earlier. Also noteworthy is that it generated positive cash flow of $1.3 million during the quarter.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMSC\u2019s powerful rebound was mostly enabled by the rapidly rising revenue of its power grid unit, Gridtec. The unit\u2019s revenue climbed to $33.6 million last quarter from $20.8 million a year earlier. The unit\u2019s sales are generated by products that ensure smooth, uninterrupted utility flow, even with renewable energy sources present.\n\nBut AMSC also produces and globally distributes wind turbines. Its Windtec unit is beginning to rebound thanks to its key customer, Inox Wind, ramping up its wind turbine installation. AMSC\u2019s wind revenue climbed to $5.75 million last quarter.\n\nIn the company\u2019s recent earnings call, CEO Daniel McGahn was very bullish on Gridtec and Windtec. He was also optimistic on the demand for the firm\u2019s products being used by the U.S. Navy to combat mines.

In fact, IBATF\u2019s plant operates on less than three acres.\n\nThe shares have been on a tear since the firm recently reported that it had leased the plant to a \u201csignificant producer of metals and minerals.\u201d Since then, the stock has jumped almost 50%.\n\nThe plant is slated to generate 4,000 tons of lithium annually when it begins operations in Q2, and International Battery Metals will receive royalties on the plant\u2019s lithium production. Eventually the lessee has the option to buy the plant, but International Battery Metals would keep the rights to the technology. This unique deal makes IBATF one of the top hot small-cap stocks for January 2024.\n\nMany other major companies, including Albemarle (NYSE:ALB), Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) have tried to develop DLE technology but none have commercialized it yet.\n\nInternational Battery\u2019s market capitalization is $190 million.\n\nRumble (RUM) A woman in a pink jacket sits at a table inside while filming herself on camera\n\nSource: garetsworkshop / Shutterstock\n\nRumble (NASDAQ:RUM) operates an internet video website that embraces free-speech principles, consequently attracting many right-wing Americans.

        "title": "Decoding General Motors Co (GM): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) showcases a robust recovery, reclaiming the U.S. market share leader crown with a 16.4% share. GM's commitment to an all-electric future is underscored by its ambitious EV capacity targets and innovative Ultium platform. Operational challenges persist, with the cessation of Cruise's driverless AV robotaxi services highlighting the risks in AV strategy. GM's financial arm, GM Financial, continues to support the company's growth, leveraging its position since the acquisition of AmeriCredit.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with GM.\n\nOn January 30, 2024, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) filed its annual 10-K report, revealing a company at the forefront of the automotive industry's transformation. GM has successfully navigated the challenges of the previous year, regaining its position as the U.S. market share leader with a significant increase to 16.4%. The company's financial health is reflected in its robust balance sheet and strategic investments in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs), despite the recent halt in Cruise's operations. With a market capitalization of approximately $52.9 billion as of mid-2023 and a strong dealer network, GM is poised to capitalize on its strengths while addressing the inherent risks in the industry. Decoding General Motors Co (GM): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nMarket Share Leadership and Brand Equity: GM's resurgence as the U.S. market leader is a testament to its strong brand equity and customer loyalty. The company's portfolio, particularly its full-size ICE SUVs and pickup trucks, continues to drive profitability, reflecting GM's ability to meet consumer demands effectively. This strength is bolstered by GM's strategic focus on maintaining a competitive edge in design, quality, safety, and innovation.\n\nAdvancements in EV and AV Technologies: GM's vision for an all-electric future is supported by its Ultium platform, a flexible EV propulsion architecture that promises to revolutionize the market. With plans to have an annual EV capacity of one million units in North America by 2025, GM is positioning itself as a leader in the EV space. Additionally, the company's investments in AV technology, despite recent setbacks, underscore its commitment to innovation and future mobility solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on High-Margin ICE Vehicles: GM's near-term success is heavily reliant on the profitability of its full-size ICE SUVs and pickup trucks. While these vehicles are currently lucrative, shifts in consumer preferences or regulatory changes could impact demand and profitability. This dependence on a specific segment makes GM vulnerable to market fluctuations and necessitates a strategic balance as it transitions to EVs.\n\nOperational Risks in AV Strategy: The recent cessation of Cruise's driverless AV robotaxi services highlights the operational and regulatory challenges in GM's AV strategy. The development and commercialization of AV technology are fraught with risks, including technological hurdles, capital access, manufacturing complexities, and competitive pressures. GM must navigate these challenges to realize the potential of its AV investments.\n\nOpportunities\n\nGrowth in EV and Software-Enabled Services: GM's commitment to scaling EV production and expanding its software-enabled services presents significant growth opportunities. The company's focus on software platforms like OnStar and ADAS, including Super Cruise technology, positions it to capitalize on the increasing demand for connected and autonomous driving experiences. These initiatives could attract new customers and open revenue streams beyond traditional vehicle sales.\n\nNew Business Ventures: GM's incubation of new businesses, such as GM Defense, offers the opportunity to diversify its revenue base and leverage its technological expertise in new markets. By addressing the needs of defense and government customers for electric, autonomous, and connected solutions, GM can tap into a niche yet potentially lucrative market segment.\n\nThreats\n\nIntense Industry Competition: The automotive industry is characterized by fierce competition, with manufacturers constantly innovating to offer superior products and services. GM faces the challenge of maintaining its competitive position against traditional OEMs and new entrants from the technology sector. The company must continue to innovate and adapt to changing market dynamics to protect its market share and profitability.\n\nRegulatory and Economic Uncertainties: GM operates in a highly regulated industry, with vehicle emissions, fuel economy standards, and safety regulations influencing its operations. Additionally, the cyclical nature of the vehicle market, influenced by economic conditions and consumer spending, poses a threat to consistent performance. GM must proactively manage these external factors to mitigate their impact on its business.\n\nIn conclusion, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) presents a compelling case of resilience and strategic foresight in an evolving automotive landscape. The company's strengths in market share leadership, brand equity, and technological advancements in EV and AV set a solid foundation for future growth. However, GM must address its weaknesses, including its dependence on high-margin ICE vehicles and the operational risks associated with its AV strategy. Opportunities for expansion in EV and software-enabled services, along with new business ventures, offer promising avenues for diversification and revenue generation. Nonetheless, threats from intense industry competition and regulatory uncertainties require vigilant management and adaptive strategies. As GM continues to navigate these dynamics, its ability to leverage strengths, mitigate weaknesses, seize opportunities, and counteract threats will be critical in shaping its trajectory in the competitive automotive industry.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, January 30, 2024. \r\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAshish Kohli\n\nThank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter and calendar year 2023. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. \r\nOn today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the safe harbor statements on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language. \r\nAnd with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.\n\nStory continues\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nThanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. As we begin 2024, I believe GM is well positioned for a year of strong financial performance that builds on everything we accomplished and importantly learned in 2023. Consensus is growing that the U.S. economy, the job market and auto sales will continue to be resilient. At GM, we expect healthy industry sales of about 16 million units. We have an unmatched ICE portfolio in North America, rising EV production on the Ultium platform and GM Financial continues to perform well. \r\nWe're building on a foundation of products that our customers love. In 2023, GM sold more vehicles in the U.S. than anyone else. All of our U.S. brands grew their sales year-over-year, and we gained U.S. market share with healthy margins, thanks to stable pricing and incentives that were more than 20% below the industry average. The Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV had record sales. We led the industry in initial quality for the second year in a row according to J.D. Power. And we now have led the industry in combined pickup, full-size van and full-size SUV sales for 10 consecutive years, making us the leader in the highest ATP quadrant of the market and helping us lead the commercial fleet market. \r\nAnd we have passed Honda and Toyota in the most affordable quadrant, thanks to attractive and profitable vehicles like the Chevrolet Trax, which is one of Car and Driver's 10 best trucks and SUVs, and the Buick Envista, which is winning with younger buyers. In fact, more than 1 in 4 Envista customers are between the ages of 18 and 35. \r\nThe broad-based momentum we have today is important for our future because our customers are the most loyal in the industry. All of this success contributed to full year EBIT adjusted of $12.4 billion and adjusted auto free cash flow of $11.7 billion in 2023, which brings our total to more than $22 billion for '22 and '23. \r\nAlmost 2/3 of that cash is being returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including the impact of the $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we announced in November. Through the ASR, we immediately retired 215 million common shares in the fourth quarter. Our current share count is less than 1.2 billion, and we are working to reduce this even further to less than 1 billion common shares outstanding, which would be about 600 million fewer than at our peak. \r\nAs we look ahead, our priorities and our commitments are clear. They are to maximize the opportunities we have with our winning ICE portfolio, grow our EV business profitably, deliver strong margins and cash flow and refocus and relaunch Cruise. Across the enterprise, we are taking important steps to deliver on each priority. \r\nLet's start with our ICE portfolio. Chevrolet's crossover lineup had record sales last year. And this year, we're enhancing 2 of its most important models, which compete in growing segments. For example, Super Cruise will be available on the Traverse for the first time, and we will introduce a new Premium Z71 off-road model. \r\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Equinox that we unveiled last week is another great example. It has more standard safety equipment, new truck-inspired styling and a strong focus on technology. And importantly, both the Traverse and Equinox will have higher projected margins than the outgoing model. \r\nBuick and GMC are also launching new crossovers this year to keep our momentum going. In our EV business, we expect our U.S. portfolio to be variable product positive in the second half of the year based on our current expectations for EV demand and production growth. Strong interest in our vehicles, lower commodity prices and other factors will support this. \r\nOur plan is to produce and wholesale 200,000 to 300,000 Ultium-based Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac and BrightDrop EVs in North America this year, but we will be guided by customer demand. It's true the pace of EV growth has slowed, which has created some uncertainty. We will build to demand, and we are encouraged that many third-party forecasts have U.S. EV deliveries rising from about 7% of the industry in '23 to at least 10% in 2024, which would mean another year of record EV sales. \r\nWe believe our competitive position will improve throughout the year based on higher production of the Cadillac LYRIQ, the GMC HUMMER EV, the Chevrolet Blazer EV and the Silverado EV Work Truck. We're also excited to have the Chevrolet Equinox EV and the Silverado EV RST, the GMC Sierra EV Denali and the Cadillac Escalade IQ arriving in showrooms over the course of the year. \r\nWe are confident in the design and performance of these vehicles. For example, the LYRIQ is driving growth at Cadillac. Its sales have increased sequentially every month since September, and January deliveries should be in line with December despite winter storms across the country. \r\nWe also have more than 10,000 -- or excuse me, 100,000 reservations and orders for EV pickups that we expect to fulfill in '24 and '25. However, if demand conditions change, we'll take advantage of our manufacturing flexibility in Spring Hill and Ramos to build more ICE models and fewer EVs. We can also mix between different EV products at Factory ZERO. Ultimately, we will follow the customer. The supply chain, manufacturing and software changes we have made will support our growth. On the battery front, our Ultium Cells joint venture is at full production in Ohio. And the new plant in Tennessee will begin shipping cells this quarter. \r\nIn addition, our supply chain team has moved very quickly to resource 2 minor cell components after the U.S. Treasury published its updated IRA guidelines in December. This change means that new production going forward of the Chevrolet Blazer EV and the Cadillac LYRIQ will qualify for the full $7,500 consumer credit. \r\nWe work closely with our dealers to ensure consistent pricing for our customers, which we estimate will impact no more than about 25,000 vehicles. Our battery module production is on schedule. The team has improved the automated equipment at our assembly plants used to build modules, and the installation of new high-capacity assembly lines should be complete by midyear. \r\nOur software and services team is on process of resolving the stability issues some customers have experienced with the Chevrolet Blazer EV that impacted their screens and charging experience. And they are working with a huge sense of urgency to lift the stop sales soon. We disappointed these customers, and we know it. We are determined to get the software right, and we will. We have made several organizational and process improvements that will help us deliver the best possible customer experience going forward. \r\nAmong several important organizational realignments, we established a software quality division within the software and services team that has been performing a retrospective on the Blazer EV and has improved the current software development and test processes across the enterprise. Outcomes of this activity are getting applied to all programs going forward. And they include improved standardization of the software development and release process, increased focus on test automation at the vehicle level and additional quality gates and metrics for software at the vehicle level. \r\nFrom a margin and cash flow perspective, we are making good progress on cost reduction and capital efficiency. Compared with 2022, our fixed costs net of depreciation and amortization will be down $2 billion as we exit 2024, which will offset the impact of higher labor costs. We are also beginning to see savings from winning with simplicity. And all of our current and future programs have embraced this very important way of designing products. Each team is responsible for creating trim series that make vehicles easy to order with the content customers want and far fewer standalone options. \r\nBy making more equipment standard and trim series with logical price walks, we can eliminate literally thousands of unique part numbers and dozens of software releases. For example, we have eliminated over 1,000 selectable options across our current and near-term product programs, which is reducing hardware, software, ordering and manufacturing complexity and importantly, all the costs associated with them. In 2024, the savings are expected to be about $200 million. To be clear, we're talking about $200 million of savings to execute the same product plan. These savings will grow over time as we apply the discipline to future products like our next-generation full-size pickups. \r\nWe're also continuing to balance capital priorities and consistent free cash flow generation. We expect that our 2024 capital spending will be in the $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, which is roughly flat year-over-year and down considerably from the $13 billion top of our initial 2023 guidance. Our forward plans include bringing our plug-in hybrid technology to select vehicles in North America. Let me be clear, GM remains committed to eliminating tail-type emissions from our light-duty vehicles by 2035. \r\nBut in the interim, deploying plug-in technology in strategic segments will deliver some of the environmental benefits of EVs as the nation continues to build its charging infrastructure. We are timing the launches to help us comply with the more stringent fuel economy and tailpipe emission standards that are being proposed. And we plan to deliver the program in a capital- and cost-efficient way because the technology is already in production in other markets. We'll have more to share about this down the road. \r\nMoving to Cruise. Last week, we released the results of the third-party reviews, and we've already begun to implement significant changes to build a better Cruise. We are committed to earning back the trust with our regulators and the public through our actions. Our planned 2024 investment in Cruise reflects our more deliberate and cadence go-to-market strategy. And we are developing new financial targets and a new road map. \r\nSpending will be down considerably this year, but we will continue to invest in the people who are advancing the software, specialized hardware and AI capabilities. This reflects our commitment to our vision, which is to deliver the safety benefits of self-driving technology and a scalable, profitable business. I look forward to sharing our timetable for returning Cruise AVs to the road soon. \r\nTo summarize, we learned a lot in 2023. And those learnings are helping us build our strengths and addressing our challenges. Everyone on the team is committed to building on our momentum and creating shareholder value. \r\nYou'll see in our proxy statement this spring, executive compensation is tied even more closely to delivering our comprehensive ICE, EV, AV and software plans while meeting our financial targets. So our goals are truly aligned with yours. \r\nBefore I turn the call over to Paul, I would like to share some thoughts about our next Investor Day. Because of the significant changes that are underway at GM and Cruise, we think it makes sense to wait until later in the year to host an event. This will give our software team the time to focus on software for our upcoming launches. And we will be able to share more tangible proof points on all 4 pillars of our strategy: ICE, EV, AV and software. When we do get together, we will show you what we've done, not just tell you what we're going to do. In the meantime, we've already provided a road map for EV profitability in 2025. And we'll share updates on Cruise as we finalize the technology and relaunch plans. \r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Paul to go through our 2023 financials and provide more details on our 2024 outlook. Then we'll take your questions.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nThank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you all joining us this morning. I'd like to begin by recognizing the entire GM team for what they accomplished in 2023. And when you look back over the last couple of years, the results show an impressive trend in revenue growth, EPS consistency and cash generation. \r\nFor the full year, our EBIT adjusted of $12.4 billion came in slightly above the midpoint of the range we guided to in November, thanks to the continued strength of the core business. We grew revenue by 10% year-over-year to a record $172 billion and generated $7.68 of EPS diluted adjusted. \r\nA key focus has been profitable growth. And for the full year, we demonstrated this by growing U.S. market share by 30 basis points while keeping incentives well below industry averages. It's important to mention the 2023 actions we've taken to reduce fixed costs and the progress made on the $2 billion net cost reduction program. For example, automotive engineering was reduced by $400 million driven by portfolio simplification, realizing the benefits from winning with simplicity as well as our drive to virtual engineering. \r\nMarketing spend was reduced by $500 million, and we expect another $400 million this year. And we saw approximately $500 million from lower BrightDrop and other growth business spend along with the impact of the voluntary separation program across the enterprise. These $1.4 billion of fixed cost reductions were partially offset by $400 million of higher depreciation and amortization, meeting our target to achieve half of the $2 billion program in 2023. \r\nWe began 2023 with $24 billion of auto cash and marketable securities, generated full year adjusted auto free cash flow of $11.7 billion and returned approximately $12 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including the impact of the $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program initiated in Q4. \r\nComing into 2024, we are well positioned with roughly $20 billion of auto cash and marketable securities. And we'll appropriately balance our capital allocation priorities with the plan to continue to return capital to our shareholders through repurchases and our new higher dividend rate. \r\nLet's get into Q4 results. Total company revenue was $43 billion, consistent year-over-year despite the impact of the strike. However, we did have a number of cost items that we do not expect to reoccur in 2024 that impacted our margin performance in the quarter. We achieved $1.8 billion in EBIT adjusted, 4.1% EBIT-adjusted margins and $1.24 in EPS diluted adjusted. These results were also impacted by the strike, which had a $900 million EBIT-adjusted impact in Q4 and a $1.1 billion impact for the full year, primarily from losing an estimated 95,000 units of production. \r\nAdditionally, we increased our inventory valuation allowances by $1.1 billion to remeasure battery cell and EV inventory held at year-end. This adjustment was significantly larger in Q4 versus prior quarters driven by a combination of increasing cell production in preparation for our 2024 EV acceleration and holding more EVs in company inventory. Adjustments for the full year totaled $1.7 billion. We expect this to be substantially lower in 2024 as we continue to make progress toward our EBIT margin targets on EVs. \r\nNorth America delivered Q4 EBIT adjusted of $2 billion, down $1.6 billion year-over-year driven primarily by the $900 million strike impact and $1 billion of inventory adjustments I just discussed. The performance was also driven by higher pricing and lower fixed costs, which more than offset mix headwinds. \r\nNorth America margin of 8.7% was within our targeted 8% to 10% range for the full year and included a 1.6 percentage point impact from the strike and the inventory adjustments. Part of this performance is from proactively managing our inventory levels, helping to minimize incentives. \r\nI'm pleased that we ended the year at 50 days of U.S. inventory, which is at the low end of our 50- to 60-day target range and incentives that were more than 20% below the industry average. GM International had another solid quarter with Q4 EBIT adjusted of $300 million, which was consistent year-over-year. I want to thank the entire international team for another year of good execution and delivering $1.2 billion of EBIT adjusted. \r\nGM Financial also performed well with Q4 EBT adjusted of $700 million, down slightly year-over-year. Full year results were $3 billion, at the top end of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion guidance range. Portfolio credit metrics continue to be strong in part due to a predominantly prime credit mix with net charge-offs up slightly due to moderation in credit performance. GM Financial has consistently been an integral part of the business, supporting our customers, supporting our dealers and paying dividends of $1.8 billion to GM in 2023. Cruise expenses were $800 million in the quarter, up $300 million year-over-year and similar to the spend level in Q3. \r\nSo let's look ahead to 2024. We expect EBIT adjusted in the $12 billion to $14 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted to be in the $8.50 to $9.50 range, including an estimated $1.45 per share benefit from last year's accelerated share repurchase based on the current share price, which will be partially offset by roughly $0.50 headwind from a higher tax rate and lower interest income on lower cash balances. And adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $8 billion to $10 billion range for the year. \r\nI want to summarize a few items in 2023 that we don't expect to repeat and will help to contribute to our higher outlook for this year despite some of the potential macro headwinds. These include the $800 million EBIT-adjusted impact from the LG agreements. And as a reminder, this will save us an additional $1,000 per vehicle going forward on our path to EV profitability. $1.1 billion EBIT-adjusted impact from the strike and a substantial amount of the $1.7 billion of net realizable value adjustments as we work through the cell inventory, improve EV profitability and benefit from lower lithium prices. \r\nIn light of the current macro environment, we anticipate a market similar to 2023 with total U.S. industry volumes of around 16 million units. We expect wholesale volume to grow as we rebound from the impact of the strike and continue our track record of market share gains primarily from higher EV volume. However, we do assume mix headwinds from our ICE production driven by anticipated actions to proactively manage full-size truck inventory levels. We also assume a 2% to 2.5% pricing headwind year-over-year. But overall, we remain confident in our ability to balance production, inventory levels and profitability while growing revenues and sustain our North America margins in the 8% to 10% range. \r\nWe are on track to realize the remaining $1 billion of net fixed cost savings with the benefits coming from similar areas to last year, including marketing, engineering and the full year benefit of the actions we took in 2023. We expect $1.3 billion in higher labor costs along with logistics being a slight headwind year-over-year primarily due to -- driven by higher finished vehicle shipping costs. Cruise expenses are expected to be around $1 billion lower, given the new operational plan Mary mentioned earlier. \r\nIn November, we gave an update on our path to EV profitability with an estimated EBIT margin improvement of more than 60 percentage points and a lower overall EV loss in '24 compared to '23 even when you exclude the impact of the inventory adjustments. This will largely be driven by higher EV volumes and fixed cost leverage from both EV and battery cell manufacturing along with the benefit of all of our North America volume being on the Ultium platform. We are already seeing an improvement in cell costs today driven by significantly lower raw material prices and better pricing on cells produced at our first battery JV plant from higher capacity utilization. \r\nFor GM International, we expect relative stability in our South America and Middle East operations. However, we anticipate ongoing pressure in China, including the plan to reduce production in Q1 to balance dealer inventory levels. These actions will likely result in Q1 China equity income being a slight loss with a return to profitability starting in Q2. \r\nFor GM Financial, we expect EBT-adjusted again in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range with credit performance and used vehicle prices returning to normal throughout the year along with earning asset growth from retail loan originations and the commercial loan portfolio. We are forecasting another year of robust automotive adjusted free cash flow, but we anticipate modest year-over-year headwinds from '23 working capital benefits that we assume will not repeat and the timing of payments associated with accruals recognized last year, for example, warranty, tax and higher assumed inventory levels. \r\nFrom a modeling perspective, remember that Q1 is our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter of the year. We expect our capital spend to be similar to 2023, inclusive of $500 million to $1 billion of investments in our battery JVs. \r\nOur 2024 effective tax rate is assumed to be in the range of 18% to 20%, up from last year primarily due to the global mix of earnings and lower R&D credits primarily due to lower Cruise spend. And our full year EPS guidance assumes a weighted average fully diluted share count of slightly below 1.15 billion shares. This includes the impact of the remaining shares to be purchased through the ASR, which we expect will reduce our fully diluted share count to below 1.1 billion shares once completed. The actual share count will depend on several factors that impact the final ASR settlement, including the average share price during execution and excludes the impact of any incremental share repurchases beyond the ASR. \r\nIn closing, we know the EV market is not going to grow linearly. And we are prepared to flex between ICE and EV production, given our unique manufacturing capabilities to balance inventory levels and to build customer demand. This will help support pricing and our continued incentive discipline. While we have faced some challenges in our EV transition, we are actively working to address them and remain excited about our future and look forward to a successful 2024. \r\nThis concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question from the line comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nCongratulations. Just a couple of questions on the outlook. First, maybe can you share what you're assuming for end-of-year U.S. dealer inventory days supply? And on the pricing, Paul, I think you mentioned 2%, 2.5%. Maybe talk a bit of what you're assuming for individual segments there?\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nYes, Itay, thanks for your comments and your questions. First, on the inventory question, what I would say is we're continuing to pursue our targeted range of 50 to 60 days on hand of inventory. I think the team has done a really good job of balancing that. And I think that's provided some of the ability to be disciplined with incentives and clearly, has, I think, resulted in a competitive advantage for us that we've utilized for the last couple of years. As we think about that 2% to 2.5%, similar to what we've done for the last couple of years, I would call that a planning assumption rather than an expectation of where we see pricing. We want to make sure that we do that to make sure -- to ensure that we can hit our targets, generate the cash flow that's needed for investment and drive the free cash flow performance. \r\nSo as similar to years past, if we don't see that, I would expect that we can get some upside into the numbers that we've talked about. So we haven't gone through and assigned an expectation to any particular categories. That's something top-sided we do in the planning process. I hope that helps.\n\nItay Michaeli\n\nIt does help. A quick follow-up. On the second half target on EV positive VP per unit, can you just talk about what you're assuming for the broader competitive environment, maybe how much cushion you have on the price mix side and still be able to hit those targets?\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nSo without getting into very detailed specifics because obviously, it can get quite complicated, what I would say is we feel confident about hitting that variable profit positive target in probably the low 200,000 units of the range that Mary mentioned. That's based on a pretty consistent demand profile. So as we've seen the demand for the vehicles that we're producing and the way that customers have received them, we think we can keep that up. So to the extent that we see any pricing softness or demand retreat, we might have to revisit that. But we feel very good about the trajectory that we're on right now.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.\n\nRod Avraham Lache\n\nWanted to just first ask like from the outside at least, it looks like there's a lot more scrutiny being applied to capital allocation. I'm thinking about the posture that you're talking about for Cruise and BrightDrop and the adjustments to EV spending. So my question is just on the surface, it looks like the pendulum has moved a little bit from growth to cash flow. Are these kind of temporary changes or are you kind of thinking about adjustments to GM strategy?\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nRod, thanks for your comments. I wouldn't -- necessarily it's a change in our strategy. I think as we've continued to progress in the EV transformation, we have found more ways to be much more efficient with capital. And I do want to correct the statement I made earlier where I said we'd eliminated 1,000 selectable options across our portfolio. It was really 100, although I think I have a new stretch target for the team as we take the initiative global. \r\nBut it's initiatives like that of continuing to look for ways to optimize the capital. When you look at our ICE portfolio, the investment that we made in the last part of the last decade really sets up -- sets us up well to have all new products coming off the existing platforms, whether it's full-size trucks, full-size SUVs, midsize SUVs, et cetera. And so we're looking to continue to be very focused with capital to make sure it's going to generate the right return. And I would also say we are prioritizing continuing to return cash to our shareholders as we go through this transformation because we think the strength of our business, especially our ICE business, allows us to do that. \r\nSo it's not a change in strategy. I would say on some of the business you mentioned like BrightDrop and others, as we look at the business, I think it was important as we started them to give them some room, but as we got clarity on where the real opportunity for GM was, we can make those businesses much more efficient. And we're going to continue to do that to work on our cost structure to make every dollar of capital count. But we still see growth opportunity. I mean we had a revenue growth of 10% last year. So we're still -- we still have many initiatives in which to grow. We're just going to do it in a very optimized way.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dan Ives with Wedbush.\n\nDaniel Harlan Ives\n\nSo can you just talk about Cruise? What are sort of the targets for this year that we should think about that would just give more confidence that we've turned the corner there? I mean from an investor perspective and how you look into that long term. I mean you are committed to Cruise, right? That's the best way to think about that one to get through some of these situations.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nYes. Appreciate the question, Dan. We are committed to Cruise. When we look at the technology, the foundational technology is sound. We had already demonstrated and validated externally that Cruise technology is already safer than a human driver. One of the things we've learned is humans expect technology computers to be much more safe than their expectations that they have for other people. And with that knowledge, we are already working on what the level of the technology needs to be to meet the consumers' expectations. We think we can do that. \r\nSo we are committed, and we are working on the detailed plan right now of how we'll go forward. We're also looking -- the other big learning was as you roll out technology that is as transformative as this and has incredible benefits to safety, you have to do it in a way where you're really working with the regulators at the local, state and federal level as well as first responders. \r\nSo as we roll out anywhere, we're going to make sure we build the right relationships, they understand the technology, they understand the benefit of the technology, and that's what we'll do. But we have confidence in the underlying technology, and you'll hear more about our plans for Cruise as we develop the plan in the upcoming weeks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Joseph Spak with UBS.\n\nJoseph Robert Spak\n\nMaybe just back to the EVs, Mary and Paul. I mean you talked about the positive variable profit. It sounds like the LC NRV charge going lower is a big portion of that, but you also mentioned some other factors. So I was wondering if you could give a little bit more detail there. And then is this something that you will continually give us on a quarter-by-quarter basis to sort of track the progress you're making towards that positive variable profit?\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nJoe, it's Paul. Thanks for the questions. Probably just to digress for a second on the lower cost or market adjustment on the EV inventory. So a couple of things. Number one, they're not in -- that's not in any of the metrics that I think are important. Clearly, it is a year-over-year benefit for us on our journey. But when you think about the 2 metrics that we're looking at, there isn't an impact from that. \r\nSo first is variable profit positive. This relates a lot more to sort of EBIT and how we think about that going forward. But variable profit is mainly benefiting from scale and lower material costs going forward, so not a contributor to that. And then when you think about getting to the mid-single-digit margin target in 2025, we would expect that there isn't really going to be inventory that's necessarily carrying that. And if there is, we'll call that out as we go forward. \r\nBut it's not in our calculations and not a part of what we think our journey is going to be. So I appreciate the question and not surprised by it, but we're continuing to march along. When you think about the -- sorry, the second part of your question was on? Apologies. What's the second part of your question? \r\nOh, on tracking. Yes, on when we'll disclose. We'll continue to talk about our journey and give confidence as far as specific data points. Not sure that we're going to do it quarterly yet, but we'll continue to update on our progress.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.\n\nAdam Michael Jonas\n\nJust one question, one follow-up. I want to follow up on Rod's question first on strategy. Can you confirm what portion of your forward year CapEx and R&D is dedicated to EV battery, AV projects, the Auto 2.0? Any reason to think that this -- that you may have scope to dial back the vertical integration, given the changing market? \r\nAnd then my follow-up and again, because I think in the past, where you've talked about well over half, I think you said in recent years of your spending was on that, but I just wanted to know if that was changing. And then the follow-up was on Elon Musk recently said that in the absence of trade barriers that China will demolish most of the Western EV players. Curious your reaction to that comment, whether you'd agree.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nYes. Thanks, Adam. So from a capital perspective and to build on what I said with Rod, the majority of our capital spend is toward EV. Remember, from an ICE perspective, we have the foundation, already built the plant. And as I mentioned, all of the architectures for our really strong ICE portfolio, that capital has already been deployed. So this is really an opportunity for us to just continue to do great vehicles with very optimized capital from an ICE portfolio as mentioned with the Traverse, the Equinox and the full-size truck, just to name a few. \r\nTo your point on capital deployed from an infrastructure perspective, as the market evolves and as battery technology evolves, we will continue to evaluate our level of vertical integration. I think with the work we've done on Ultium and the work we've done on electric motors and the joint ventures with plant 1, 2 and 3, and then 4 -- our fourth plant is with Samsung, that gives us a different form factor with prismatic and cylindrical cells, I think we're well positioned. \r\nBut as we move forward, we'll evaluate that. So I think there's options there. And as you can see, with all the initiatives we have, we are really working to take overall capital down but still get the number of programs that we need. So Adam, I hope that helps. Happy if you have additional questions there. \r\nAnd then on Elon's comments about China. I think, look, I don't discount any competitor. We need to make sure we have beautifully designed vehicles that have the right features, the right safety and the right customer experience. And we have to do it at a competitive cost base, and that's why we're focused so much on our cost base. \r\nNow when you mentioned the Chinese consumers, we do need a level playing field. I mean there comes a point where if it's not a level playing field between tariff and nontariff barriers, any industry is going to struggle to compete. So give us a level playing field, and I'll put our products in our cost structure that we continue to improve up against any.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.\n\nJohn Joseph Murphy\n\nMary, I just wanted to follow up on the strategy line that Adam and Rod have breached here. I mean we're seeing fits and starts in technology, and it will eventually get there. But at the same time, we are seeing this tectonic shift in competition, particularly coming from China, as Adam alluded to. You made sort of pronouncements and how the business strategy will be set up for a few years not too long ago. But these shifts have been pretty extreme more recently. \r\nSo I'm just curious, as you think about strategy and the position of the company, you haven't been shy from making big changes in the past like exiting Europe. Can we think about the potential for real shifts in strategy of focus where the highest margin and highest return is sort of in the business truly 5 to 10 years down the line, which might include things like exiting China, which sounds like heresy but might be the best move to make for 5 years out, maybe rebranding Cruise and really kind of taking a new sort of approach to where the company will land in 5 to 10 years. It's really protect profitability and cash flow from a position of strength instead of maybe a position in 5 to 10 years where it might be a weaker position.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nJohn, thanks for the question. And we continue to evaluate the strategy on a regular basis. We have very robust strategy discussions with our Board and with the leadership team. And as you mentioned, the world is changing quickly whether it's EV, whether it's software, autonomy, et cetera, and we're going to continue to respond to that. I do agree with you that we're doing that from a position of strength. And we'll evaluate where we have the opportunity to deploy capital and generate an appropriate return. \r\nAnd like we made the decision for China -- or excuse me, for Europe, when we looked at that, what we said actually has happened. We said it would be a win-win-win, a win for the Opel team, a win for at the time, PSA and a win for General Motors because we participate in the warrants, and we did just that. \r\nSo we're not going to shy away from making tough calls or maybe calls that people wouldn't expect if we think it's the right thing to do for the business to ensure we're here. We protect our strengths in the markets that we have, whether it's North America. I mentioned on the earnings call, in the top quartile, we've been leading that for several years, and now we profitably have taken the most affordable segment. And we have a strong business in South America in many of our international markets. China, as Paul mentioned, there's tremendous changing not only from a technology point of view but a competitive point of view. \r\nAnd so we're evaluating China. We think there's a place to play. It is a tremendous growth opportunity if we can do that well, and that's our goal. But nothing is off the table in ensuring that GM has a strong future to generate the right profitability and the right return for our investors.\n\nJohn Joseph Murphy\n\nAnd if I could just sneak one follow-up on the plug-in hybrid comment of potentially bringing those here to the U.S. to fill sort of maybe this interim gap. What kind of capacity or volume could you hit there here in the U.S.? I know the dealers are clamoring for those vehicles.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nYes. We are going to be bringing those in at a time where we need them from a compliance perspective. This year, we're very focused in -- I think as we are able to get the delivery to our dealers that are going to see the strength of the EV portfolio. So I'll have more to share on the hybrid capacity. \r\nWe'll adjust the capacity because, again, we have the technology. We know the targeted segments that we're going to apply it to. So we'll have the ability to flex and do what we need to from a hybrid perspective. But I think for calendar year '24, EV is our focus. And we think we've got tremendous growth opportunity as we free up getting the availability of the products to customers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.\n\nRyan Joseph Brinkman\n\nObviously, the '24 outlook is far stronger than investors expected. How much of that higher outlook versus consensus do you think stems from different industry-related factors that are a matter of debate such as expectations for volume or pricing in different markets versus how much do you think stems from company-specific factors that you would naturally have a better handle on internal to the company such as lower Cruise spending, a potential for more structural cost reduction, the magnitude of guidance to the fact you may be more positive on industry factors, but your pricing comments also seemed pretty in line. So not really sure. How are you thinking about like how much of your meeting this great guide in '24 will come down to factors under your control versus out of your control?\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nSo Ryan, thanks for the question. I'll take a shot at that. When you look at the macro backdrop, I think we're approaching it pretty consistently to what we have for the last few years. So we've talked about a 16 million SAAR, about 2% to 2.5% of sort of total pricing pressure across the board. A lot of it is, I would say, a testament to what we achieved and overcame in 2023 that we don't expect to repeat. \r\nOf course, there will be some things that pop up as there are every year. And I think the team has done a good job of knocking those things down and overcoming some of those challenges going forward. So against the macro backdrop, that feels a little bit consistent with some conservatism in there on the pricing side of it. I think a lot of it is on our ability to execute. And we have had a lot of challenges, as Mary mentioned. I think '23 was a big year of learning for us. But as she talked about with the work that we're doing on the module assembly and where we see EV ramp as well as the customer response to the EVs that we're producing, I think this is a year of our executing and a lot of it is in our control.\n\nRyan Joseph Brinkman\n\nOkay. Great. I just wanted to ask on Cruise too, starting with whether the guided $1 billion of lower spending in '24 versus the '23 full year $2.7 billion figure or maybe the 4Q run rate of $3.2 billion. And then what has the response been so far? I realize there hasn't been a lot of time passed, but from the regulators to the recently released comprehensive review. \r\nPreviously, I think you've guided to potentially significantly less than the non-Cruise, maybe on the business update call, but then followed a day or 2 later at Barclays by saying several hundred million, now it's $1 billion. So of course, you were still waiting for the review at that point. Is there anything to read into the $1 billion being higher than several hundred million? Is that maybe the reception of the review could lead to a more prolonged suspension of commercial operations? \r\nAnd then just finally, the outlook for the EBIT loss in '24 or whatever it is $1.7 billion or $2.7 billion, it's greater than the $1.3 billion of cash that Cruise had at year-end, right, on, I think, Slide 26 or so. So just capital raise, curious on the thoughts there.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nRyan, there's a lot in there, but let me first by saying the response from regulators has been positive. So -- and we'll continue to have that outreach and build that relationship and be transparent with them. You shouldn't read too much into what we said, shortly thereafter we learned the situation. We went in and did a lot of work. And I got a -- I have to give our co-presidents, Craig Glidden and Mo Elshenawy credit for going in and really staying focused on the technology, making sure we keep the very talented software engineers that are doing incredible work and have allowed us to already clock 5 million miles of driverless miles. \r\nSo it was really just going to look a lot of where the opportunity to cut costs came from, the change in strategy to really focus on one city to demonstrate it as opposed to -- you remember at one point, they were talking about 20 cities this year. And so there were a lot of people who had been recently added more from an operational standpoint that we were able to exit those employees. \r\nBut clearly a focus on the technology. And the way I look at this is we're going to make sure we do it right from a regulatory, a consumer, a customer relationship perspective, get the technology where we think it would be. And then once we're informed by doing it well in the cities, then we'll have the opportunity to go quickly and scale from there. So don't read anything into the $1 billion other than we went and did the work and saw the opportunity.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays.\n\nDan Meir Levy\n\nTwo questions on cash. One is you're guiding to $8 billion to $10 billion of free cash. And that pro forma gets your cash balance on the balance sheet to something like $28 billion to $30 billion at the end of 2024. To what extent are you willing to put forward another share buyback plan beyond what you have if the target is to have cash balance of $20 billion? \r\nAnd the second question is on Cruise, on cash. They're at roughly $1.3 billion. I think that gives you a little less than a year of runway on cash. So what's the plan on further funding for Cruise?\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nSo on the further funding on Cruise, I'll take that, and I'll have Paul answer the other question. As we get the detailed plan of how we're going to relaunch Cruise in the road map, then we'll evaluate the overall funding needs. And we'll determine is it internal or externally sourced.\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nAnd Dan, on your question on cash, I think the simple math is correct. We would obviously see a sizable increase in our cash balance. Our capital allocation stance remains the same, which is to invest in the business. And we've talked about $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion of CapEx this year. \r\nWe have been streamlining that and making that efficient and a priority to drive free cash flow. And as we look at the balance sheet, I think the balance sheet is in really good shape. And there's no change to our stance of, call it, $18 billion or about $20 billion of cash on hand. So clearly, we've demonstrated a renewed commitment and prioritization of returning cash to shareholders. And we'll maintain that flexibility going forward.\n\nDan Meir Levy\n\nJust to clarify, the $18 billion, $20 billion, is that a target or is that a floor?\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nThat's kind of been our floor/targeted range. Obviously, we've carried quite a bit more than that over the last few years as we dealt with some of the uncertainty. But as we imagine -- or as we said in November when we announced the share repurchase with a lot of that uncertainty behind us, lower CapEx spending, we felt comfortable operating at that lower balance. So $18 billion to $20 billion feels very comfortable as the targeted range.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nFirst of all, I was hoping to ask you about the scale required to achieve the EV profitability goals. So I think when you shared those goals back in November, in particular, the 60-point EBIT margin improvement this year, I think 60% of that came from scale. I'm curious if the 200,000 to 300,000 units you're planning for this year, is that enough to get you that scale piece? So are you counting more on like lower battery costs and maybe a bit of a shift in terms of some of the savings? \r\nAnd then similar question on the mid-single-digit EBIT margin target for next year. I think some of it was going to come from scale. What kind of unit volume you need to get the scale piece of -- to get to these targets?\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nEmmanuel, thanks for the questions. On the 2024 numbers, I think they're wholly consistent with the 200,000 to 300,000 range that we've articulated here. And as I mentioned earlier in response to a question around EVs, the low 200,000 is kind of what gets us to the point where we feel comfortable about getting the variable profit positive from there. \r\nObviously, growth is a component, but it's a much smaller component of the walk from '24 to '25 than it is from '23 to '24. But it will require some growth. We're not going to commit to that other than just to say kind of that's where we stand, and we'll see where customer demand is going forward. \r\nAnd the other point if I didn't make it earlier on the lower battery raw material costs, keep in mind that we don't start to see meaningful benefit from that until we get to the middle part of the year because a lot of the cells that we have in inventory were built with higher raw materials costs. \r\nSo while we're producing cells today, we're going first in, first out on the cells. So we have a little bit of a lag before we realize that. That lower battery raw material cost of about $4,000 a vehicle that we articulated, we'll also have some annualization benefits in 2025 since we're not getting a full benefit here in '24. I hope that's helpful.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nYes, very helpful. One very quick follow-up on Cruise. The spending, $1 billion lower for this year. Is that -- could that be considered sort of like a new run rate for spending? Or is it sort of like a temporary situation as a result of some of the path currently in the testing and rollout?\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nEmmanuel, I would consider it right now it's our best estimate for this year. Obviously, as we develop a much more detailed plan that will inform over the next couple of years what the spending needs to be, so more to come.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore.\n\nChristopher Patrick McNally\n\nGreat numbers. Mary, I just want to shift gears and talk maybe advanced ADAS and software really quickly. Super Cruise, you introduced in 2018. You don't put out too many usage numbers, but I think in the middle of last year, you talked about almost 100 million miles cumulatively. Even if we double that for time passage, it's not many vehicles, tens of thousands. We also read Ultra Cruise has now been installed. \r\nJust high level, isn't this a very slow pace for Level 2+ product? Tesla has been providing for a decade charging anywhere from 6,000 to 12,000 for top versions. I guess the question is, isn't this becoming a big miss opportunity for GM at this point for additional revenue? Even Slide 7, I think, only shows one of the ICE launches, the Traverse highlighting Super Cruise. So just a broad update when we could start to see what is a technology probably everyone wants at more sort of mass deployment scale across your fleet?\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nYes. Chris, appreciate the question. I think back in the '18 time frame, I think we should have, in hindsight, put it across the portfolio much more quickly. It's not a number of models. I don't have it off the top of my head. Ashish, we can provide that. But it's on a number of models across the portfolio right now. As we launch the Traverse this year will be added to the Traverse. \r\nAgain, we're seeing extremely strong response from customers where I think it's over 80%, 85% of customers once they experience the technology say they would never -- they would not want a car without it or they would strongly prefer it on their vehicle, which, in my experience, is a pretty high interest rate for a single technology. So we're committed. We're going to continue to develop. And we have been, along the way, adding more roads and adding more capability, whether it's lane change, whether it's trailering. \r\nSo there's a robust plan to continue to improve Super Cruise, and we'll stay on that. And we are seeing the profitability benefits. And the more vehicles to your point, we get it on, the better it will be. And we're committed to do that and frankly, have done quite a bit already. And we can provide that.\n\nChristopher Patrick McNally\n\nNo, that's -- and just in terms of the evolution of the speed, is it a technology bottleneck? Or is it more just marketing, meaning like you thought of it as a premium product, you charge sort of a premium rate compared to other GM add-ons? Or is it just like you said, there's a cost to putting it on every vehicle on the RD&E. So that could increase, but it would obviously be an engineering cost to get it on more vehicles.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nYes. No, we are committed to getting it on many vehicles as possible. In some cases, we had planned to make it standard. The semiconductor shortage kind of slowed us down on that because it was a choice of building a vehicle at all or waiting to build it with Super Cruise. \r\nSo we are very committed to getting across many vehicles. We've dramatically taken the cost down on the technology. So it's a really good value. And in my opinion, we're deploying it as quickly as we can. And it's really just with -- there is engineering required and some sensors required when you add it to a new vehicle, but we're doing that in a very cadenced but as quick as possible fashion.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from the line of Tom Narayan with RBC.\n\nGautam Narayan\n\nJust wanted to kind of make sure I got all the good points here on the bridge in 2023 to 2024 -- sorry, a boring question. You have, I guess, price down 2% to 2.5%, $200 million cost savings, Cruise down $1 billion, higher labor $1.3 billion. Three items not quantified were market share gains you guys called out in the slide, EV margin improvement, and the third is lower mix. Just curious if we could get a sense of order of magnitude for those 3 last buckets?\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nTom, I'll suggest that we take that off-line, work through any modeling details. But at the end of the day, clearly, the commercial market, as we talked about, we expect to be relatively stable and pricing down 2% to 2.5%. Not going to get into the specifics about how we're thinking about market share gains other than to say, fairly consistent about what we've been doing for the last few years going forward. And then on EVs, a lot of that, we will continue to talk about as we come to sort of later Investor Day and subsequent calls going forward. I think we've given good detail on the overall walk on a vehicle program level.\n\nGautam Narayan\n\nOkay. Sure. And as a quick follow-up, typically, when -- if an OEM, let's say, changes production levels, so in this case, EV, if you move to plug-in hybrids or what have you, there are monies that get paid to suppliers, right, for that, let's say, they have to cut production of EV components. Just curious if those supplier concessions if you were to, let's say, reduce EV production or shift to plug-in hybrids with -- are those something that you've envisioned in the 2024 guidance?\n\nPaul A. Jacobson\n\nSo Tom, I think our -- we've got great relationships with our suppliers and a team that works very, very closely with them. They have been, I would say, very patient with us over the last few years because we've had a lot of volatility. And in those situations where we need to help, we've been willing to do that going forward. And we always look at both efficiencies and any challenges in our annual budget process, and this year is no different.\n\nOperator\n\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks.\n\nMary T. Barra\n\nThank you very much. And thanks, everybody, for your questions. I'd like to share just a couple of thoughts before we close. \r\nFundamentally, we believe we are well positioned to have a strong year, thanks to our success in high-margin and growing ICE segments, our expanding EV portfolio, our cost discipline and our continuous improvements to design, engineering, supply chain, manufacturing and marketing process improvements. \r\nIn addition, we are prioritizing the return of cash to our shareholders on a consistent basis as we execute the plan. We know we must execute in every part of the business in '24, not just ICE. And I can assure you we will. So thank you for your continued support and for joining today's call, and please stay safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining.",
